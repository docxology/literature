Abstract — Lowering radiation dose per view and 
utilizing sparse views per scan are  two common CT scan 
modes, albeit often leading to distorted images 
characterized by  noise and streak artifacts.   Blind image 
quality assessment (BIQA) strives to evaluate perceptual 
quality in alignment with what radiologists perceive, which 
plays an important role in  advancing low-dose CT  
reconstruction techniques.  An intriguing direction involves 
developing BIQA methods that mimic the operational 
characteristic of the human visual system (HVS).   The 
internal generative mechanism (IGM) theory reveals that the 
HVS actively deduces primary content to enhance  
comprehension. In this study, we introduce an innovative 
BIQA metric that emulates the active inference process of 
IGM.  Initially, an active inference module, implemented as 
a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is 
constructed to anticipate the primary content. Then, the 
dissimilarity map is derived by assessing the interrelation 
between the distorted image and its primary content.   
Subsequently, the distorted image and dissimilarity map 
are combined into a multi-channel image, which is inputted 
into a transformer -based image quality evaluator.  
Remarkably, by exclusively utilizing this transformer-based 
quality evaluator, we won the second place in the MICCAI 
2023 low-dose computed tomography perceptual image 
quality assessment grand challenge.  Leveraging the 
DDPM-derived primary content, our approach further 
improves the performance on the challenge dataset.

I. INTRODUCTION 
-RAY image quality assessment (IQA) plays a crucial role 
in computed tomography ( CT) imaging, facilitating the 
advancement of novel algorithms  for low-dose CT 
reconstruction. Two strategies for low-dose CT scans are either 
reducing the X -ray tube current or acquiring sparse view s. 
However, these strategies often introduce noise and/or streak 
artifacts in the filtered backprojection (FBP) images. To address 
these problems, deep learning-based methods have been used 
for low -dose CT im age denoising  [1-5] and sparse view CT 
reconstruction [6-10]. When the quality of these reconstructed

images is assessed , radiologist’s opinion s serve as the gold 
standard. Nonetheless, collecting these opinions is an expensive 
and intricate process, making it impractical for real -time and 
large-scale IQA tasks.  Consequently, peak signal -to-noise 
(PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) have 
been widely used as surrogate metrics [11]. However, both 
PSNR and SSIM  have shown limited  correlation with 
radiologists’ opinions on image quality, primarily due to their 
reliance on mathematical models that do not account for the 
intricacies of human perception. Moreover, the requirement for 
reference images to calculate these metrics poses challenges in 
clinical environments ; for example,  obtaining high-quality 
images is infeasible  without increasing patient radiation 
exposure. To overcome these limitations, one direction is to 
develop no-reference image quality metrics that correlates well 
with radiologists’ opinion on image quality. 
No-reference image quality assessment (NR -IQA), also 
known as blind IQA (BIQA) , is widely used to evaluate the 
quality of  natural image s [12-13]. Traditional BIQA methods 
typically comprise three steps . First, some handcrafted 
descriptors are employed  to extract quality -aware features  of 
training images. Then, the statistical distribution of the 
extracted features serves as the guidance. Some approaches also 
involve parameterizing this distribution through modeling. 
Finally, a mapping function , such as support vector regression 
(SVR) [14], is designed to convert the distributions  into a 
quality score. In traditional BIQA,  features are derived from 
various sources incl uding discrete wavelet transform (DWT)  
[15-17], discrete cosine transform (DCT)  [18] and spatial 
domain measures [19-20] to predict the perceptual quality. 
Alternatively, it is assumed that the human visual system (HVS) 
gauges image quality by discerning features like gradient [21], 
luminance contrast  [22] or local binary pattern  [23]. Certain 
approaches combine these extracted features to improve image 
quality assessment further [24-25]. Nevertheless, due to the 
complexities of image contents  and distortion patterns, the 
representation capabilities of handcrafted features are often 
unsatisfactory. 
In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has 
gained major attention in BIQA tasks because o f its potent 
X 
2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. xx, NO. x, 2020 
 
feature representation power [26-27] and started gaining 
momentum [28-33]. Rank-IQA utilizes synthetically generated 
distortions and a Siamese network to rank images based on their 
quality [29]. DBCNN demonstrates effectiveness with both  
synthetic and authentic  image distortions  [30]. Hyper-IQA 
segregates features into low-level and high -level categories, 
then transforms the latter to reshape the former’s influence [31]. 
Meta-IQA employes meta-learning to train the network s on 
distinct types of distortions, thereby acquiring prior knowledge 
[32]. More recently , vision transformers ( ViTs) [33] have 
emerged as competitive alternatives to CNNs. Their self -
attention mechanism empowers ViT to grasp global contextual 
information from an entire image, ensuring a comprehensive 
consideration of all image features of significance  for task-
specific prediction. This attribute aligns well with the 
requirements of BIQA task, which involves predicting a quality 
index globally [34-40]. MSTIQA leverages a Swin transformer 
to amalgamate features from multiple stages to enhance quality 
assessment [38]. MANIQA introduces a multi -dimensional 
attention network for BIQA . This approach introduces the 
transposed attention block and the multiscale Swin transformer 
block to strengthen global and local interactions  [39]. 
MAMIQA employs a lightweight attention mechanism that 
utilizes decomposed large kernel convolutions to extract  
multiscale features . Furthermore, it includes a feature 
enhancement module t o enrich local fine -grained details and 
global semantic information at multi-scales [40]. Among the 
various transformer -based BIQA methods , MANIQA has not 
only achieved the state-of-the-art performance in BIQA tasks 
but also secured the first place in the no -reference track of 
NTIRE 2022 perceptual image quality assessment challenge 
[41]. Intriguingly, the top three methods in this challenge all 
rely on transformer-based techniques, highlighting the efficacy 
of the transformers in BIQA tasks.  Nonetheless, the lack of 
reference information poses a challenge, preventing these 
methods from aligning seamlessly with the HVS and may 
adversely impacting their overall performance. 
The theory of i nternal generative mechanisms (IGMs) 
suggests that the HVS engages in an active process of deducing 
the primary content of an image during human evaluations [42-
44]. In this process, IGM initially analyzes pixel correlations 
within an input ima ge. In conjunction with intrinsic prior 
knowledge, IGM deduces the corresponding primary content as 
an active comprehension of the input  image [45]. The primary 
content consists of essential scene information, representing the 
structured, meaningful elemen ts within the image, which is 
transported to the high level of HVS for interpretation [46]. 
Thus, the ability to generate high -quality primary content 
becomes critical in emulating the HVS. Notably, recent 
successes in adapting and applying the denoising diffusion 
probabilistic model (DDPM) and other diffusion models have  
showcased their amazing capabilities in both image generation 
and restoration [47- 49]. These qualities underscore a huge  
potential of diffusion models in generating high-quality primary 
content, particularly in the context of low-dose CT imaging [50, 
51] which is featured by uniquely intricate noise and streak 
artifacts, quite different from what in natural images. 
Low-dose CT images frequently suffer from conspicuous 
noise and streak artifacts, being the primary culprits of the 
image quality deterioration. Specifically, t he streak  artifacts 
exhibit directional appearance contributing to  globalized 
artifacts in a whole image [6]. This makes the existing datasets 
of natural images  inadequate for accurately predicting quality 
scores of low-dose CT images.  On the other hand, given the 
scarcity of open datasets for low-dose CT BIQA, experiments 
have been conducted using disparate datasets, yielding results 
that are challenging to compare  and interpret  [52, 53]. These 
challenges demand a standardized image quality metric  in 
general, and for low-dose CT imaging in particular. Notably, a 
low-dose CT BIQA dataset has recently been unveiled for the 
MICCAI 2023 low-dose CT perceptual image quality 
assessment grand challenge [54]. As low-dose CT images are 
obtained by  reducing the number of projections per rotation 
and/or the X-ray tube current, the combination of sparse view 
streaks and noise needs to be dealt with in the challenge so that 
the best -performing IQA model can be identified and made 
applicable in real clinical environments.  
Given the globalized artifact patterns in low-dose CT images, 
we utilized a transformer-based quality evaluator [39] and won 
the second place in the MICCAI 2023 low-dose CT perceptual 
image quality assessment grand challenge  [54]. We found in 
our study that  directional artifacts may sometimes be  
misleading by resembling genuine anatomical structures. To 
further improve the performance , inspired by IGM  here we 
propose a novel approach utilizing a DDPM-based active 
inference for low-dose CT BIQA. At the outset, given DDPM’s 
capability to simultaneously eliminate noise and streak artifacts, 
we employ DDPM to generate high-quality primary content,  
closely mimicking the HVS. Recognizing the heightened 
sensitivity of HVS to structure s, the dissimilarity map is 
extracted from the distorted image and its primary content.  
After that, incorporating such diverse prior information as input, 
a multi -channel image is synthesized, amalgamating content, 
distortion, and structur al characteristics for comprehensive 
quality prediction.  The final step involves employing a 
transformer-based quality evaluator to predict the score.   
Empirical trials conducted on the low-dose CT BIQA challenge 
dataset systematically affirm the efficacy of our proposed 
method. 
In brief, the mai n contributions of this paper can be 
summarized as follows: 
1) We propose a  conditional DDPM to emulate the active 
inference process of IGM.  The proposed DDPM -based active 
inference module can effectively predict the primary content of

distorted images which contain intricate noise and streak 
artifacts from both low-dose and sparse view CT imaging.  
2) Based on the primary content, we introduce a transformer-
based quality evaluator to predict the image quality on a low -
dose CT BIQA dataset. Note that we secured the runne r-up 
position in the MICCAI 2023 low -dose CT perceptual image 
quality assessment grand challenge  by only employing this 
transformer-based quality evaluator . On that basis, we have 
improved the image quality assessment performance even 
further, as explained in detail below. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 
II outlines the process of utilizing a conditional DDPM to 
acquire both the primary content and the dis similarity map, 
while also detailing the transformer -based qualit y evaluator. 
Section III reports our evaluation results on  the low-dose CT 
BIQA challenge dataset.  Section IV discusses relevant issues 
and makes the conclusion.   
II. METHODOLOGY 
A. Conditional DDPM for Low-Dose CT 
To generate high -quality primary content for emulating the 
HVS, a typical deep learning method trains a network to learn 
a mapping from low -dose CT images to normal -dose CT 
images. Let us assume that 𝒚 ∈ ℝ𝑁 and 𝒙 ∈ ℝ𝑁 are paired low-
dose CT and normal -dose CT images. The parameters of the 
network can be trained as follows: 
min
𝜃
‖𝐷𝜃(𝒚) − 𝒙‖2
2                                   (1) 
where 𝐷𝜃 is the network parameterized by 𝜃, which is the key 
for producing high-quality images. 
Recently, DDPM has demonstrated superior performance in 
generating high -quality images from their distorted 
counterparts, particularly in complex scenarios involving 
multiple distortions, such as CT imaging.   
The architecture of the conditional DDPM is shown in Fig. 1.  
DDPM starts with a forward process that gradually adds noise 
to the normal-dose CT image 𝒙0 ∼ 𝑞(𝒙0) over the course of 𝑇 
timesteps according to a variance schedule 𝛽1, ⋯ , 𝛽𝑇: 
𝑞(𝒙𝑡|𝒙𝑡−1) = 𝒩(𝒙𝑡; √1 − 𝛽𝑡𝒙𝑡−1, 𝛽𝑡𝑰)              (2) 
𝑞(𝒙1:𝑇|𝒙0) = ∏ 𝑞(𝒙𝑡|𝒙𝑡−1)
𝑇
𝑡=1
                     (3) 
where 𝒙1, ⋯ , 𝒙𝑇 are latent variables of the same dimensionality 
as the sample  𝒙0 ∼ 𝑞(𝒙0).   
According to the properties of the Gaussian distribution, the 
sampling result 𝒙𝑡 at an arbitrary timestep 𝑡 can be written in 
the following closed form: 
𝑞(𝒙𝑡|𝒙0) = 𝒩(𝒙𝑡; √𝛼̅𝑡𝒙0, (1 − 𝛼̅𝑡)𝑰)              (4) 
where 𝛼𝑡 = 1 − 𝛽𝑡 and 𝛼̅𝑡 = ∏ 𝛼𝑖
𝑡
𝑖=1 .  
After the forward process, 𝒙𝑇  follows a standard normal 
distribution when 𝑇  is large enough.  Thus, if we know the 
conditional distribution 𝑞(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡) , we can use the reverse 
process to get a sample under 𝑞(𝒙0)  from 𝒙𝑇~𝒩(𝟎, 𝑰) . 
However, 𝑞(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡) depends on the entire data di stribution, 
which is hard to calculat e. Hence, a neural network was 
designed to learn a latent data distribution by gradually 
denoising a normal distribution variable, which corresponds to 
learning the reverse process of a fixed Markov Chain of length 
𝑇 conditioned on a low -dose CT image 𝒚. The reverse process 
can be defined as: 
𝑝𝜃(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡, 𝒚) =  𝒩(𝒙𝑡−1; 𝝁𝜃(𝒙𝑡, 𝒚, 𝑡), 𝜎𝑡
2𝑰)            (5) 
𝑝𝜃(𝒙0:𝑇|𝒚) = 𝑝(𝒙𝑇) ∏ 𝑝𝜃(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡, 𝒚)
𝑇
𝑡=1
                   (6) 
where 𝑝(𝒙𝑇)  is the density function of  𝒙𝑇 . In Eq. (6),  
𝝁𝜃(𝒙𝑡, 𝒚, 𝑡)  and 𝜎𝑡
2  are needed to solve 𝑝𝜃(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡, 𝒚) .  
According to the Bayes theorem, the posterior 𝑞(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0 ) 
are defined   as 
𝑞(𝒙𝑡−1|𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0 ) = 𝒩(𝒙𝑡−1; 𝝁̃𝑡(𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0), 𝜎𝑡
2𝑰)      (7) 
where 
𝝁̃𝑡(𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0) = √𝛼𝑡(1 − 𝛼̅𝑡−1)
1 − 𝛼̅𝑡
𝒙𝑡 + √𝛼̅𝑡−1(1 − 𝛼𝑡)
1 − 𝛼̅𝑡

𝜎𝑡
2 =
(1 − 𝛼̅𝑡−1)(1 − 𝛼𝑡)
1 − 𝛼̅𝑡
                      (9) 
Since 𝜎𝑡
2 is a constant, the most natural parameterization of 
𝝁𝜃(𝒙𝑡, 𝒚, 𝑡) is a neural network that predicts 𝝁̃𝑡(𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0) directly. 
Alternatively, given that 𝒙𝑡 = √𝛼̅𝑡𝒙0 + √1 − 𝛼̅𝑡𝝐, 𝝐~𝒩(𝟎, 𝑰), 
the posterior expectation in Eq. (8) can be expressed as 
𝝁̃𝑡(𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0) = 𝝁̃𝑡 (𝒙𝑡, 1
√𝛼̅𝑡
(𝒙𝑡 − √1 − 𝛼̅𝑡𝝐))            
= 1
√𝛼𝑡
(𝒙𝑡 − 1 − 𝛼𝑡
√1 − 𝛼̅𝑡
𝝐)                (10) 
Since 𝝁̃𝑡(𝒙𝑡, 𝒙0) can be represented by  𝝐, we can also use a 
neural network model 𝐷𝜃 to predict the noise 𝝐, which has been 
proved to work well by Ho et al. [47]. Hence, the corresponding 
objective can be simplified to 
ℒ = 𝔼𝒙,𝒚𝔼𝝐,𝑡[

]   
(11) 
with 𝑡 uniformly sampled as {1, ⋯ , 𝑇}.  
In this study, the latent space is diffused into Gaussian noise 
using 𝑇 = 1000 steps. A U -Net [55] model 𝐷𝜃  is trained to 
predict the noise 𝜖 in the latent space.  To obtain high -quality 
primary contents, samples can be computed as follows: 
𝒙𝑡−1 =

√𝛼𝑡
(𝒙𝑡 −

√1−𝛼̅𝑡
𝐷𝜃(𝒙𝑡, 𝒚, 𝑡)) + 𝜎𝑡𝒛               (12)  
where 𝒛~𝒩(𝟎, 𝑰). For clarify, the pseudo codes of Algorithms 
1 and 2 are presented for training and inference, respectively.  
Through the emulation of IGM  for active inference using 
conditional DDPM, we successfully obtained the primary 
content. It  is important to note that conditional DDPM is not 
intended to completely restore a distorted image to the reference 
image, but the predicted primary content may present the 
reference image much better than the distorted input. Therefore, 
our goal is to estimate a dissimilarity map from this primary 
content, rather than merely quantifying the disparity between 
the distorted image and its primary content. The process for 
generating this dissimilarity map is depicted in Fig. 2.   
After we obtain the primary cont ent with the conditional 
DDPM, we calculate the SSIM map  between the distorted 
image and the primary content, which assigns values between 0 
and 1  to each and every pixel , with 0 indicating the lowest 
dissimilarity and 1 representing the perfect similarity. As 
dissimilarity indicates the presence of distortion, a critical 
factor in assessing image quality, we subtract the SSIM map  
from an all -one matrix  𝑰 to obtain  the dis similarity weights, 
where larger values signify more severe distortions. Finally, we 
calculate the Hadamard product between the distorted image 
and the dis similarity weights to obtain the dissimilarity map. 
With this dissimilarity map as an input, the subsequent image 
quality evaluat or can m ore effectively leverage the 
characteristics of IGM for BIQA.  We call our method as 
distortion-based BIQA or D-BIQA.

B. Transform-based Quality Evaluator 
After obtaining the dissimilarity map, we integrate it with the 
distorted image, resulting in a multi-channel image (a tensor in 
general). Our primary goal is to create a quality evaluator that 
can effectively process the multi-channel data tensor consisting 
of these input images. To comprehensively utilize information 
with both the spatial and channel dimensions, we introduce a 
transformer-based model tailored for perceptual quality 
prediction based on MANIQA [39].  The overall architecture of 
this transformer-based quality evaluator is depicted in Fig. 3a. 
The core components of the transformer -based quality 
evaluator include: 1) vision transformer; 2) transposed attention 
block; 3) scale Swin transformer block, and 4) patch-weighted 
quality prediction. 
1)  Vision Transformer  
Fig. 3b shows the architecture of ViT. In the context of a given 
multi-channel image, denoted as  𝑬 ∈ ℝ𝐻×𝑊×3, where 𝐻 and 
𝑊 represent the height and width respectively, we employ the 
ViT denoted by 𝑓𝜑  with a learnable vector of parameters 𝜑. 
From the  ViT, we extract features  𝐹𝑖 ∈ ℝ𝑏×𝑐𝑖×𝐻𝑖𝑊𝑖  
corresponding to the i -th layer, where 𝑖 ranges from 1 to 12, 𝑏 
denotes the batch size, 𝑐𝑖  represents channel size, 𝐻𝑖  and 𝑊𝑖 
denote the dimensions of the i -th feature. Specifically, we 
utilize 4 la yers to extract features with varying semantic 
significance. Then, we  concatenate 𝐹̂𝑖 , where 𝑖 ∈ {7,8,9,10}, 
yielding a  composite feature  tensor denoted as 𝐹̃ ∈
ℝ𝑏×∑ 𝑐𝑖𝑖 ×𝐻𝑖𝑊𝑖 . 
2) Transposed Attention Block 
To enhance channel interaction within these concatenated 
features, we employ a transposed attention block.  Unlike the 
conventional spatial attention, this block facilitates self -
attention across channels, effectively computing cross -
covariance between channels to generate an attention map that 
encodes global contextual relations. Beginning with the feature 
tensor 𝐹̃ ∈ ℝ𝑏×∑ 𝑐𝑖𝑖 ×𝐻𝑖𝑊𝑖 , the transposed attention block first 
generates query (Q), key (K) and value (V) projections through 
independent linear projections. These projections are utilized to 
encode pixel -wise cross -channel dependency. The q uery and 
key projections are reshaped for dot-product interaction, 
producing a transposed-attention map A∈ ℝ𝐶̃×𝐶̃. Note that 𝐶̃ is 
equal to 𝑐𝑖 . It is noteworthy that the layer normalization and 
multi-layer perceptron components from the original 

6 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. xx, NO. x, 2020 
 
transformer structure are omitted.  Mathematically, the 
transposed attention block is defined as follows: 
𝑿̂ = 𝑊𝑝𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑛(𝑸̂, 𝑲̂ , 𝑽̂) + 𝑿                       (13) 
Attn(𝑸̂, 𝑲̂, 𝑽̂) = 𝑽̂ ∙ 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑲̂ ∙ 𝑸̂/𝛼)         (14) 
where 𝛼 denotes the spatial dimension of Q, K and V. The 
specifics of the transposed attention block are illustrated in Fig. 
3c. 
3) Scale Swin Transformer Block 
The scale Swin transformer block is shown in Fig. 3d. The 
scale Swin transformer block consists of Swin transformer 
layers and convolutional layers.  Given an input feature 𝐹𝑖,0, the 
scale Swin transformer block first encodes the feature tensor 
through 2 Swin transformer layers: 
𝐹𝑖,𝑗 = 𝐻𝑆𝑇𝐿𝑖,𝑗 (𝐹𝑖,𝑗), 𝑗 = 1,2,                  (15) 
where 𝐻𝑆𝑇𝐿𝑖,𝑗 (∙) represents the j -th Swin transformer layer in 
the i -th stage, 𝑖 ∈ {1,2} . After the encoding  process, a 
convolutional layer is applied before the residual connection.  
The output of the scale Swin transformer block is formulated as 
𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝛼 ∙ 𝐻𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉 (𝐻𝑆𝑇𝐿(𝐹̃𝑖,2)) + 𝐹̃𝑖,0              (16) 
where 𝐻𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉 (∙)  is the convolutional layer , and  𝛼  denotes a 
scale factor for the output of the Swin transformer layer. 
4) Patch-Weighted Quality Prediction 
 A dual -branch structure for patch -weighted quality 
prediction is shown in Fig. 3 e. Given the feature  tensor, we 
generate weight and score projections, which are achieved 
through 2 independent linear projections. The final patch score 
of the distorted image is generated by multiplying the score and 
weight of each patch, then the final score of the whole image is 
generated by the summation of all the final patch scores.  
C. Dataset 
1) DDPM Training Dataset 
For training DDPM, we simulated images with varying levels 
of dosage, by adding realistic noise to the dataset used in the 
2016 low-dose CT grand challenge [56]. With the assumed use 
of a monochromatic source, the projection measurements from 
a CT scan follow the Poisson distribution, which can be 
expressed as 
              𝑛𝑖~𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛{𝑏𝑖𝑒−𝑙𝑖 + 𝑟𝑖},    𝑖 = 1, ⋯ , 𝐼                (17) 
where 𝑛𝑖 is the measurement along the i -th ray path. 𝑏𝑖 are the 
air scan photons, 𝑟𝑖  denotes read -out noise. In Eq. ( 17), the 
noise level can be controlled by 𝑏𝑖. This allowed us to obtain 
three additional noise levels equivalent to 50%, 25% and 10% 
of the normal dose for the 2016 low-dose CT grand challenge 
dataset. Streak artifacts are generated using a similar pipeline to 
noise insertion, but by reconstructing with different numbers of 
projections. There are three different numbers of projection 
views used in our study, which are 720, 360, and 180 views 
equiangularly distributed over a full scan . For each noise level 
we obtain 3 different sparse view, hence we obta ined 12 
reconstructed images for each normal dose scan. We select ed 
1,222 abdomen normal dose images from the 2016 low-dose 
CT grand challenge dataset and simulate d 14,664 images with 
different noise levels and numbers of projection views to train 
our DDPM model. 
2) Low-dose CT BIQA Dataset 
The low -dose CT BIQA dataset comprises a total of 1 ,000 
distorted abdominal images, which exhibit both noise and 
streak artifacts. These images were generated at four different 
dose levels:  100%, 50%, 25%, and 10%. Additionally, three 
numbers of projection views were uniformly selected over a full 
scan, resulting in a total of 12 different types  of image 
degradation. Out of these images, 900 were allocated for the 
training phase, while the r emaining 100 were reserved for the 
testing phase. In this dataset, CT values exceeding 350 
Hounsfield Units (HU) were capped at 350 HU, resulting in a 
CT value range from -1000 HU to 350 HU. These CT values 
were then transformed to a normalized range from 0 to 1. The 
CT image quality assessment was performed using the 
abdominal soft -tissue window, defined by the width/level 
setting of 350/40, and evaluated by five proficient radiologists. 
The ultimate human perceptual score for each image was 
determined by averaging the individual ratings by these

D. Network Training  
For training the DDPM model, we set the total number of time 
steps 𝑇 to 1,000. The model underwent training using the Adam 
optimizer, with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 . The training 
process demonstrated convergence after 5 × 105 iterations on a 
computing server equipped with four Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs. 
Upon completing the training process, we employed the trained 
DDPM to obtain the primary content s from the low -dose CT 
BIQA challenge dataset. Subsequently, we computed the 
dissimilarity map, resulting in a multi-channel image. 
To train the transformer-based quality evaluator, we selected 
the ViT-B/8 model as our pre -trained model. This model was 
initially trained on ImageNet-21k and fine-tuned on ImageNet-
1k, using a patch size of 8. To accommodate the varying input 
sizes of our datasets, we app lied central cropping to resize the 
images to 448×448, as the edges of the images typically 
represent air and have limited influence on the overall image 
quality score. Furthermore, we resized these cropped images to 
a final size of 224×224. Then, we combined a dissimilarity map 
and two duplicated distorted image s to form a three -channel 
image tensor.  
The transformer -based quality evaluator consists of two 
stages, each comprising 2 transposed attention blocks and 1 
scale Swin transformer block. The di mensions of the hidden 
layer, the number of heads, and the window size are set to 768, 
7 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. xx, NO. x, 2020 
 
4, and 4 in each scale Swin transformer block. We set the scale 
parameter to 0.8 in the scale Swin transformer block. For 
training, we established the learning rate at 1 × 10−5 and used 
a batch size of 8. The Adam optimizer was used with a weight 
decay of 1 × 10−5  and cosine annealing for learning rate 
scheduling. The selected loss function was the mean square 
error (MSE) . As our transformer -based quality evaluator was 
built upon the foundation of MANIQA  [39], we still call the 
transformer-based quality assessment method without primary 
content as MANIQA throughout this paper.  Our experiments 
were conducted on an NVIDIA RTX A4000 using PyTorch 
2.0.1 and CUDA 11.8 for both training and testing. 
E. Evaluation Criteria  
We use Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (PLCC), the 
absolute value of the Spearman’s rank order correlation 
coefficient (SROCC), and the Kendall rank -order correlation 
coefficient (KROCC) as the metrics to evaluate the 
performance of our models. The PLCC is defined as  
𝑃𝐿𝐶𝐶 =
∑ (𝑠𝑖 − 𝜇𝑠𝑖 )(𝑠̂𝑖 − 𝜇𝑠̂𝑖 )𝑀
𝑖=1
√∑ (𝑠𝑖 − 𝜇𝑠𝑖 )
2𝑀
𝑖=1 √∑ (𝑠̂𝑖 − 𝜇𝑠̂𝑖)
2𝑀
𝑖=1
        (18) 
where 𝑠𝑖  and 𝑠̂𝑖  respectively indicate the ground -truth and 
predicted quality scores of the i-th image, 𝜇𝑠𝑖  and 𝜇𝑠̂𝑖  indicate 
their means, and  𝑀 denotes the testing images. Le t 𝑑𝑖  denote 
the difference between the ranks of the i-th test image in 
ground-truth and the predicted quality score. The SROCC is 
defined as 
𝑆𝑅𝑂𝐶𝐶 = 1 − 6 ∑ 𝑑𝑖
2𝑀
𝑖=1
𝑀(𝑀2 − 1)                          (19) 
The KROCC is defined as: 
𝐾𝑅𝑂𝐶𝐶 = 2(𝑀𝑐 − 𝑀𝑑)
𝑀(𝑀 − 1)                             (20) 
where 𝑀𝑐 is the count of data pairs sharing the same rank, and 
𝑀𝑑 is the count of data pairs with different rank . We use the 
absolute values of all the metrics, PLCC, SROCC and KROCC, 
are all in the range of  [0, 1]. A higher value indicates better 
performance. The overall metric is defined as 
𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑃𝐿𝐶𝐶 + 𝑆𝑅𝑂𝐶𝐶 + 𝐾𝑅𝑂𝐶𝐶             (21) 
III. RESULTS 
A. Inspection of Primary Contents 
As obtaining high -quality primary content s is of paramount 
importance in mimicking the HVS, our initial focus is on  
evaluating primary content s across various quality scores and 
comparing the outcomes using distinct reconstruction methods. 
We employed the four classic methods for this purpose: 1) FBP: 
Reconstructing the original image from the low-dose CT BIQA 
challenge dataset using FBP; 2) RED-CNN: Utilizing CNN for 
low-dose CT reconstruction; 3) SU-Net: Combining the U-Net 
architecture with the Swi n transformer for low -dose CT 
reconstruction; and 4) DDPM: Known for its powerful image 
generation capabilities in low-dose CT reconstruction. 
 
Figure 4. Visualization of the primary contents produced using different 
reconstructed methods. (a1)–(a3) the input distorted images at different 
distortion levels, of which quality scores are 0.2, 2.0 and 4.0, 
respectively; (b1)–(b3) the primary contents reconstructed by RED -
CNN; (c1)–(c3) the primary contents reconstructed by SU-Net; and (d1)–
(d3) the primary contents reconstructed by DDPM. The display window 
(width/level) is set to 350/40 HU. 
In Fig. 4, we present three representative samples from the 
low-dose CT BIQA challenge dataset, with assigned quality 
scores of 0.2, 2.0, and 4.0  respectively. It can be seen that the 
FBP-reconstructed image with a quality score of 0.2 exhibits 
distortions caused by both noise and streak artifacts. Crucial 
features are not discernible. At a quality score of 2.0, the FBP -
reconstructed image displays noticeable streak artifacts, but the 
main structur al features are  still recognizable. In the FBP  
reconstruction with a quality score of 4.0, the anatomical 
structure is highly visible, qualified as a reference image. The 
RED-CNN method successfully mitigates noise artifacts but 
sometimes amplifies streak artifacts. This effect is particularly 
pronounced in the image with a quality score of 0.2, exerting a 
negative impact on image quality. SU -Net effectively 
suppresses both noise and streak artifacts. However, the  

8 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. xx, NO. x, 2020 
 
resultant image a ppears overly smooth, deviating from the 
authentic appearance of the real clinical counterpart. The 
DDPM approach emerges as a n accurate yet  robust solution, 
effectively suppressing noise and streak artifacts while 
simultaneously preserving intricate detai ls. Furthermore, the 
distribution of the images closely aligns with that of real clinical 
reference images. As a result, opting for DDPM to generate 
high-quality primary content s proves feasible  and 
advantageous, facilitating an accurate emulation of the I GM 
principle within the HVS.  
B. Visualization of the Prior Information 
By employing primary contents generated through DDPM, 
we can glean insights into the proposed method. In Fig. 5, the 
first row showcases distorted images across varying levels of 
distortions. From the second to the last row, we present 
corresponding primary contents and dissimilarity maps. The 
effectiveness of the IGM becomes evident in its ability to 
mitigate noise and infer high -quality primary content, as 
evidenced in Fig. 5(d)-(f). Con currently, as depicted in Fig. 
5(g)-(i), when subjected to distinct levels of artifacts, the 
dissimilarity map exhibits diverse patterns. Notably, Fig. 5(i) 
demonstrates lower dissimilarity, implying less content 
degradation in Fig. 5(c).

distorted images at different distortion levels, with image quality scores 
of 0.2, 2.0 and 4.0 respectively. The lower the quality score, the higher 
the distortion level and the worse the per ceptual quality ; (d)–(f) the 
primary contents generated by DDPM; and (g)–(i) the dissimilarity maps

dataset. From left to right are the distorted images, the weight maps, and 
scores. From top to bottom are five representative example images with 
the radiologist score s of 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0  and our model 
predictions respectively. 
C. Visualization of Exemplary Images 
In Fig. 6, we visualize distorted images and weight maps for 
five represetative examples from the low-dose CT BIQA test 
dataset. These weight maps clearly highlight salient subjects, 
which are s ignificant areas that strongly influence human 
perception. When humans view an image, features of interest 
greatly affects our perception, and therefore these features 
receive higher weights as depicted in Fig. 6. Furthermore, as the 
score increases, the weight also becomes larger. Regarding the 
predicted scores for the images, we observed some bias relative 
to the radiologists’ scores, indicating that there is still room for 
improvement. 
D. Performance Comparison within the Low-dose CT 
BIQA Challenge Dataset 
Given the absence of reference images in the dataset, we 
straightforwardly partition the dataset based on distorted 
images. We compared our method against one traditional BIQA 
method and two CNN -based methods, along with one 
transformer-based method. For t he traditional approach, we 
selected the natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) as a 
representative method  as implemented in the official code . 

9 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, VOL. xx, NO. x, 2020 
 
Among the CNN-based methods, we used DBCNN and Hyper-
IQA as representative networks, using the implementations 
provided in [56]. As for the transformer -based method, we 
employed MANIQA. Referring to Table II , limited by the 
handcrafted features, the traditional NIQE demonstrates the 
lowest performance. The CNN -based methods show 
remarkable improvements over the NIQE  approach. Between 
these two CNN-based methods, DBCNN outperforms in PLCC 
and KROCC metrics, while Hyper-IQA excels in SROCC. The 
performance of these two CNN -based methods is closely 
comparable. As a representative of transformer-based methods, 
MANIQA exhibits superior performance over the CNN-based 
methods. Remarkably, our proposed D-BIQA method achieves 
the highest performance. In summary, D -BIQA demonstrates 
strong efficacy on the low-dose CT BIQA challenge dataset, 
thereby affirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

IV DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION 
Given the widespread artifacts in low -dose CT images, we 
have opted for a transformer -based approach to comprehen d 
these artifacts globally. It is worth emphasizing the importance 
of pretraining when utilizing transformers. In this study, we 
have chosen to use a pretrained ViT-B/8 model with a 224×224 
configuration for further training on a low -dose CT dataset. In 
typical natural image BIQA, researchers often employ a random 
crop of 224 ×224 to align with the requirement for training a 
transformer. However, in the case of CT images, the peripheral 
region of the image predominantly correspond s to air and 
should not influence the quality assessment. As a result, we 
have cropped each original 512 × 512 images down to a 
centralized 448 × 448 image, excluding the air and less 
important features from consideration. To ensure the quality of 
neural network training while simultaneously minimizing 
computational com plexity, we have employed a common 
down-sampling technique [57]. Specifically, all images were 
consistently down-sampled to a uniform size of 224×224. This 
enables us to effectively address the globalized artifacts in low-
dose CT images while losing little information in  this medical 
imaging domain.  
Directional artifacts in low-dose CT images can occasionally 
mislead radiologists because they might resemble actual 
anatomical structures. To address this issue, we have 
implemented a DDPM to mitigate th ese artifacts. While the 
DDPM has demonstrated the capability to generate high-quality 
images that closely resemble reality, it  is important to clarify 
that our intention is not to restore a perfectly pristine or 
distortion-free image. Our DDPM  efforts may  still retain 
compromised information when dealing with severely distorted 
images. Nevertheless, our primary objective is to emulate the 
active inference process employed by IGM to predict the vital 
content within the image. As long as the DDPM results are  
helpful to derive the primary content  and guide our image 
quality assessment, our goal is achieved. 
In conclusion, w e have introduced a novel D-BIQA model 
for image quality assessment based on DDPM -driven active 
inference. Leveraging the amazing image synthesis capability 
of DDPM, our active inference module seems adeptly 
emulating the IGM theory to forecast the primary contents from 
distorted images. Through the amalgamation of information 
derived from distorted images and dissimilarity maps, a multi-
channel image  tensor is formed and fed into a transformer -
based quality evaluator. A comprehensive set of experiments 
substantiates the efficacy and superiority of our proposed 
approach. While we achieved the second place in the MICCAI 
2023 low-dose CT perceptual image quality assessment grand 
challenge with our reported transformer -based quality 
evaluator, this much -improved approach for D -BIQA has 
further enhanced performance guided by the IGM theory, which 
is the main innovation of this work.
