Preface
Karl Friston
Active Inference is a way of understanding sentient be hav ior. The very
fact that you are reading these lines means that you are engaging in Active
Inference— namely, actively sampling the world—in a par tic u lar way—
because you believe you w ill learn something. You are palpating this page
with your eyes simply b ecause this is the kind of action that w ill resolve uncer-
tainty about what you w ill see next and—i ndeed—w hat t hese words convey.
In short, Active Inference puts the action into perception, whereby perception
is treated as perceptual inference or hypothesis testing. Active Inference goes
even further and considers planning as inference—t hat is, inferring what you
would do next to resolve uncertainty about your lived world.
To illustrate the simplicity of Active Inference—a nd what we are try-
ing to explain—p lace your fingertips g ently on your leg. Keep them t here
motionless for a second or two. Now, does your leg feel rough or smooth?
If you had to move your fing ers to evince a feeling of roughness or smooth-
ness, you have discovered a fundament of Active Inference. To feel is to
palpate. To see is to look. To hear is to listen. This palpation does not neces-
sarily have to be overt—we can act covertly by directing our attention to
this or that. In short, we are not simply trying to make sense of our sensa-
tions; we have to actively create our sensorium. In what follows, we w ill
see why this has to be the case and why everyt hing that we perceive, do, or
plan is in the compass of one existential imperative—s elf-e videncing.
Active Inference is not just about reading or epistemic foraging. It is, on
one view, something that all creatures and particles do, in virtue of their
existence. This might sound like a strong claim; however, it speaks to the
fact that Active Inference inherits from a f ree energy princip le that equates
existence with self-e videncing and self-e videncing with an enactive sort of

inference. However, this book is not concerned with the physics of sentient
systems. Its focus is on the implications of this physics for understanding
how the brain works.
This understanding is not an easy business, as witnessed by millennia of
natur al philosophy and centuries of neuroscience. Although one can find
the roots of Active Inference in first princi ple accounts of self- organized
beh avi or (i.e., variational princip les akin to Hamilton’s princip le of stationary
action), first princip les do not help very much when asking how a part icu l ar
brain works and how it differs from another brain. For example, committing
to the theory of evolution by natur al sel ection does not help in the slightest
when it comes to understanding why I have two eyes or speak French. This
book is about using princip les to scaffold key questions in neuroscience and
artificial intelligence. To do this, we have to move beyond princip les and get
to grips with the mechanics to which the princip les apply.
As such, Active Inference—a nd its accompanying Bayesian mechanics—
is there to frame questions about how we perceive, plan, and act. Crucially,
it does not aim to replace other frameworks, such as behavioral psyc holo gy,
decision theory, and reinforcement learning. Rather, it hopes to embrace
all t hose approaches that have proven so successful within a unified frame-
work. In what follows, we w ill pay special attention to linking key con-
structs from psyc holo gy, cognitive neuroscience, enactivism, ethology, and
so on to the calculus of belief updating in Active Inference—a nd its associ-
ated proc ess theories.
By pro cess theories, we refer to theories about how belief updating is real-
ized by neuronal (and other biophysical) proc esses in the embodied brain
and beyond. Work to date in Active Inference offers a fairly straightforward
set of computational architectures and simulation tools to both model vari-
ous aspects of a functioning brain and enable people to test hypotheses
about diff ere nt computational architectures. However, t hese tools only solve
half the probl em. At the heart of Active Inference lies a generative model—
namely, a probabilistic repre sen ta tion of how unobservable causes in the
world out there generate the observable consequences— our sensations.
Getting the generative model right—as an apt explanation for the sentient
be hav ior of any experimental subject or creature—is the big challenge.
This book tries to explain how to meet this challenge. The first part sets
up the basic ideas and formalisms that are called on in the second part—to
illustrate how they can be applied in practice. In short, this book is for

people who want to use Active Inference to simulate and model sentient
beh avi or, in the ser vice of e ither scientific inquiry or, possibly, artificial
intelligence. Thus it focuses on t hose ideas and procedures that are nec-
essary to understand and implement an Active Inference scheme without
getting distracted by the physics of sentient systems on the one hand or
philosophy on the other.
A Note from Karl Friston
I have a confession to make. I did not write much of this book. Or, more
precisely, I was not allowed to. This book’s agenda calls for a crisp and clear
writing style that is beyond me. Although I was allowed to slip in a few of
my favorite words, what follows is a testament to Thomas and Giovanni,
their deep understanding of the issues at hand, and, importantly, their
theory of mind—in all senses.
