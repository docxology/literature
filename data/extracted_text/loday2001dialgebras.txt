DIALGEBRAS
Jean-Louis LODAY
There is a notion of “non-commutative Lie algebra” called Leibniz algebra,
which is characterized by the following property. The brack eting [ −,z] is a
derivation for the bracket operation, that is, it satisﬁes t he Leibniz identity:
[[x,y],z] = [[ x,z],y] + [ x,[y,z]].
cf. [L1]. When it happens that the bracket is skew-symmetric , we get a Lie
algebra since the Leibniz identity becomes equivalent to th e Jacobi identity.
Any associative algebra gives rise to a Lie algebra by [ x,y] = xy− yx.
The purpose of this article is to introduce and study a new not ion of algebra
which gives, by a similar procedure, a Leibniz algebra. The i dea is to start
with two distinct operations for the product xy and the product yx, so that
the bracket is not necessarily skew-symmetric any more. Exp licitly, we deﬁne
an associative dialgebra (or simply dialgebra for short) as a vector space D
equipped with two associative operations ⊣ and ⊢, called respectively left and
right product, satisfying 3 more axioms:





x⊣ (y⊣ z) = x⊣ (y⊢ z),
(x⊢ y) ⊣ z= x⊢ (y⊣ z),
(x⊣ y) ⊢ z= ( x⊢ y) ⊢ z.
It is immediate to check that [ x,y] := x⊣ y− y⊢ x deﬁnes a Leibniz bracket.
Hence any dialgebra gives rise to a Leibniz algebra.
A typical example of dialgebra is constructed as follows. Le t ( A,d) be a
diﬀerential associative algebra, and put
x⊣ y:= x dy and x⊢ y:= dx y.
One easily checks that ( A,⊣,⊢) is a dialgebra. For instance there is a natural
dialgebra structure on the de Rham complex of a manifold.
Observe that, since the relations deﬁning a dialgebra do not involve sums,
there is a well-deﬁned notion of dimonoid.
In this article we construct and study a (co)homology theory for dialgebras.
Since an associative algebra is a particular case of dialgeb ra, we get a new
(co)homology theory for associative algebras as well. The s urprizing fact, in
the construction of the chain complex, is the appearance of t he combinatorics
of planar binary trees . The principal result about this homology theory HY
is its vanishing on free dialgebras. In order to state some of the properties of
the theory HY, we introduce another type of algebras with two operations:
1
the dendriform algebras (sometimes called dendriform dialgebras). This notion
dichotomizes the notion of associative algebra in the follo wing sense: there are
two operations ≺ and ≻, such that the product ∗ made of the sum of them
x∗ y:= x≺ y+ x≻ y,
is associative. The axioms relating these two products are
(i) ( a≺ b) ≺ c= a≺ (b≺ c) + a≺ (b≻ c),
(ii) ( a≻ b) ≺ c= a≻ (b≺ c),
(iii) ( a≺ b) ≻ c+ (a≻ b) ≻ c= a≻ (b≻ c).
The free dendriform algebra can be constructed by means of th e planar binary
trees, whence the terminology.
The results intertwining associative dialgebras and dendr iform algebras are
best expressed in the framework of algebraic operads. The notion of dialgebra
deﬁnes an algebraic operad Dias, which is binary and quadratic. By the theory
of Ginzburg and Kapranov (cf. [GK]), there is a well-deﬁned “ dual operad”
Dias!. We show that this is precisely the operad Dend of the “dendriform
algebras”, in other words a dual associative dialgebra is no thing but a dendri-
form algebra. The vanishing of HY of a free dialgebra implies that those two
operads are of a special kind: they are “Koszul operads”. As a consequence
the cohomology of a dialgebra is a graded dendriform algebra and, a fortiori,
a graded associative algebra. The explicit description of t he free dendriform
algebra in terms of trees permits us to describe the notion of strong homotopy
associative dialgebra .
The categories of algebras over these operads assemble into a commutative
diagram of functors which reﬂects the Koszul duality.

This paper is part of a long-standing project whose ultimate aim is to study
periodicity phenomenons in algebraic K-theory. This project is described in
2
[L4]. The next step would consist in computing the dialgebra homology of the
augmentation ideal of K[GL(A)], for an associative algebra A.
Here is the content of this article. In the ﬁrst section we int roduce the
notion of associative dimonoid, or dimonoid for short, and d evelop the calculus
in a dimonoid. In particular we describe the free dimonoid on a given set.
In the second section we introduce the notion of dialgebra an d give several
examples. We explicitly describe the free dialgebra over a v ector space. In the
third section we construct the chain complex of a dialgebra D, which gives rise
to homology and cohomology groups denoted HY(D). The main tool is made
of the planar binary trees and operations on them. We prove th at HY of a
free dialgebra vanishes (hence the operad associated to dia lgebras is a Koszul
operad). We also introduce a variation of the chain complex b y replacing the
trees by increasing trees, or, equivalently, by permutatio ns. This variation
appears naturally in the computation of the Leibniz homolog y of dialgebras of
matrices (cf. [F1]). (Co)homology of dialgebras with non-t rivial coeﬃcients is
treated by Alessandra Frabetti in [F4].
Section 4 is devoted to the relationship between Leibniz alg ebras and di-
algebras. The functor which assigns to any dialgebra ( D,⊢,⊣) the Leibniz
algebra ( D,[x,y] := x ⊣ y− y ⊢ x) has a left adjoint which is the universal
enveloping dialgebra of a Leibniz algebra. Then we compare the diverse types
of free algebras and we propose a deﬁnition for a Poisson dialgebra . The Hopf-
type properties of the universal enveloping dialgebra are s tudied by Fran¸ cois
Goichot in [Go].
In the ﬁfth section we introduce the notion of dendriform algebra , which is
closely connected to the notion of associative dialgebra. F or instance the tensor
product of a dialgebra and of a dendriform algebra is natural ly equipped with a
structure of Lie algebra. The main result of this section is t o make explicit the
free dendriform algebra. It turns out that it is best express ed in terms of planar
binary trees. The dendriform algebra structure on the vecto r space generated
by the planar binary trees is the core of this section. It uses the grafting
operation and the nesting operation on trees and it induces a graded associative
algebra structure on the same vector space. In a sense associ ative algebras are
closely connected with the integers (including addition an d multiplication).
Similarly dendriform algebras are closely connected with p lanar binary trees
and a calculus on them. This arithmetic aspect of the theory w ill be treated
elsewhere.
In section 6 we construct (co)homology groups for dendrifor m algebras.
They vanish on free dendriform algebras.
In section 7 we relate dendriform algebras with Zinbiel alge bras (i.e. dual-
Leibniz algebras) and associative algebras. It is based on t he relationship be-
tween binary trees and permutations as described in Appendi x A.
The aim of the eighth section is to interpret the preceding re sults in the
context of algebraic operads. The basics on algebraic opera ds and Koszul
duality are recalled in Appendix B. We show that the operads a ssociated to
3
dialgebras and to dendriform algebras are dual in the operad sense. Then we
show that the (co)homology groups HY for dialgebras (resp. HDend for den-
driform algebras) constructed in section 3 (resp. 4) are the ones predicted by
the operad theory. Hence, by the vanishing of HY of a free dialgebra, both op-
erads Dias and Dend are Koszul. It implies, among several consequences, the
vanishing of the homology of a free dendriform algebra. Some of the theorems
in sections 2 to 6 can be proved either directly or by appealin g to the operad
theory. In general we write down the most elementary one.
The last section describes the notion of strong homotopy associative dial-
gebras. For any Koszul operad the notion of algebra up to homotopy is theo-
retically well-deﬁned from the bar construction over the du al operad. Since, in
our case, we know explicitly the structure of a free dendrifo rm algebra, we can
make the notion of dialgebra up to homotopy completely expli cit.
Part of the results of this article has been announced in a “No te aux
Comptes Rendus” [L2]. I thank Ale Frabetti, Benoit Fresse, V ictor Gnedbaye,

1. DIMONOIDS
1.1. Deﬁnition. An associative dimonoid , or dimonoid for short, is a set X
equipped with two maps called respectively left product and right product :
⊣ : X× X→ X,(left)
⊢ : X× X→ X,(right)
satisfying the following axioms





x⊣ (y⊣ z)
1
= ( x⊣ y) ⊣ z
2
= x⊣ (y⊢ z),
(x⊢ y) ⊣ z
3
= x⊢ (y⊣ z),
(x⊣ y) ⊢ z
4
= x⊢ (y⊢ z)
5
= ( x⊢ y) ⊢ z,
for all x,y and z ∈ X.
In the notation x ⊣ y, y ⊢ x, the element x is said to be on the pointer
side and the element y is said to be on the bar side.
The numbers 1 to 5 of the relations are for future reference.
Observe that relations 1 and 5 are the “associativity” of the products ⊣
and ⊢ respectively. Relation 3 will be referred to as “inside asso ciativity”, since
the products point inside. Relations 2 and 4 can be replaced b y the relations
12 and 45:
x⊣ (y⊣ z)
12
= x⊣ (y⊢ z) and ( x⊣ y) ⊢ z
45
= ( x⊢ y) ⊢ z,
which can be summarized as “on the bar side, does not matter wh ich product”.
All these relations are referred to as “diassociativity”.
A morphism of dimonoids is a map f : X→ Y between two dimonoids X
and Y such that f(x ⊣ x′) = f(x) ⊣ f(x′) and f(x ⊢ x′) = f(x) ⊢ f(x′) for
any x,x′ ∈ X.
Observe that one can deﬁne a di-object in any monoidal catego ry. One
does not need the monoidal category to be symmetric since in e ach relation the
variables stay in the same order.
1.2. Bar-unit. An element e∈ X is said to be a bar-unit of the dimonoid X
if
x⊣ e= x= e⊢ x, for any x∈ X.
So it is only assumed that eacts trivially from the bar side. There is no reason
for a bar-unit to be unique. The set of bar-units is called the halo.
A morphism of dimonoids is said to be unital if the image of a bar-unit is
a bar-unit.
1.3. Examples.
a) Let M be a monoid (without unit), that is a set M with an associative
product ( m,m′) ↦→mm′. Putting m⊣ m′ = mm′ = m⊢ m′ gives a dimonoid
6
structure on M. Indeed each relation 1 to 5 is the associativity property. A
unit of the monoid is a bar-unit of the associated dimonoid.
Conversely, if in a dimonoid D there is a unit, that is an element 1 ∈ D
which satisﬁes either 1 ⊣ x= xor x= x⊢ 1 for all x∈ D, then, by axiom 3 or
5, one has ⊣ = ⊢ and D is simply the dimonoid associated to a unital monoid.
b) Let X be a set and deﬁne
x⊣ y= x= y⊢ x, for any x,y ∈ X.
Then, obviously, X is a (not so interesting) dimonoid and it coincides with its
halo.
c) Let M be a monoid. Put D= M × M and deﬁne the products by
{
(m,n) ⊣ (m′,n′) := ( m,nm′n′)
(m,n) ⊢ (m′,n′) := ( mnm′,n′).
With these deﬁnitions D= ( D,⊣,⊢) is a dimonoid. Let us check relation 3 for
instance:
((m,n) ⊢ (m′,n′)) ⊣ (m′′,n′′) = ( mnm′,n′) ⊣ (m′′,n′′) = ( mnm′,n′m′′n′′)
(m,n) ⊢ ((m′,n′) ⊣ (m′′,n′′)) = ( m,n) ⊢ (m′,n′m′′n′′) = ( mnm′,n′m′′n′′).
Let 1 ∈ M be a unit for M. Then e = (1 ,1) is a bar-unit for D, but one has
e ⊣ x ̸= x and x ⊢ e ̸= x in D in general. For any invertible element m the
element ( m,m−1) ∈ D is a bar-unit.
d) Let G be a group and X a G-set. The following formulas deﬁne a
dimonoid structure on X× G (cf. 7.5):
{
(x,g) ⊣(y,h) := ( x,gh),
(x,g) ⊢(y,h) := ( g· y,gh).
1.4. Opposite dimonoid. Let D be a dimonoid. Deﬁne new operations ⊣′
and ⊢′ on D by
x⊣′ y:= y⊢ x,
x⊢′ y:= y⊣ x.
It is immediate to check that ( D,⊣′,⊢′) is a new dimonoid which we call the
opposite dimonoid that we denote by Dop.
Observe that if we put
{ x⊣′′ y:= y⊣ x,
x⊢′′ y:= y⊢ x,
then ( D,⊢′′,⊣′′) is not a dimonoid.
7
1.5. Monomials in a dimonoid. Let x1,...,x n be elements in the dimonoid
D. A monomial in D is a parenthesizing together with product signs, for
instance
((x1 ⊣ x2) ⊢ (x3 ⊣ x4)) ⊣ (x5 ⊢ x6),
giving rise to an element in D. Such a monomial is completely determined by
a binary tree, where each vertex is labelled by ⊣ or ⊢:

1.6. The middle of a monomial. Given a monomial as above we deﬁne
the middle of the monomial as being the entry xi determined by the following
algorithm. Starting at the root of the tree one goes up by choo sing the route
indicated by the pointer. The middle of the monomial is the ab utment of the
path. In this example x3 is the middle.

1.7. Theorem (Dimonoid calculus). Let xi, i ∈ Z, be elements in a
dimonoid D.
a) Any parenthesizing of
x−n ⊢ x−n+1 ⊢ ... ⊢ x−1 ⊢ x0 ⊣ x1 ⊣ ... ⊣ xm−1 ⊣ xm
gives the same element in D, which we denote by
x−n...x −1 ˇx0x1 ...x m.
b) Let m= x1 ...x k be a monomial in D. Let xi be its middle entry. Then
m= x1 ... ˇxi...x k.
8
c) One has the following formulas in D:
(x1 ... ˇxi...x k) ⊣ (xk+1 ... ˇxj...x ℓ) = x1 ... ˇxi...x kxk+1 ...x j...x ℓ
(x1 ... ˇxi...x k) ⊢ (xk+1 ... ˇxj...x ℓ) = x1 ...x i...x kxk+1 ... ˇxj...x ℓ.
For instance, in the above example, one has
((x1 ⊣ x2) ⊢ (x3 ⊣ x4)) ⊣ (x5 ⊢ x6) = x1x2 ˇx3x4x5x6.
Proof. By axiom 1 (associativity of ⊣) any parenthesizing of x1 ⊣ ... ⊣ xm
gives the same element. So, in such a monomial we can ignore th e parentheses
(and analogously for ⊢ thanks to axiom 5).
Consider a generic monomial with ﬁrst entry x−n, last entry xm and middle
entry x0 (where −n≤ 0 ≤ m). By axioms 1 − 3 − 5 it is clear that the element
(∗) ( x−n ⊢ ... ⊢ x−1) ⊢ x0 ⊣ (x1 ⊣ ... ⊣ xm)
is well-deﬁned. We denote it by x−n... ˇx0 ...x m.
Consider the labelled tree of our generic monomial. Let v be a vertex
which is on the route from the root to the middle entry x0. Thanks to axioms
12 and 45 all the vertices on the bar side of v can be labelled with the same
label as v. In our example

This new tree corresponds to a monomial of the form ( ∗) and therefore we
have proved that our starting monomial has value x−n... ˇx0 ...x m. So parts
a) and b) are proved.

By a) and b) it follows that in order to compute
(x1 ... ˇxi...x k) ⊣ (xk+1 ... ˇxj...x ℓ) and ( x1 ... ˇxi...x k) ⊢ (xk+1 ... ˇxj...x ℓ)
it suﬃces to determine which entry is the middle of these mono mials. By the

2. ASSOCIATIVE DIALGEBRAS
In the sequel K denotes a ﬁeld referred to as the ground ﬁeld . Later on
it will be supposed to be of characteristic zero. The tensor p roduct over K is
denoted by ⊗K or, more often, by ⊗.
After introducing the notion of dialgebra, we give some exam ples, including
free dialgebras, which we describe explicitly, and deﬁne mo dules and represen-
tations over a dialgebra.
2.1. Deﬁnition. An associative dialgebra , or dialgebra for short, over K is a
K-module D equipped with two K-linear maps
⊣ : D⊗ D− →D,
⊢ : D⊗ D− →D,
satisfying the di-associativity axioms









(1) ( x⊣ y) ⊣ z = x⊣ (y⊢ z),
(2) ( x⊣ y) ⊣ z = x⊣ (y⊣ z),
(3) ( x⊢ y) ⊣ z = x⊢ (y⊣ z),
(4) ( x⊣ y) ⊢ z = x⊢ (y⊢ z),
(5) ( x⊢ y) ⊢ z = x⊢ (y⊢ z).
The maps ⊣ and ⊢ are called respectively the left product and the right product.
Here is an equivalent formulation of these axioms: the produ cts ⊣ and ⊢
are associative and satisfy:





(12) x⊣ (y⊣ z) = x⊣ (y⊢ z),
(3) ( x⊢ y) ⊣ z= x⊢ (y⊣ z),
(45) ( x⊣ y) ⊢ z= ( x⊢ y) ⊢ z.
Observe that the analogue of formula (3), but with the produc t symbols point-
ing outward, is not valid in general: ( x⊣ y) ⊢ z̸= x⊣ (y⊢ z).
A morphism of dialgebras from Dto D′ is a K-linear map f : D→ D′ such
that
f(x⊣ y) = f(x) ⊣ f(y) and f(x⊢ y) = f(x) ⊢ f(y) for all x,y ∈ D.
We denote by Dias the category of dialgebras.
A bar-unit in D is an element e∈ D such that
x⊣ e= x= e⊢ x for all x∈ D.
A bar-unit need not be unique. The subset of bar-units of D is called its halo.
A unital dialgebra is a dialgebra with a speciﬁed bar-unit e. This choice
gives rise to a preferred K-linear map֒→D,λ ↦→λe.
11
A morphism of dialgebras is said to be unital if the image of any bar-unit
is a bar-unit.
Observe that if a dialgebra has a unit ǫ, that is an element which satisﬁes
ǫ⊣ x= x for any x, then ⊣ = ⊢ by axiom 12, and D is an associative algebra
with unit.
An ideal I in a dialgebra Dis a submodule of Dsuch that x⊣ y and x⊢ y
are in I whenever one of the variables is in I. Clearly the quotient D/I is a
dialgebra. Conversely, the kernel of a dialgebra morphism i s an ideal.
2.2. Examples.
a) Associative algebra. If A is an associative algebra over K, then the
formulas a⊣ b= ab= a⊢ b deﬁne a structure of dialgebra on A. If 1 is a unit
of the associative algebra, then e= 1 is a unit of the dialgebra and the halo is
just {1}.
b) Diﬀerential associative algebra. Let ( A,d) be a diﬀerential associative
algebra. So, by hypothesis, d(ab) = dab+adb (here we work in the non-graded
setting) and d2 = 0. Deﬁne left and right products on A by the formulas
x⊣ y:= x dy and x⊢ y:= dx y.
It is immediate to check that Aequipped with these two products is a dialgebra.
A similar construction holds in the graded (or more accurate ly super) algebra
framework.
c) Dimonoid algebra. Let X be a dimonoid, and denote by K[X] the free
K-module on X. Then obviously K[X] is a dialgebra.
d) Bimodule map. Let A be an associative algebra and let M be an A-
bimodule. Let f : M→ Abe an A-bimodule map. Then one can put a dialgebra
structure on M as follows:
m⊣ m′ := mf(m′),
m⊢ m′ := f(m)m′,
The veriﬁcation is left to the reader. One can systematize th is procedure by
considering the tensor category of linear maps as follows (c f. [LP2], [Ku] for
details). The category of linear maps over K is made of the K-linear maps
f : V → W as objects. It can be equipped with a tensor product by
(V
f
→W) ⊗ (V′ f′
→W′) = V ⊗ W′ ⊕ W ⊗ V′ f⊗1+1⊗f′
− → W ⊗ W′.
An associative algebra in this tensor category deﬁnes a dial gebra structure on
the source object.
The particular case of the projection M ⊕ A → A shows that there is a
dialgebra structure on M ⊕ A (cf. P. Higgins [Hi]).
e) Tensor product, matrices. If D and D′ are two dialgebras, then the
tensor product D⊗D′ is also a dialgebra by ( a⊗a′)⋆(b⊗b′) = ( a⋆b)⊗(a′ ⋆b′) for
12
⋆=⊣ and ⊢. For instance the module of n×n−matrices Mn(D) = Mn(K)⊗D
is a dialgebra. The left and right products are given by
(α⊣ β)ij =
∑
k
αik ⊣ βkj and ( α⊢ β)ij =
∑
k
αik ⊢ βkj.
f) Opposite dialgebra . As for dimonoids, the opposite dialgebra of Dis the
dialgebra Dop with the same underlying K-module and with products given by
x⊣′ y= y⊢ x, x⊢′ y= y⊣ x.
g) Let A be an associative algebra over K. Put D= A⊗ A and deﬁne
a⊗ b⊣ a′ ⊗ b′ := a⊗ ba′b′,
a⊗ b⊢ a′ ⊗ b′ := aba′ ⊗ b′.
Extending these formulas by linearity on A⊗Agives well-deﬁned product maps
⊣ and ⊢ on D which satisfy the diassociativity axioms. If 1 ∈ Ais a unit of the
associative algebra, then 1 ⊗ 1 is a bar-unit for the dialgebra. More generally,
for any invertible element x in A, the element x⊗ x−1 is a bar-unit. If I is a
left ideal and J is a right ideal, then the same formulas deﬁne a diassociativ e
algebra structure on I⊗K J.
h) Let A be an associative algebra and n be a positive integer. On the
module of n-vectors D= An one puts:
(x⊣ y)i = xi
( n∑
j=1
yj
)
for 1 ≤ i≤ n and
(x⊢ y)i =
( n∑
j=1
xj
)
yi for 1 ≤ i≤ n.
One easily checks that D is a dialgebra. For n= 1, this is example (a). In fact
this construction can be extended to any dialgebra A.
2.3. Module, bimodule, extension. A left module over a dialgebra D is a
K-module M equipped with two linear maps
⊣ : D⊗ M→ M,(right structure)
⊢ : D⊗ M→ M,(left structure)
satisfying the axioms (1)-(5) whenever they make sense. The re is, of course, a
similar deﬁnition for right modules.
A bimodule over a dialgebra D, also called a representation, is a K-module
M equipped with four linear maps
⊣,⊢ : M ⊗ D→ M,(right structures)
⊣,⊢ : D⊗ M→ M,(left structures)
13
satisfying the axioms (1) to (5), whenever one of the entries x,y or z is in M
and the two others are in D.
Obviously a bimodule over D is, a fortiori, a left module and also a right
module over D ; and D is a bimodule over itself.
Let
0 → M → D→ D→ 0
be an abelian extension of dialgebras, that is an exact seque nce of dialgebras
such that any product of two elements in M is trivial. Then, it is immediate
to check that M is a representation of D in the above sense.
2.4. Free associative dialgebra. Let V be a K-module. By deﬁnition the
free dialgebra on V is the dialgebra Dias(V) equipped with a K-linear map
i : V → Dias(V) such that for any K-module map f : V → D, where D is a
dialgebra over K, there is a unique factorization
f : V
i
− →Dias(V)
φ
− →D,
where φ is a dialgebra morphism.
Equivalently the functor Dias : ( K− Mod) → Dias is left adjoint to the
forgetful functor. The following proposition proves the ex istence of the free
dialgebra Dias(V) and gives an explicit description of it in terms of the tenso r
module
T(V) := K⊕ V ⊕ V⊗2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V⊗n ⊕ · · · .
2.5. Theorem. The free dialgebra on V is the K-module
Dias(V) = T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V)
equipped with the two products induced by:
(v−n· · · v−1 ⊗ v0 ⊗ v1 · · · vm) ⊣ (w−p· · · w−1 ⊗ w0 ⊗ w1 · · · wq)
= v−n· · · v−1 ⊗ v0 ⊗ v1 · · · vmw−p· · · wq,
(v−n· · · v−1 ⊗ v0 ⊗ v1 · · · vm) ⊢ (w−p· · · w−1 ⊗ w0 ⊗ w1 · · · wq)
= v−n· · · vmw−p· · · w−1 ⊗ w0 ⊗ w1 · · · wq,
where vi, wj ∈ V.
With our notation (cf. 1.7) any additive generator of Dias(V) can be
written
v−n· · · v−1 ⊗ v0 ⊗ v1 · · · vm = v−n· · · v−1 ˇv0v1 · · · vm.
Proof. It is immediate to check that Dias(V) = ( T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V),⊣,⊢)
is a dialgebra (cf. 1.7). The map i : V → Dias(V) is the composite V ≃
1 · K ⊗ V ⊗ 1 ·֒→T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V). Starting with f : V → D the map
φ: Dias(V) → D is given by
φ(v−n· · · v−1 ˇv0v1 · · · vm) = f(v−n) · · · f(v−1)f(v0)ˇf(v1) · · · f(vm).
14
It is obviously a dialgebra morphism. Moreover, by theorem 1 .7, it is uniquely
determined since it should coincide with f on V ∼
= 1·K⊗V⊗1·Kand it should
be a morphism of dialgebras. Hence the inclusion V → Dias(V) is universal.Remark. A free dialgebra is a particular case of example 2.2.d, with M =
T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V) , A= T(V) (the associative tensor algebra) and f : M → A
being the concatenation.
Let V be ﬁnite dimensional over Kgenerated by x1,· · · ,xn. Let us describe
the degree npart of T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V) which is generated by all the monomials
containing xi once and only once, 1 ≤ i≤ n. We denote it by Dias(n). These
monomials are the elements
(σ,i)(x1,· · · ,xn) := xσ−1(1) · · · ˇxσ−1(i) · · · xσ−1(n), σ ∈ Sn, 1 ≤ i≤ n,
where Sn is the symmetric group. Therefore, as a left Sn-module, the multi-
linear part of this space is isomorphic to ncopies of the regular representation
of Sn:
Dias(n) ∼
= nK[Sn].
The element σ in the i-th copy corresponds to the operation ( σ,i) described
above (cf. Corollary 1.8).
Examples:
• n= 1 , one generator: ˇx1.
• n= 2 , four generators: ˇx1x2,ˇx2x1,x1 ˇx2,x2 ˇx1.
• n= 3 , eighteen generators: ˇxixjxk,xiˇxjxk,xixjˇxk
for all permutations i,j,k of 1,2,3.
2.6. Associative algebra associated to a dialgebra. For any dialgebra D
let DAs be the quotient of Dby the ideal generated by the elements x⊣ y−x⊢ y,
for all x,y ∈ D. It is clear that ⊣ = ⊢ in DAs, hence DAs is an associative alge-
bra (non-unital in general). The quotient map µ: D→ →DAs is universal among
the maps from D to associative algebras. In other words the associativizat ion
functor ( −)As : Dias → As is left adjoint to inc: As → Dias.
Axioms 12 and 45 imply that the element x⊢ y⊣ z in D depends only on
the values of x and z in DAs. Hence D is a DAs-bimodule and the projection
map µ is a DAs-bimodule map. On the other hand the dialgebra structure of
Dis completely determined by µand the DAs-bimodule structure on the space
D since
x⊣ y= xµ(y) and x⊢ y= µ(x) y,
cf. example 2.2.d. It is useful to write the element x⊢ y⊣ z as xˇyz. Under this
notation the dialgebra calculus rules are
xˇyz⊣ sˇtu= xˇyzstu,
xˇyz⊢ sˇtu= xyzsˇtu.

3. (CO)HOMOLOGY OF ASSOCIATIVE DIALGEBRAS
In this section we introduce a chain complex which permits us to deﬁne
homology groups HY∗(D) and cohomology groups HY∗(D) of a dialgebra D.
The main ingredient is the set of planar binary trees . The main result of this
section is the vanishing of the dialgebra homology of a free d ialgebra.
An extension of this theory to a theory with coeﬃcients is to b e found in
[F4].
3.1. Planar binary trees . A planar tree is binary if any vertex is trivalent.
We denote by Yn the set of planar binary trees with n+ 1 leaves. Since we only
use planar binary trees in this section we abbreviate it into tree (or n-tree to
specify that it has n+ 1 leaves, or, equivalently, n interior vertices).
Y0 = { | } , Y1 = {

}.
We will use the permutation-like notation of trees (cf. Appe ndix A):
[0] , [1] , [12], [21] , [123], [213], [131], [312], [321]
The number of elements in Yn is the Catalan number cn = (2n)!
n!(n+1)! . For
any y∈ Yn we label the n+ 1 leaves by {0,1,· · · ,n} from left to right.
3.2. Face and degeneracy maps. For any i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a map,
called a face map , di : Yn→ Yn−1 which assigns to the tree y the tree diy
obtained from y by deleting the i-th leaf. For instance:
d0[213] = [12] , d1[213] = [12] , d2[213] = [12] , d3[213] = [21] .
For any i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a map, called a degeneracy map , si :
Yn→ Yn+1 which assigns to the tree y the ( n+ 1)-tree siy obtained by bifur-
cating the i-th leaf, that is replace it by
❅
❅
❅❅
 
 
  
. For instance
s0[0] = [1] ,s0[1] = [12] ,s1[1] = [21] .
The face and degeneracy maps satisfy all the classical simpl icial relations, except
for the relation sisi = si+1si. Indeed, this relation is not fulﬁlled on trees,
because
s0s0([0]) = [12] and s1s0([0]) = [21] .
So Y. is not a simplicial set, but only an almost simplicial set , (cf. [F3]).
For any i, 1 ≤ i≤ n− 1, there is a map
◦i : Yn → {⊣ ,⊢}
deﬁned as follows. The image of y ∈ Yn is ◦y
i = ⊣ (resp. ⊢) if the i-th leaf
points from the vertex to the left (resp. to the right). For in stance:
◦[131]
1 = ⊢ and ◦[131]
2 = ⊣ .
16
More generally one has
◦[j1,···,jn]
i = ⊣ if ji >ji+1 and ◦[j1,···,jn]
i = ⊢ if ji <ji+1, for 1 ≤ i≤ n− 1.
Here is the table in low dimension:
y d1 ◦1 d2 ◦2
[12] [1] ⊢
[21] [1] ⊣
[123] [12] ⊢ [12] ⊢
[213] [12] ⊣ [12] ⊢
[131] [21] ⊢ [12] ⊣
[312] [21] ⊣ [21] ⊢
[321] [21] ⊣ [21] ⊣
3.3. The chain complex of a dialgebra. Let D be a dialgebra over K.
Deﬁne the module of n-chains by
CYn(D) := K[Yn] ⊗ D⊗n,
in particular CY1(D) ∼
= D, CY2(D) ∼
= D⊗2 ⊕ D⊗2, more generally CYn(D) is
isomorphic to the direct sum of cn copies of D⊗n (indexed by Yn).
Deﬁne a linear map d: CYn(D) → CYn−1(D) by the following formula:
d(y; a1,· · · ,an) := −
n−1∑
i=1
(−1)i(di(y); a1,· · · ,ai−1,ai◦y
i ai+1,· · · ,an),
where y ∈ Yn and ai ∈ D. This formula has a meaning since ◦y
i = ⊣ or ⊢ and
D is a dialgebra. It is convenient to deﬁne
di(y; a1,· · · ,an) := ( di(y); a1,· · · ,ai−1,ai◦y
i ai+1,· · · ,an)
so that d= − ∑ n−1
i=1 (−1)idi.
3.4. Lemma. The face maps di : CYn(D) → CYn−1(D) satisfy the simplicial
relations
didj = dj−1di, for any 1 ≤ i<j ≤ n− 1.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove this identity in the lowest dimension, that is
(∗) d1d2 = d1d1 : CY3(D) → CY2(D)
17
The computation of didj(y; a,b,c ) splits into 5 cases corresponding to the ﬁve
trees with 4 leaves (cf. 3.1).
• Case [123] :
d1d2([123]; a,b,c ) = d1([12]; a,b ⊢ c) = ([1]; a⊢ (b⊢ c)),
d1d1([123]; a,b,c ) = d1([12]; (a⊢ b,c) = ([1]; ( a⊢ b) ⊢ c).
So relation ( ∗) follows from axiom 5.
• Case [213] :
d1d2([213]; a,b,c ) = d1([12]; a,b ⊢ c) = ([1]; a⊢ (b⊢ c)),
d1d1([213]; a,b,c ) = d1([12]; (a⊣ b,c) = ([1]; ( a⊣ b) ⊢ c).
So relation ( ∗) follows from axiom 4.
• Case [131] :
d1d2([131]; a,b,c ) = d1([12]; a,b ⊣ c) = ([1]; a⊢ (b⊣ c)),
d1d1([131]; a,b,c ) = d1([21]; (a⊢ b,c) = ([1]; ( a⊢ b) ⊣ c).
So relation ( ∗) follows from axiom 3.
• Case [312] :
d1d2([312]; a,b,c ) = d1([21]; a,b ⊢ c) = ([1]; a⊣ (b⊢ c)),
d1d1([312]; a,b,c ) = d1([21]; (a⊣ b,c) = ([1]; ( a⊣ b) ⊣ c).
So relation ( ∗) follows from axiom 2.
• Case [321] :
d1d2([321]; a,b,c ) = d1([21]; a,b ⊣ c) = ([1]; a⊣ (b⊣ c)),
d1d1([321]; a,b,c ) = d1([21]; (a⊣ b,c) = ([1]; ( a⊣ b) ⊣ c).
So relation ( ∗) follows from axiom 1.
The proof of the general case didj = dj−1di for i < jsplits into two
diﬀerent cases.
First, if j = i+ 1, then the proof is exactly as in low dimension and so
follows from the axioms of a dialgebra. Second, if j >i+1, then both operations
didj and dj−1di amount to perform the same modiﬁcation: removing the leaves
number j and i of the tree y, and replace ( a1,· · · ,an) by
(a1,· · · ,ai◦y
i ai+1,· · · ,aj ◦y
j aj+1,· · · ,an).
The point is that the leaf number j of y is the leaf number j− 1 of di(y).
18
So we have proved that didj = dj−1di for i<j .
3.5. Proposition. One has d◦ d= 0 and so (CY∗(D),d) is a chain-complex.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the previous lemma, like for a
pre-simplicial module.
Observe that in the chain complex
CY∗(D) : · · · → K[Yn] ⊗ D⊗n→ · · · → K[Y3] ⊗ D⊗3 → K[Y2] ⊗ D⊗2 (⊣,⊢)
− → D
the module of n-chains is the direct sum of cn copies of D⊗n (indexed by the
set of trees Yn), the ﬁrst diﬀerential is induced by the two products ⊣,⊢, and
the ﬁrst relation d2 = 0 coincides precisely with the 5 axioms of a dialgebra.
3.6. Homology and cohomology of a dialgebra. By deﬁnition the homol-
ogy of the dialgebra D is the homology of the chain-complex CY∗(D):
HYn(D) := Hn(CY∗(D),d), n≥ 1.
For n= 1 it is immediate that HY1(D) is the quotient of D by the submodule
generated by all the elements x⊣ y and x⊢ y,
HY1(D) = D/{x⊣ y,x ⊢ y | x,y ∈ D},
which we denote, sometimes, by D/D2.
By deﬁnition the cohomology of the dialgebra D is
HYn(D) := Hn(Hom(CY∗(D),K)), n≥ 1.
3.7. The chain bicomplex of a dialgebra. The chain complex of a dialgebra
is in fact the total chain complex associated to a bicomplex. Indeed, let Yp,q
be the subset of Yn made of the trees which are obtained by grafting a p-tree
with a q-tree (cf. Appendix A), where p+ q+ 1 = n. For instance
Y0,2 = {[321],[312]}, Y 1,1 = {[131]}, Y 2,0 = {[213],[123]}.
Let CYp,q := K[Yp,q] ⊗ D⊗n. Since for any y ∈ Yp,q the element di(y) is
either in Yp−1,q or in Yp,q−1, the face map di takes value either in CYp−1,q or
in CYp,q−1. So the chain bicomplex CY∗∗(D) is well-deﬁned and its associated
total complex is CY∗(D). Remark that, with our choice of notation, one has
CYn = ⨁
p+q+1=nCYp,q. This bicomplex gives rise to two spectral sequences
abutting to HY∗(D).
3.8. Theorem. Let V be a vector space over K and Dias(V) = TV ⊗ V ⊗ TV
be the free dialgebra over V (cf.2.5). Then, one has
HY1(Dias(V)) ∼
= V,
HYn(Dias(V)) = 0 , for n>1.
19
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is obvious since V ∼
= K ⊗ V ⊗ K is the quotient
of CY1 = TV ⊗ V ⊗ TV by the submodule generated by all the products of
elements of V.
To show that HYn = 0 for n> 1 we construct a homotopy
h= hn : K[Yn] ⊗ D⊗n→ K[Yn+1] ⊗ D⊗n+1
such that, for n> 1,
dhn + hn−1d= id n.
In order to write down h explicitly we use the degeneracy maps introduced in
3.2 and the following construction. Given an n-tree y, we denote by pn(y) the
(n+ 1)-tree obtained from y by adding a new leaf at the left of the last one
and parallel to it:

There are ﬁve diﬀerent formulas for hn(x) depending on the form of x ∈
K[Yn] ⊗ D⊗n.
• Case (a): x= ( y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇωnu). One puts
hn(y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇωnu) := ( −1)n(sn(y); ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇωn,ˇu).
First, one has dihn(x) + hn−1di(x) = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1 because the modiﬁ-
cations on x performed by h and d are disjoint. Second, one has
(−1)ndnhn(x) = dn(sn(y); ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇωn,ˇu) = ( y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇωnu) = x
since dnsn(y) = y and ◦sn(y)
n = ⊣ . So we have proved relation (*) in this case.
• Case (b): x= ( y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ωnvˇu). One puts
hn(y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ωnvˇu) := ( −1)n(pn(y); ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ωnˇv,ˇu).
First, one has dihn(x) + hn−1di(x) = 0 for 1 ≤ i≤ n− 1. Second, one has
(−1)ndnhn(x) = dn(pn(y); ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ωnˇv,ˇu) = ( y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ωnvˇu) = x
since dnpn(y) = y and ◦pn(y)
n = ⊢ .So we have proved relation (*) in this case.
• Case (c): x= ( y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇu) and the last two leaves of y have the shape

. One puts
hn(y; ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1,ˇu) := 0 .
First, one has dihn(x) = 0 for 1 ≤ i≤ n and hn−1di(x) = 0 for 1 ≤ i≤ n− 2.
Second, one has
(−1)n−1hn−1dn−1(x) = ( −1)n−1hn−1(dn−1(y); ˇω1,..., ˇωn−1u) = x
20
since (by using case (b)) sndn−1(y) = y for such y. So we have proved relation
(*) in this case.

Let us write hn = ( −1)ns
n+(−1)n−1pn−1. First, one has dihn(x)+hn−1di(x) =
0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 2. Second, one has dn−1hn(x) + hn−1dn−1(x) = x since
dn−1sn(x) = hn−1dn−1(x) and dn−1pn−1(x) = x. Third, one has dnhn(x) = 0
since dnpn−1(x) = dnsn(x). So we have proved relation (*) in this case.

Let us write hn = ( −1)nsn+(−1)n−1sn−1. First, one has dihn(x)+hn−1di(x) =
0 for 1 ≤ i≤ n− 2. Observe that in many cases dihn = 0 = hn−1di. Second,
one has dn−1hn(x) + hn−1dn−1(x) = x since dn−1sn(x) = hn−1dn−1(x) and
dn−1sn−1(x) = x. Third, one has dnhn(x) = 0 since dnsn−1(x) = dnsn(x). So
we have proved relation (*) in this case.
3.9. Theorem. For any dialgebra D the graded module HY∗(D) is a graded
dual-codialgebra and the graded module HY∗(D) is a graded dendriform algebra
(see section 5). As a consequence HY∗(D) is a graded associative algebra.
Proof. Though one could prove these statements directly, they are c onsequences
of general facts about Koszul operads (see Appendix B). We wi ll show in section
6 that the operad of dendriform algebras is dual to the operad of associative
dialgebras. Moreover, by theorem 3.8 these operads are Kosz ul, hence the
statement follows from general properties of Koszul operad s (cf. Appendix
B5d). The last statement is a consequence of the preceding on e and of Lemma
7.3.
3.10. Simplicial properties of the chain-modules. We have seen in
Lemma 3.4 that the face maps di : CYn(D) → CYn−1(D) satisfy the standard
simplicial relations. Suppose that D is equipped with a bar- unit e and let us
deﬁne sj : CYn(D) → CYn+1(D) by
sj(y; a1,· · · ,an) := ( sj(y); a1,· · · ,aj,e,a j+1,· · · ,an), 0 ≤ j ≤ n,
where sj(y) is described in 3.2. From the properties of the bar-unit, it is
immediate to check that
disj =



sj−1di for i<j ,
id for i= j, i= j+ 1,
sjdi−1 for i>j + 1,
sisj = sj+1si for i<j.
21
So the family ( CYn(D); di,sj)n≥0 is an almost simplicial module , that is the
face and degeneracy operators satisfy all the standard rela tions of a simplicial
module, except for the relation sisi = si+1si (cf. 3.2).
A variation of the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem is still valid f or pseudo-simplicial
modules (cf. Inassaridze [I]) and a fortiori for almost simp licial modules. It is
used in the proof of the following result which is due to Aless andra Frabetti.
3.11. Theorem [F4]. If D is a dialgebra equipped with a bar-unit, then
HYn(D) = 0 , for any n≥ 0.
Comment. This result is similar to the vanishing of the bar-homology f or a
unital associative algebra.
3.12. Generalization of the homology of a dialgebra to the sy mmetric
group. There is a generalization of the complex CY∗ consisting in replacing
the set of planar binary trees Yn by the symmetric group Sn, or, equivalently,
by the set ˜Yn of binary increasing trees (cf. Appendix A).
The formulas for the maps di are the same as in 3.2 and 3.3 once Sn has
been identiﬁed with ˜Yn (observe that deleting a leaf in an increasing tree still
gives an increasing tree). Hence we get a new complex
CS∗(D) : · · · → K[Sn] ⊗ D⊗n→ · · · → K[S3] ⊗ D⊗3 → K[S2] ⊗ D⊗2 (⊣,⊢)
− → D
for any dialgebra D, and new homology groups HS∗(D).
The boundary map is still the alternate sum of face maps. When the
dialgebra is bar-unital, then there also exist degeneracy m aps. All these maps
satisfy the simplicial relations except the relations involving only the degeneracy
maps. Such an object is called a pseudo-simplicial module (cf. [I]).
Forgetting the levels gives a map Ψ : Sn = ˜Yn → Yn (cf. Appendix A)
which induces a chain map CS∗(D) → CY∗(D) and hence a morphism
HS∗(D) → HY∗(D).
This new theory HS∗, or, more accurately, its variant with non trivial coeﬃ-
cients, crops up naturally when one wants to compute the Leib niz homology of
the Leibniz algebra of matrices gl(D) over a dialgebra D (cf. Frabetti [F2]).
3.13. Remark. We will show in section 6 that CY∗(D) is the chain complex
of the dialgebra D predicted by the operad theory. One could wonder if there
is another notion of algebra for which CS∗(D) would be the predicted chain
complex. If this would be the case, then the Poincar´ e series of the dual operad
would be the inverse of the series

4. LEIBNIZ ALGEBRAS, ASSOCIATIVE DIALGEBRAS AND
HOMOLOGY
A Leibniz algebra is a non-commutative version of a Lie algeb ra. In this
section we show that, when we replace Lie algebras by Leibniz algebras, then
the role of associative algebras is played by the associativ e dialgebras. In par-
ticular we show that any Leibniz algebra has a universal enveloping associative
dialgebra.
4.1. Leibniz algebras [L1], [LP]. Recall that a Leibniz algebra over K is a
K-module g equipped with a binary operation (called a bracket):
[−,−] : g ⊗ g → g,
which satisﬁes the Leibniz identity :
[x,[y,z]] = [[ x,y],z] − [[x,z],y],
for all x,y,z in g. This is in fact a right Leibniz algebra. For the opposite
structure, that is [ x,y]′ = [ y,x], the left Leibniz identity is
[[x,y]′,z]′ = [ x,[y,z]′]′ − [y,[x,z]′]′.
If the bracket happens to be anticommutative, then g is a Lie algebra. Quoti-
enting the Leibniz algebra g by the ideal generated by the elements [ x,x] for
all x∈ g gives a Lie algebra that we denote by gLie.
To any Leibniz algebra g is associated a chain-complex
CL∗(g) : ... − →g⊗n d
− →g⊗n−1 d
− →...
d
− →g⊗2 d
− →g
where
d(x1,...,x n) =
∑
1≤i<j≤n
(−1)j(x1,...,x i−1,[xi,xj],xi+1,..., ˆxj,...,x n).
The homology groups of this complex are denoted by HLn(g), for n≥ 1.
4.2. Proposition. Let D be a dialgebra. Then the bracket
[x,y] := x⊣ y− y⊢ x
makes D into a Leibniz algebra, denoted by DLeib.
Proof. It is a straightforward checking in which axioms (1), (2), ( 4), (5)
are used once and axiom (3) twice since
[x,[y,z]] = x⊣(y⊣ z) − x⊣(z⊢ y) − (y⊣ z) ⊢ x+ (z⊢ y) ⊢ x,
−[[x,y],z]] = −(x⊣ y) ⊣ z+ (y⊢ x) ⊣ z+ z⊢(x⊣ y) − z⊢(y⊢ x),
[[x,z],y]] = ( x⊣ z) ⊣ y− (z⊢ x) ⊣ y− y⊢(x⊣ z) + y⊢(z⊢ x).
23
This construction deﬁnes a functor
Dias
−
− →Leib
from the category Dias of dialgebras to the category Leib of Leibniz algebras.
4.3. Example. For any dialgebra D over K the n× n-matrices with entries
in D form a new dialgebra Mn(D). Its associated Leibniz algebra is denoted
gln(D). It is not a Lie algebra in general. The homology of gl(D), when D
has a bar-unit, has been computed by Frabetti [F2].
4.4. Proposition. The following diagram of categories and functors is com-
mutative
Dias
−
− → Leib
↑ ↑
As
−
− → Lie.
4.5. Remark. In the deﬁnition of a dialgebra, axiom (3) could be relaxed
slightly, though proposition 4.2 remains valid. It could be replaced by the
weaker axiom:
((y⊢ x) ⊣ z) + ( z⊢ (x⊣ y)) = ( y⊢ (x⊣ z)) + (( z⊢ x) ⊣ y).
Observe that in this formula the variables do not stay in the s ame order in
the monomials. Hence the associated operad would not be a non -Σ-operad
anymore.
4.6. Universal enveloping associative dialgebra of a Leibn iz algebra.
The functor − : As → Lie has a left adjoint which is the universal enveloping
algebra of a Lie algebra:
U(g) = T(g)/{[x,y] − x⊗ y+ y⊗ x| x,y ∈ g}.
(U(g) is the augmentation ideal of the classical enveloping unit al algebra U(g)).
Similarly, deﬁne the universal enveloping dialgebra of a Leibniz algebra g as
the following quotient of the free dialgebra on g:
Ud(g) := T(g) ⊗ g ⊗ T(g)/{[x,y] − x⊣ y+ y⊢ x| x,y ∈ g}.
Under our previous notation, the elements generating the id eal are denoted
by [ x,y] ˇ− ˇxy+ yˇx.
4.7. Proposition. The functor Ud : Leib → Dias is left adjoint to the functor
− : Dias → Leib.
Proof. Let f : g → DLeib be a morphism of Leibniz algebras. There is a unique
extension of f as a morphism of dialgebras from T(g)⊗g⊗T(g) to D. Since the
24
image of [ x,y] − x⊣ y+ y⊢ xunder this morphism is 0, it deﬁnes a morphism
from Ud(g) to D.
On the other hand the restriction of the morphism of dialgebr as g :
Ud(g) → Dto g = K⊗g ⊗K yields a morphism of Leibniz algebras g → DLeib.
It is now immediate to check that these two constructions giv e rise to
isomorphisms
HomDias(Ud(g),D) ∼
= HomLeib(g,DLeib).It is well-known that the universal enveloping algebra of a L ie algebra is
not only an associative algebra but a Hopf algebra. Similarl y the universal
enveloping dialgebra of a Leibniz algebra possesses co-ope rations. They are
studied by Goichot in [Go].
4.8. Lemma. For any Leibniz algebra g, one has Ud(g)As = U(gLie).
Proof. Since the functor ( −)As : Dias → As is left adjoint to inc : As →
Dias and since ( −)Lie : Leib → Lie is left adjoint to inc : Lie → Leib
both composites U ◦ (−)Lie and ( −)As ◦ Ud are left adjoint to the composite
Leib → Lie → As, and so are equal.
4.9. Proposition. The universal enveloping dialgebra Ud(g) is isomorphic
to U(gLie) ⊗ g, equipped with the dialgebra structure issued from a U(gLie)-
bimodule structure and the bimodule map U(gLie) ⊗ g → U(gLie) (cf. example
2.2.d).
Proof. Let us deﬁne a U(gLie)-bimodule structure on U(gLie) ⊗ g. The left
module structure is given by multiplication in the left fact or. The right module
structure is induced by
(ω⊗ x) · ¯y:= ω⊗ [x,y] + ω¯y⊗ x,
where ω ∈ U(gLie),x ∈ g,¯y ∈ gLie and y ∈ g is a lifting of ¯ y ∈ gLie. It
is a well-deﬁned element because the bracket [ x,y] in the Leibniz algebra g
depends only on the class of y in gLie. Let us check that this formula provides
a representation of gLie.
Let ¯y and ¯z be elements in gLie and y,z be liftings in g. On one hand one
gets
((ω⊗ x· ¯y) · ¯z= ω⊗ [[x,y],z] + ω¯z⊗ [x,y] + ω¯y⊗ [x,z] + ω¯y¯z⊗ x,
and
((ω⊗ x· ¯z) · ¯y= ω⊗ [[x,z],y] + ω¯y⊗ [x,z] + ω¯z⊗ [x,y] + ω¯z¯y⊗ x.
Hence one has
((ω⊗ x· ¯z) · ¯y− ((ω⊗ x· ¯z) · ¯y= ω⊗ ([x,y],z] − [x,z],y]) − ω(¯y¯z− ¯z¯y) ⊗ x
= ω⊗ [x,[y,z]] − ω
[y,z] ⊗ x
= ( ω⊗ x) · [y,z] .
25
The right and left module structures are immediately seen to be compatible,
hence U(gLie) ⊗ g is a U(gLie)-bimodule.
The linear map U(gLie)⊗g → U(gLie),ω ⊗x↦→ω¯xis a U(gLie)-bimodule
because ω¯x¯y= ω[x,y] + ω¯y¯x.
So, it follows that U(gLie) ⊗ g is equipped with a dialgebra structure (cf.
22.d). The (nonunital) associative algebra associated to t his dialgebra is the
augmentation ideal of U(gLie), cf. 2.6.
There is a well-deﬁned dialgebra map
Ud(g) → U(gLie) ⊗ g
which sends ω⊗x⊗1 to ¯ω⊗x(for ω∈ T(g) and ¯ωits image in U(gLie)). Indeed,
any element in Ud(g) can be written as a linear combination of elements of the
form ω⊗ x⊗ 1 since
ω⊗ x⊗ y= ω⊗ [x,y] ⊗ 1 + ωy⊗ x⊗ 1.
Since by lemma 4.8 one has Ud(g)As = U(gLie), it follows that the element
ωˇxω′ in Ud(g) depends only on the class of ω ∈ T(g) (resp. ω′ ∈ T(g)) in
U(gLie). So, on can deﬁne a dialgebra map
U(gLie) ⊗ g → Ud(g)
by sending ¯ω⊗ x to ωˇx, where ω is a lifting of ¯ ω.
It is immediate to check that both composites are the identit y, whence the
isomorphism.
4.10. Free algebras and free dialgebras. Let V be a K-module and let
T(V) = V ⊕ V⊗2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V⊗n ⊕ · · · be the tensor module. We denote by
γ the endomorphism of T(V) deﬁned inductively by γ(v) = v for v ∈ V and
γ(ω⊗ v) = ω ⊗ v − v ⊗ ω for ω ∈ V⊗n and v ∈ V. It is well-known that
Im γ is isomorphic to the free Lie algebra Lie(V) over V. Recall that the free
associative algebra over V is T(V) equipped with the concatenation product,
and the free Leibniz algebra over V is T(V) equipped with the unique Leibniz
bracket which satisﬁes [ ω,v] = ω⊗ v for ω∈ V⊗n and v∈ V (cf. [LP]). In the
sequence
T(V)
γ
→ Lie(V)֒→T(V),
the ﬁrst map is a map of Leibniz algebras, the second one is a ma p of Lie
algebras (for the Lie structure of T(V) coming from its associative algebra
structure). From Proposition 4.4 it follows that there is a c ommutative diagram
Leib(V) = T(V)
γˇ
1
− → T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V) = Dias(V)
γ ↓ ↓ fusion
Lie(V)֒→T(V) = As(V)
26
where the maps fusion and γˇ
1 are described as follows.
The fusion map consists in forgetting the symbolˇ, that is ωˇvω′ ↦→ωvω′.
The image of v1 · · · vn by γˇ
1 is γ(ˇv1v2 · · · vn), which means writing γ(v1 · · · vn)
and putting the symbol ˇ on the variable v1 of each monomial. For instance
γˇ
1(v1) = ˇv1,γˇ
1(v1 ⊗ v2) = ˇv1v2 − v2ˇv1,γˇ
1(v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ v3) = ˇv1v2v3 − v2 ˇv1v3 −
v3 ˇv1v2 + v3v2 ˇv1.
One observes that this map is very similar to the map αused by Lodder in
[Lo] to describe the loop suspension of a wedge product of top ological spaces.
4.11. Proposition. Let V be a K-module and Leib(V) = T(V) be the free
Leibniz algebra on V. Then one has an isomorphism
Ud(Leib(V)) ∼
= Dias(V) = T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V).
Proof. The functor Leib is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from Leibniz
algebras to modules. Similarly the functor Ud is left adjoint to the functor
from dialgebras to Leibniz algebras, therefore the composi te is left adjoint to
the forgetful functor from dialgebras to modules, so it is th e free diassociative
algebra functor.
4.12. Theorem. For any dialgebra D there is a natural transformation
HL∗(DLeib) − →HS∗(D)
induced by the chain complex map
ǫn : CLn(DLeib) = D⊗n − →K[Sn] ⊗ D⊗n = CSn(D),
ǫn(x1,· · · ,xn) =
∑
σ∈Sn
sgn(σ)σ⊗ σ−1(x1,· · · ,xn).
Proof. The boundary map dL of the Leibniz complex CL∗ is described in
4.1. For any element ( x,y) := ( x1,...,x n,y) ∈ D⊗n+1 the map dL is deﬁned
inductively by the formula:
(4.12.1) dL(x
,y) = ( dL(x),y) + ( −1)nad (y)(x),
where ad ( y)(x) = ad ( y)(x1,...,x n) := ∑ n
i=1(x1,...,x i⊣ y− y⊢ xi,...,x n).
The boundary map dS of the symmetric complex CS∗ is described in 3.12
and 3.2.
One extends the operator ad ( y) to K[Sn]⊗D⊗n by putting ad ( y)(σ⊗x
) =
σ⊗ ad (y)(x) ∈ K[Sn] ⊗ D⊗n, so that it obviously commutes with ǫn:
(4.12.2) ǫnad (y) = ad ( y)ǫn.
27
It turns out that this new operator is homotopic to 0. The homo topy h(y) :
K[Sn] ⊗ D⊗n → K[Sn+1] ⊗ D⊗n+1 is given by
h(y)(σ⊗ x) :=
n∑
i=0
(−1)isi(σ) ⊗ (x1,...,x i,y,x i+1,...,x n),
where si(σ) is the i-th degeneracy of σ (bifurcate the i-th leaf of the corre-
sponding increasing tree, cf. 3.2). The checking of
(4.12.3) dSh(y) + h(y)dS = ad ( y)
is tedious but straightforward.
The comparison of the homotopy operator h(y) with the symmetrization
operator ǫn gives:
(4.12.4) ǫn+1(x
,y) = ( −1)nh(y)ǫn(x).
The proof of the commutation relation
(∗)n dS ◦ ǫn = ǫn−1 ◦ dL
is done by induction on n as follows.
For n= 1, one has ǫ1 = Id.
For n= 2, the map ǫ2 : D⊗2 → K[S2] ⊗ D⊗2 is given by
ǫ2(x,y) = [12] ⊗ (x,y) − [21] ⊗ (y,x).
Since dL(x,y) = [ x,y] and dS([12] ⊗ (x,y)) = x⊣ y, dS([21] ⊗ (x,y)) = x⊢ y, it
follows from [ x,y] = x⊣ y− y⊢ x that dS ◦ ǫ2 = ǫ1 ◦ dL.
By induction we suppose that ( ∗)n holds and we will prove ( ∗)n+1.
One gets:
dSǫn+1(x,y) = ( −1)ndSh(y)ǫn(x) by (4.12.4)
= ( −1)n(ad (y) − h(y)dS)ǫn(x) by (4.12.3)
= ( −1)nad (y)ǫn(x) + ( −1)n−1h(y)ǫn−1dL(x) by induction
= ( −1)nad (y)ǫn(x) + ǫn(dL(x),y) by (4.12.4)
= ( −1)nǫn(x) ad (y) + ǫn(dL(x),y) by (4.12.2)
= ǫndL(x,y) by (4.12.1).
Remark. This proof is mimicked on the proof for the Lie case as done in
[L0], Proposition 1.3.5. This Proposition has been extende d to homology of
dialgebras with coeﬃcients by Alessandra Frabetti in her th esis (unpublished).
28
4.13. Proposition. The composite
HL∗(DLeib) → HS∗(D)
ψ∗
− →HY∗(D),
where ψn : Sn→ →Yn is the surjective map described in Appendix A, is the map
induced, through the operad theory, by the morphism of opera ds Dias! → Leib!.
Proof. We show in section 8 that the complexes CL∗ and CY∗ are the complexes
predicted by the operad theory. So, by Appendix B5e, it suﬃce s to check that
the natural map K[Yn] ⊗ K[Sn] = Dias!(n) → Leib!(n) = K[Sn] on the dual
operads (see section 8) is given by y⊗ ω ↦→∑
{σ∈Sn|ψ(σ)=y} σω , and this is
precisely Theorem 7.5.
4.14. Comparison of HL∗(g) and HY∗(Ud(g)) for a Leibniz algebra g.
For a Lie algebra h the composite map
HLie
∗ (h) → HLie
∗ ( ¯U(h)Lie) → HAs
∗ ( ¯U(h)),
is known to be an isomorphism (cf. for instance [L0]).
However, for a Leibniz algebra g, the composite map
HL∗(g) → HL∗(Ud(g)Leib) → HY∗(Ud(g))
is no longer an isomorphism, contrarily to what was mistaken ly announced in
[L2]. The main point in the proof of the Lie case, is that the gr aded space
associated to the ﬁltration of U(g) depends only on the vector space g, and
not on the Lie structure. In the Leibniz case, the graded spac e associated to
Ud(g) = U(gLie) ⊗ g (cf. Proposition 4.9) depends on gLie, that is, on the
Leibniz structure of g. Hence the map HL∗(g) → HY∗(Ud(g)) is part of a
spectral sequence involving the derived functors of “Lie-z ation”.
4.15. Poisson dialgebra. By deﬁnition a Poisson dialgebra P is a vector
space P equipped with a dialgebra structure ⊣ and ⊢, and a Leibniz struc-
ture [ −,−] which are compatible in the sense that they satisfy the foll owing 4
relations:
[x,y ⊣ z] = y⊢ [x,z] + [ x,y] ⊣ z= [ x,y ⊢ z],
[x⊣ y,z] = x⊣ [y,z] + [ x,z] ⊣ y,
[x⊢ y,z] = x⊢ [y,z] + [ x,z] ⊢ y.
This deﬁnition generalizes the “non-commutative Poisson a lgebra” as deﬁned
in [Kub], [KS] and [Ak].

5. DENDRIFORM ALGEBRAS
In this chapter we construct a new type of algebra with two bin ary op-
erations, which dichotomizes the notion of associative alg ebra. It is closely
related to associative dialgebras. In fact, we show in secti on 8 that its operad
is Koszul dual to the operad of associative dialgebras. The t erminology is due
to the structure of the free dendriform algebra, which is bes t described in terms
of planar binary trees.
5.1. Deﬁnition. A dendriform algebra E over K is a K-vector space E
equipped with two binary operations
≺ : E⊗ E→ E,
≻ : E⊗ E→ E,
which satisfy the following axioms:
(i) ( a≺ b) ≺ c= a≺ (b≺ c) + a≺ (b≻ c),
(ii) ( a≻ b) ≺ c= a≻ (b≺ c),
(iii) ( a≺ b) ≻ c+ (a≻ b) ≻ c= a≻ (b≻ c),
for any elements a,b and c in E.
It is sometimes preferable to call this object dendriform dialgebra to in-
sist on the fact that it is deﬁned by two operations, but we do n ot use this
terminology here. It is important to observe that, like for a ssociative alge-
bras and associative dialgebras, the monomials involved in the relations keep
the variables in the same order. As a consequence the associa ted operad is a
non-Σ-operad.
Observe that there is no “monoid” version of dendriform alge bras, since
relations (i) and (iii) involve sums. In other words, the ass ociated operad does
not come from a set-operad.
By introducing the operation
x∗ y:= x≺ y+ x≻ y,
these relations take the following more concise form:
(i) ( a≺ b) ≺ c= a≺ (b∗ c),
(ii) ( a≻ b) ≺ c= a≻ (b≺ c),
(iii) ( a∗ b) ≻ c= a≻ (b≻ c).
5.2. Lemma. For any dendriform algebra E the product deﬁned by
x∗ y:= x≺ y+ x≻ y.
is associative.
30
Proof. Adding up the three equalities (i), (ii) and (iii) we get ( x∗ y) ∗ z on the
left hand side and x∗ (y∗ z) on the right hand side, whence the statement.
It follows from this lemma that a dendriform algebra is in fac t an asso-
ciative algebra, whose product has some special property. T he category of
dendriform algebras is denoted by Dend.
5.3. Proposition. Let D be a dialgebra and E a dendriform algebra. Then,
on the tensor product D⊗ E, the bracket
[x⊗ a,y ⊗ b] :=( x⊣ y) ⊗ (a≺ b) − (y⊢ x) ⊗ (b≻ a)
− (y⊣ x) ⊗ (b≺ a) + ( x⊢ y) ⊗ (a≻ b),
where x,y ∈ D,a,b ∈ E, deﬁnes a structure of Lie algebra.
Proof. The bracket is antisymmetric by deﬁnition. Hence, it suﬃce s to show
that the Jacobi identity is fulﬁlled.
The Jacobi identity for x⊗ a, y⊗ b, z⊗ cgives a total of 48 terms, in fact
8 × 3! terms. There are 8 terms for which x,y,z (and also a,b,c ) stay in the
same order. The other sets of 8 terms are permutations of this set which reads:
x⊣ (y⊣ z) ⊗ a≺ (b≺ c) − (x⊣ y) ⊣ z⊗ (a≺ b) ≺ c,
x⊢ (y⊣ z) ⊗ a≻ (b≺ c) − (x⊢ y) ⊣ z⊗ (a≻ b) ≺ c,
x⊣ (y⊢ z) ⊗ a≺ (b≻ c) − (x⊣ y) ⊢ z⊗ (a≺ b) ≻ c,
x⊢ (y⊢ z) ⊗ a≻ (b≻ c) − (x⊢ y) ⊢ z⊗ (a≻ b) ≻ c.
The terms 1 and 3 in column 1 together with the term 1 in column 2 cancel
due to axioms (1), (2) and (i). Similarly the terms 41, 32 and 4 2 cancel due to
axioms (4), (5) and (iii). Finally the terms 21 and 22 cancel d ue to axioms (3)
and (ii).
This result may also be seen as a consequence of Koszul dualit y (cf. Ap-
pendix B).
5.4. Examples of dendriform algebras.
(a) Shuﬄe algebra. Let V be a vector space and let T′(V) be the reduced tensor
module over V equipped with the shuﬄe product (which is associative and
commutative). The shuﬄe of two generating elements v1 · · · vp and vp+1 · · · vp+q
can be split into two parts depending on the fact that the ﬁrst element is v1 or
vp+1. The ﬁrst part gives the left product and the second part give s the right
product. One can show that the shuﬄe algebra is then a dendrif orm algebra
(this fact had been previously remarked by Gian-Carlo Rota) .
(b) Matrices over dendriform algebras. Since in the axioms of a dendriform
algebra the variables a,b,c stay in this order in all the monomials, the tensor
product of two dendriform algebras is naturally a dendrifor m algebra. Similarly,
let Mn(E) be the module of n× n-matrices with entries in the dendriform
algebra E. Then the formulas
(α≺ β)ij =
∑
k
αik ≺ βkj and ( α≻ β)ij =
∑
k
αik ≻ βkj
31
make Mn(E) into a dendriform algebra.
(c) Free dendriform algebra. Let V be a K-module and denote by Dend(V)
the free dendriform algebra over V. It is a dendriform algebra which satisﬁes
the classical universal property. We will prove its existen ce and give an explicit
description in 5.7. As a ﬁrst step we describe the free dendri form algebra on
one generator by using the sets of planar binary trees Yn, and some operations
on them.
5.5. Grafting operation on trees. By deﬁnition the grafting of the trees
y ∈ Yp and z ∈ Yq is the tree y ∨ z ∈ Yp+q+1 obtained from y and z by
joining their roots together and adding a new root. Observe t hat the number
of internal vertices of y∨ z is the sum of the numbers of internal vertices of y
and of z plus 1.
Given a tree y(diﬀerent from | ) there is a unique decomposition y= y1∨y2.
For instance one has:

.
which, with our notation, reads
[1] = [0] ∨ [0], [12] = [1] ∨ [0], [21] = [0] ∨ [1].
The grafting operation is easy to write down in terms of the pe rmutation-
like notation. Indeed, for y∈ Yp and z∈ Yq, one has
[y] ∨ [z] = [ y p+ q+ 1 z].
For instance one has:
[1] ∨ [1] = [1 3 1] , [1 3 1] ∨ [2 1] = [1 3 1 6 2 1] .
We put K[Y∞] := ⊕n≥0K[Yn] and K[Y∞] := ⊕n≥1K[Yn]. We introduce
recursively the following operations on K[Y∞]:
y≺ z := y1 ∨ (y2 ∗ z),(5.5.1)
y≻ z := ( y∗ z1) ∨ z2,(5.5.2)
y∗ z := y≺ z+ y≻ z,(5.5.3)
x≺ | := x=: | ≻ x and x≻ | := 0 =: | ≺ x, for x̸= |.(5.5.4)
for y∈ Yp and z ∈ Yq. Observe that | is a unit for ∗.
Since the decomposition y= y1 ∨y2 is unique, it is clear that these formulas
are well-deﬁned by recursion. For instance

or, equivalently, [1] ≺ [1] = [21] , [1] ≻ [1] = [12].
These operations are extended to K[Y∞] by linearity. Observe that [0] ∗
[0] = [0], but [0] ≺ [0] and [0] ≻ [0] are not deﬁned.
5.6. Lemma. The vector space ⊕n≥1K[Yn] equipped with the two operations ≺

Proof. We prove this assertion by induction on the (total) degree of the trees.
Let y= y1 ∨ y2, y′ = y′
1 ∨ y′
2 and y′′ = y′′
1 ∨ y′′
2 be planar binary trees. The
following equalities follow by induction from the deﬁnitio ns of the operations
and the associativity of ∗:
(i) ( y≺ y′) ≺ y′′ = ( y1 ∨ (y2 ∗ y′)) ≺ y′′
= y1 ∨ (y2 ∗ y′ ∗ y′′) = y≺ (y′ ≺ y′′) + y≺ (y′ ≻ y′′).
(ii) y≻ (y′ ≺ y′′) = y≻ (y′
1 ∨ (y′
2 ∗ y′′)) = ( y∗ y′
1) ∨ (y′
2 ∗ y′′)
= (( y∗ y′
1) ∨ y′
2) ≺ y′′ = ( y≻ y′) ≺ y′′.
(iii) y≻ (y′ ≻ y′′) = y≻ ((y′ ∗ y′′
1 ) ∨ y′′
2 )
= ( y∗ y′ ∗ y′′
1 ) ∨ y′′
2 = ( y≺ y′) ≻ y′′ + (y≻ y′) ≻ y′′.
Let us show that K[Y∞] is generated by [1] under the operations ≺ and ≻. Let
y= y1 ∨ y2 be a tree. From the deﬁnitions of the operations we have
y1 ∨ y2 := [1] if y1 = [0] = y2,
:= [1] ≺ y2 if y1 = [0] ̸= y2,
:= y1 ≻ [1] if y1 ̸= [0] = y2,
:= y1 ≻ [1] ≺ y2 if y1 ̸= [0] ̸= y2.
Therefore, by induction, it is clear that K[Y∞] is generated by [1].
5.7. Proposition. The unique dendriform algebra map Dend(K) → ⊕ n≥1K[Yn]
which sends the generator x of Dend(K) to [1] is an isomorphism.
Proof. Let us show that the dendriform algebra ( K[Y∞],≺,≻) deﬁned in 5.5
satisﬁes the universal condition to be the free dendriform a lgebra on one gen-
erator.
Let D be a dendriform algebra and a an element in D. Deﬁne a linear
map α: K[Y∞] → D by its value on the trees y= y1 ∨ y2 as follows :
α(y1 ∨ y2) := a if y1 = [0] = y2,
:= a≺ α(y2) if y1 = [0] ̸= y2,
:= α(y1) ≻ a if y1 ̸= [0] = y2,
:= α(y1) ≻ a≺ α(y2) if y1 ̸= [0] ̸= y2.
33
We claim that αis a morphism of dendriform algebras. The proof is by induc-
tion on the degree of the tree. Indeed, on one hand
α(y≺ z) = α(y1 ∨ (y2 ∗ z))
= α(y1) ≻ a≺ α(y2 ∗ z)
= α(y1) ≻ a≺ (α(y2) ∗ α(z)).
On the other hand,
α(y) ≺ α(z) = ( α(y1) ≻ a≺ α(y2)) ≺ α(z)
= (( α(y1) ≻ a) ≺ α(y2)) ≺ α(z)
= ( α(y1) ≻ a) ≺ (α(y2) ∗ α(z))
= α(y1) ≻ a≺ (α(y2) ∗ α(z)).
Here we supposed that y1 ̸= [0] ̸= y2, but the proof is similar for the other
cases.
Since by lemma 5.6 K[Y∞] is generated by [1], the morphism α such that
α([1]) = a is unique.
It follows that ( K[Y∞],≺,≻) is the free dendriform algebra on one gener-
ator.
5.8. Theorem (Free dendriform algebra). The unique dendriform algebra
map
Dend(V) → ⊕ n≥1K[Yn] ⊗ V⊗n
which sends the generator v∈ V to [1] ⊗ v is an isomorphism.
Proof. Deﬁne the dendriform algebra structure on ⊕n≥1K[Yn] ⊗ V⊗n by
y⊗ ω≺ y′ ⊗ ω′ := ( y≺ y′) ⊗ ωω′,
y⊗ ω≻ y′ ⊗ ω′ := ( y≻ y′) ⊗ ωω′.
Since in the relations deﬁning a dendriform algebra the vari ables stay in the
same order, the free dendriform algebra over V is completely determined by
the free dendriform algebra on one generator:
Dend(V) =
⨁
n≥1
Dend(K)n ⊗ V⊗n,
where Dend(K)n is the subspace of Dend(K) generated by all the possible
products of n copies of the generator. Hence, by proposition 5.7, one gets
Dend(V) ∼
= ⊕nK[Yn] ⊗ V⊗n.
5.9. Remark. The inverse isomorphism is obtained as follows. From y ∈ Yn
we construct a monomial in the variables x1,· · · ,xn by ﬁrst putting the variable
34
xi in between the leaves i− 1 and i. Then, for each vertex of depth one, we
replace the local patterns with two vertices by local patter ns with one vertex:

5.10. Nested sub-trees and quotients. Given a planar binary tree with
n+1 leaves and a consecutive sequence of k+1 leaves {i,...,i +k}, the sub-tree
of y which contains these leaves is isomorphic to a unique planar binary tree
with k+ 1 leaves, which we denote by y′. We say that the sub-tree y′ is nested
in y at i. By deﬁnition the quotient y′′ = y/y′ is the planar binary tree with
n− k+ 3 leaves obtained from y by removing the leaves {i+ 1,...,i + k− 1}.

y′ − → y − → y′′
Observe that y is a sub-tree of itself with quotient [1] =
❅
❅

 
 
  
, and that
there are n nested sub-trees of y of the form [1] (with quotient y).
In terms of the permutation-like notation the names of y′ and of y′′ are
obtained as follows. Let y = [ a1 ...a n]. Start with the sequence of integers
[ai+1 ...a i+k] and make it into a name of tree by ﬁrst replacing the largest
integer by k. Then proceed the same way with the two remaining intervals,
and so forth (like in A3). Ultimately one gets the name of y′. In our example we
get [2141]. The quotient tree y′′ of y by y′ is obtained by making the sequence
of numbers [ a1 ...a i aj ai+k+1 ...a n] into a name of tree as before ( aj is the
largest integer in [ ai+1 ...a i+k]). In our example we get [131].
35
5.11. Proposition. Under the isomorphism of Proposition 5.7 the compo-
sition operation in Dend(K) induces the following composition operation in
⊕n≥1K[Yn]:
y′′ ◦i y′ =
∑
y,
where the sum is extended over all the trees y which contain y′ as a nested
sub-tree at i and for which y/y′ = y′′.
Proof. Since the operad is quadratic it suﬃces to check this asserti on in low
dimension. The isomorphism gives [21] = x ≺ x and [12] = x ≻ x. The eight
distinct cases of composition are:
[21] ◦1 [21] = ( x≺ x) ≺ x= x≺ (x≺ x) + x≺ (x≻ x) = [213] + [312]
[21] ◦1 [12] = ( x≻ x) ≺ x= [131]
[21] ◦2 [21] = x≺ (x≺ x) = [321]
[21] ◦2 [12] = x≺ (x≻ x) = [312]
[12] ◦1 [21] = ( x≺ x) ≻ x= [213]
[12] ◦1 [12] = ( x≻ x) ≻ x= [123]
[12] ◦2 [21] = x≻ (x≺ x) = [131]
[12] ◦2 [12] = x≻ (x≻ x) = x≺ (x≻ x) + x≻ (x≻ x) = [213] + [312]
In each case we verify that the trees of the right hand side are precisely such
that y′ is nested at i with quotient y′′. For instance both [213] and [312] have
[21] nested at 1. .
5.12. Associative algebra structure on K[Y∞] and K[S∞]. By lemma
5.2 the vector space K[Y∞] is an associative algebra for the product
x∗ y= x≺ y+ x≻ y,
hence K[Y∞] is a graded associative and unital algebra whose structure is
completely determined by the following two conditions: | is a unit, the recursive
formula
y∗ z= y1 ∨ (y2 ∗ z) + ( y∗ z1) ∨ z2,
holds.
Observe that this algebra has an obvious involution: [ i1,...,i n] ↦→[in,...,i 1]
on trees. In theorem 3.8 of [LR] we prove that it is isomorphic to the tensor
algebra over K[Y0,∞], where Y0,n−1 := { y = | ∨ y′ ∈ Yn, for y′ ∈ Yn−1}. It is
also isomorphic to T(K[Y∞,0]), where Yn−1,0 := { y= y′ ∨ |}.
The map ψn : Sn → Yn (cf. Appendix A) induces a linear map ψ :
K[S∞] → K[Y∞]. There is an associative and unital algebra structure on
K[S∞] given by
x∗ y:= shn,m · (x× y) ∈ K[Sn+m],
where x ∈ Sn, y ∈ Sm and shn,m ∈ K[Sn+m] is the sum of all the ( n,m)-
shuﬄes. It is proved in [LR] that ψ is an associative algebra homomorphism.
36
5.13. Hopf structure on Dend(V). It is well-known that the free associative
algebra T(V) is in fact a cocommutative Hopf algebra, where the coproduc t is
given by the shuﬄe. Similarly there exists a structure of Hop f algebra on the
associative unital algebra K⊕ Dend(V) = ⊕n≥0K[Yn] ⊗ V⊗n. The coproduct
is completely determined by the shuﬄes and the coproduct on ⊕n≥0K[Yn] was
constructed in [LR]. Observe that this coproduct is not coco mmutative. It is
related to the “brace algebras” and has been studied in detai ls in [R].

6. (CO)HOMOLOGY OF DENDRIFORM ALGEBRAS
In this section we show that there exists a chain complex (of H ochschild
type), for any dendriform algebra. It enables us to construc t a homology and
a cohomology theory for dendriform algebras. It will be prov ed in section 8
that these theories are the ones predicted by the operad theo ry in characteristic
zero.
6.1. The chain complex of a dendriform algebra. Let E be a dendriform
algebra and let Cn be the set {1,· · · ,n}. We deﬁne the module of n-chains of
E as
CDend
n (E) := K[Cn] ⊗ E⊗n,
and the diﬀerential d = − ∑ n−1
i=1 (−1)idi : CDend
n (E) → CDend
n−1 (E) as follows.
First, we deﬁne the face operators di,1 ≤ i≤ n− 1, on r∈ Cn by
di(r) =
{
r− 1 if i≤ r− 1,
r if i≥ r.
These maps are extended linearly to maps
di : K[Cn] → K[Cn−1], 1 ≤ i≤ n− 1.
Second, we deﬁne the symbol ◦r
i as follows:
◦r
i =





∗ if i<r − 1,
≻ if i= r− 1,
≺ if i= r,
∗ if i>r.
Recall that x∗ y= x≺ y+ x≻ y.
Finally the map di : CDend
n (E) → CDend
n−1 (E) is given by
di(r; x1 ⊗ · · · xn) := ( di(r); x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xi−1 ⊗ xi ◦r
i xi+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn)
for 1 ≤ i≤ n− 1.
6.2. Lemma. The maps di : CDend
n (E) → CDend
n−1 (E) satisfy the simplicial
relations didj = dj−1di, for i<j , and so (CDend
∗ (E),d) is a chain complex.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the lowest dimensional case, that is d1d1 = d1d2 on
CDend
3 (E) = 3 E⊗3.
On the ﬁrst component ( r= 1) one gets:
d1d1(1; a⊗ b⊗ c) = d1(1; (a≺ b) ⊗ c) = (1; ( a≺ b) ≺ c),
d1d2(1; a⊗ b⊗ c) = d1(1; a⊗ (b∗ c)) = (1; a≺ (b∗ c)),
hence d1d1 = d1d2 by axiom (i).
38
On the second component ( r= 2) one gets:
d1d1(2; a⊗ b⊗ c) = d1(1; (a≻ b) ⊗ c) = (1; ( a≻ b) ≺ c),
d1d2(2; a⊗ b⊗ c) = d1(2; a⊗ (b≺ c)) = (1; a≻ (b≺ c)),
hence d1d1 = d1d2 by axiom (ii).
On the third component ( r= 3) one gets:
d1d1(3; a⊗ b⊗ c) = d1(2; (a∗ b) ⊗ c) = (1; ( a∗ b) ≻ c),
d1d2(3; a⊗ b⊗ c) = d1(2; a⊗ (b≻ c)) = (1; a≻ (b≻ c)),
hence d1d1 = d1d2 by axiom (iii).
Higher up, the veriﬁcation of didj = dj−1di splits up into two diﬀerent
cases. First, if j = i+ 1, then it is the same kind of computation as above, so it
is a consequence of the axioms of a dendriform algebra. Secon d, if j >i+1, then
both operations agree on Cn (direct checking) and the image of ( a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an)
is, in both cases,
(a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ai ◦r
i ai+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ aj ◦r
j aj+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an).
6.3. The chain bicomplex of a dendriform algebra. Observe that
CDend
∗ (E) is in fact the total complex of a bicomplex. Indeed, let
CDend
p,q (E) = {p}E⊗p+q for p≥ 1,q ≥ 0.
The map
dh : CDend
p,q (E) → CDend
p−1,q(E) by dh :=
p−1∑
i=1
(−1)idi,
is well-deﬁned because di(p) = p− 1, when i≤ p− 1, and
dv : CDend
p,q (E) → CDend
p,q−1(E) by dv :=
p+q∑
i=p
(−1)idi.
is well-deﬁned because di(p) = p, when i≥ p. In other words, the p-th compo-
nent of CDend
n (E) is put in bidegree ( p,n − p).
6.4. (Co)homology of dendriform algebras. By deﬁnition the homology
(with trivial coeﬃcients) of a dendriform algebra E is
HDend
∗ (E) := H∗(CDend
∗ (E),d) ,
39
and the cohomology of a dendriform algebra E (with trivial coeﬃcients) is
H∗
Dend(E) := H∗(Hom(CDend
∗ (E),K)).
Let us use freely the interpretation of the preceding result s in terms of operads
as devised in the next section. From Koszul duality and Appen dix B5d, the
graded module H∗
Dend(E) is naturally equipped with a structure of graded
dialgebra (and hence a structure of graded Leibniz algebra) .
6.5. Theorem. The dendriform algebra homology of a free dendriform algebr a
is trivial. More precisely
HDend
n (Dend(V)) = 0 for n> 0,
HDend
1 (Dend(V)) = V.
Proof. Since we know already that the analogous theorem for associa tive di-
algebras is true (Theorem 3.8), it is a consequence (by the op erad theory, cf.
Appendix B), of the operad duality between Dias and Dend proved in Propo-
sition 8.3.

7. ZINBIEL ALGEBRAS, DENDRIFORM ALGEBRAS AND HO-
MOLOGY
In this section we introduce Zinbiel (i.e. dual-Leibniz) al gebras and we
compare them with dendriform algebras. In particular we com pute the natural
map from a free dendriform algebra to the free Zinbiel algebr a, considered as
a dendriform algebra. Finally we compare the homology theor ies.
7.1. Zinbiel algebras [L3]. A Zinbiel algebra R (*) (also called dual-Leibniz
algebra) is a module over K equipped with a binary operation ( x,y) ↦→x· y,
which satisﬁes the identity
(7.1.1) ( x· y) · z= x· (y· z) + x· (z· y) , for all x,y,z ∈ R.
The category of Zinbiel algebras is denoted Zinb. The free Zinbiel algebra over
the vector space V is
T(V) = ⊕n≥1V⊗n equipped with the following product
(x0 ...x p) · (xp+1 ...x p+q) = x0shp,q(x1 ...x p+q)
where shp,q is the sum over all ( p,q)-shuﬄes. We denote it by Zinb(V). Observe
that Zinb(V) = ⨁
nZinb(n) ⊗Sn V⊗n for Zinb(n) = K[Sn]. It is immediate
to check that the symmetrized product
(7.1.2) xy:= x· y+ y· x
is associative (cf. [R], [L3]), so, under the symmetrized pr oduct, Rbecomes an
associative and commutative algebra. This construction gi ves a functor
Zinb
+
− →Com.
Let us construct functors to and from the category of dendrif orm algebras
Dend.
7.2. Lemma. Let R be a Zinbiel algebra and put
x≺ y:= x· y , x≻ y:= y· x ,∀ x,y ∈ R.
Then (R,≺,≻) is a dendriform algebra denoted RDend. Conversely, a commu-
tative dendriform algebra (i.e. a dendriform algebra for wh ich x≻ y= y≺ x)
is a Zinbiel algebra.
Proof. Indeed, relation (i) is exactly relation (3.3.1) and so is re lation (iii).
Relation (ii) also follows from (3.3.1) since
x≻ (y≺ z) = ( yz)x, (x≻ y) ≺ z = ( yx)z,
(*) Terminology proposed by J.-M. Lemaire
41
and the relation ( y· z) · x= ( y· x) · z follows from (3.3.1) for y,z,x and y,x,z .
So we have constructed a functor
Zinb → Dend.
From Lemma 5.2 we get a functor
Dend
+
− →As.
Summarizing we get the following
7.4. Proposition. The following diagram of functors between categories of
algebras is commutative
Zinb֒→Dend
↓+ ↓+
Com֒→As
Proof. The commutativity of the diagram is immediate since for a Zi nbiel
algebra the associated associative products are equal :
x∗ y= x≺ y+ x≻ y= x· y+ y· x= xy .
7.5. Theorem. For any vector space V, the natural map of dendriform
algebras Dend(V) → Zinb(V)Dend is induced, in degree n, by the map
K[Yn] ⊗ K[Sn] → K[Sn], y ⊗ ω↦→
∑
{σ∈Sn | ψ′(σ)=y}
σω ,
where ψ′ : Sn→ →Yn is the surjective map described in Appendix A6.
Proof. First, observe that the map V → Zinb(V) gives a map (the same on
the underlying vector spaces) V → Zinb(V)Dend. Since this latter object is a
dendriform algebra, the map factors through the free dendri form algebra on V,
whence a natural dialgebra map φ: Dend(V) → Zinb(V)Dend.
The proof will be done by induction on n.
Restricting φto the degree npart gives a commutative square (cf. 5.8 and
5.9):
K[Yn] ⊗ V⊗n φn
− → V⊗n
⋂ ⋂
Dend(V)
φ
− → Zinb(V)Dend .
42
For n= 1, φ1 is clearly the identity of V.
For n= 2, φ2 : K[Y2] ⊗ V⊗2 → V⊗2 is given by

⊗ (x,y,z ) = ( z≻ y) ≻ x↦→x· (y· z) = [321] .(x,y,z ),
so the map is precisely ψ′.
Let us now prove it for any n. We suppose that the theorem has been
proved for any p < n. We are going to prove it for n. We use the grafting
operation on trees (cf. Appendix A).
The element ( y1 ∨ y2; x1 ...x p+q+1) can be written as
(y1; x1 ...x p) ≻ xp+1 ≺ (y2; xp+2 ...x p+q+1)
in Dend(V) when p ≥ 1,q ≥ 1. Here xp+1 stands for ([1]; xp+1). We do
not need to put any parenthesis because of the second relatio n of dendriform
algebras. The image of this element under φ is
(xp+1 · φq(y2; xp+2 ...x p+q+1)) · φp(y1; x1 ...x p+q+1)
= xp+1 · (φq(y2; xp+2 ...x p+q+1) · φp(y1; x1 ...x p+q+1)
+φp(y1; x1 ...x p+q+1) · φq(y2; xp+2 ...x p+q+1)).
By induction we know that φp(y1; x1 ...x p) = ∑
σ1∈ψ′−1(y1) σ1(x1 ...x p) and
that φq(y2; xp+2 ...x p+q+1) = ∑
σ2∈ψ′−1(y2) σ2(xp+2 ...x p+q+1). For zi ∈ V
one has, in the free Zinbiel algebra, the equality
z0 · (z1 ...z p · zp+1 ...z p+q + zp+1 ...z p+q · z1 ...z p) =
∑
τ
τ(z0 ...z p+q),
where the sum is extended over all the ( p,q)-shuﬄes τ (acting on the set
{1,...,p + q}. Hence we get
φn(y1 ∨ y2; x1 ...x n) =
∑
π
π(x1 ...x n),
43
where the permutation π is of the following form :
π(i) = τσ1(i) for 1 ≤ i≤ p,
π(p+ 1) = 1 ,
π(i) = τ(p+ σ2(i)) for p+ 2 ≤ i≤ p+ q+ 1,
where σ1 ∈ ψ′−1(y1), σ2 ∈ ψ′−1(y2) and τ is a ( p,q)-shuﬄe.
On the other hand one easily checks that all the permutations σ which
belong to ψ′−1(y1 ∨ y2) are precisely obtained by choosing such a σ1 and such
a σ2, and then shuﬄe the associated levels. So we have proved the f ormula for
n.
In the preceding proof we assumed that p≥ 1,q ≥ 1. We let to the reader
the task of modifying the proof when either p= 0 or q= 0.
7.6. Comparison of homology theories. As mentioned in Appendix B, for
any algebra over a Koszul operad, there is a small chain compl ex, modelled on
the dual operad, whose homology is the homology of the algebr a. For Zinbiel
algebras it takes the following form (cf. [Li2]):
CZinb
∗ (R) : · · · − → R⊗n d
− →R⊗n−1 d
− → · · ·
d
− →R⊗2 ·
− →R
where
d(x1,...,x n) = ( x1 · x2,x3,...,x n) +
n−1∑
i=2
(−1)i−1(x1,...,x i ∗ xi+1,...,x n).
The homology groups of this complex are denoted HZinb
n (R), for n ≥ 1. By
Appendix B5e, there is a natural map of complexes
CDend
∗ (RDend) − →CZinb
∗ (R)
inducing
HDend
∗ (RDend) − →HZinb
∗ (R).
Let us describe explicitly the chain complex map.
7.7. Proposition. Let θr
n ∈ K[Sn] be the elements deﬁned recursively by the
formulas :
θ1
1(1) = (1) , θ r
n(1,...,n ) = ( r,˜θr
n(1,..., ˆr...,n ),
˜θr
n(1,...,n − 1) = ( r− 1,˜θr−1
n−1(1,..., ˆr− 1 ...,n ) + ( r,˜θr
n−1(1,..., ˆr...,n ).
In particular, θ1
n(1,...,n ) = (1 ,...,n ) and θn
n(1,...,n ) = ( n,..., 1). The map
Θ n : K[Cn] ⊗ R⊗n → R⊗n deﬁned by
Θ n([r] ⊗ (x1,· · · xn)) := θr
n(x1,· · · xn)
is the chain complex map Θ ∗ : CDend
∗ (RDend) − → CZinb
∗ (R) induced by the
operad morphism Dend→ Zinb.
Proof. This is a consequence of the explicit description of the morp hism of
Leibniz algebras Leib(V) → Dias(V)Leib, cf. Appendix B5e.
Observe that θr
n is the sum of the signed action of ( n
r) permutations. Since∑ (n
r) = 2 n, we recover (up to permutation) the 2 n monomials of [ x1,[x2,[...,x n]]]
(cf. 4.10).

8. KOSZUL DUALITY FOR THE DIALGEBRA OPERAD
In this section we show that the operad associated to dendrif orm algebras
is dual, in the operadic sense, to the operad associated to di algebras. Moreover
we use the results of section 4 to show that the operad of assoc iative dialgebras
is a Koszul operad (and so is the operad of dendriform algebra s). The reader
not familiar with the notions of operad and Koszul duality ma y have a look at
Appendix B, from which we take the notation.
8.1. The associative dialgebra operad. A dialgebra is determined by two
operations (left and right product) on two variables and by r elations which
make use of the composition of two such operations. Hence the operad Dias
associated to the notion of dialgebra is a binary (operation s on two variables)
quadratic (relations involving two operations) operad. Mo reover, there is no
symmetry property for these operations, and, in the relatio ns, the variables
stay in the same order. Hence the operad is a non-Σ -operad, that is, as a
representation of Sn, the space Dias(n) is a sum of copies of the regular
representation. It was proved in 2.5 that the free dialgebra over the vec-
tor space V is Dias(V) = T(V) ⊗ V ⊗ T(V). The degree n part of it is⨁
i+1+j=nV⊗i ⊗ V ⊗ V⊗j. Hence the operad Dias is such that
Dias(n) = nK[Sn] ( n copies of the regular representation) .
In particular Dias(1) = K (the only unary operation on a dialgebra is the
identity), E := Dias(2) = E′ ⊗ K[S2], where E′ is 2-dimensional generated
by ⊣ and ⊢. The space Ind S3
S2 (E ⊗ E) is the sum of 8 copies of the regular
representation of S3. Each copy corresponds to a choice of parenthesizing:
(− ◦ 1 (− ◦ 2 −)) or (( − ◦ 1 −) ◦2 −), and a choice for the two operations ◦1
and ◦2. The space of relations R ⊂ Ind S3
S2 (E⊗ E) is of the form R′ ⊗ K[S3],
where R′ is the subspace of E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2 determined by the relations 1 to 5 of
a dialgebra (cf. 2.1).
8.2. The dendriform algebra operad. Analogously the operad Dend
associated to the notion of dendriform algebra is binary and quadratic, and
is a non-Σ -operad since there is no symmetry for the operations and, in the
relations, the variables stay in the same order. It was prove d in 5.7 that the free
dendriform algebra over the vector space V is Dend(V) = ⨁
n≥1 K[Yn] ⊗ V⊗n.
Hence the operad Dend is such that
Dend(n) = K[Yn] ⊗ K[Sn].
In particular Dend(1) = K,Dend(2) = F′ ⊗ K[S2], where F′ is 2-dimensional
generated by ≺ and ≻. The space
Ind S3
S2 (Dend(2) ⊗ Dend(2)) ∼
= (F′⊗2 ⊕ F′⊗2) ⊗ K[S3]
is the sum of 8 copies of the regular representation of S3. The space of relations
is of the form S′ ⊗K[S3], where S′ ⊂ (F′⊗2 ⊕F′⊗2) is the subspace determined
by the 3 relations of a dendriform algebra (cf. 5.1).
45
8.3. Proposition. The operad Dend of dendriform algebras is dual, in the
operad sense, to the operad Dias of dialgebras : Dias! = Dend.
Proof. Let us identify F′ = E′∨ with E′ by identifying the basis ( ≺,≻) with the
basis ( ⊣,⊢). Since R= R′ ⊗ K[S3], the space of relations for the dual operad
is of the form R′ann ⊗ K[S3], where, according to Proposition B3, R′ann is
the annihilator of R′. Recall from Proposition B3 that the scalar product on
E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2 is given by the matrix
[
Id 0
0 − Id
]
.
With obvious notation, the subspace R′ is determined by the relations









(⊣,⊣)2 − (⊣,⊣)1 = 0 ,
(⊣,⊣)1 − (⊣,⊢)2 = 0 ,
(⊢,⊣)1 − (⊢,⊣)2 = 0 ,
(⊣,⊢)1 − (⊢,⊢)2 = 0 ,
(⊢,⊢)2 − (⊢,⊢)1 = 0 .
It is immediate to verify that its annihilator R′⊥ with respect to the given
scalar product is the subspace determined by the relations



(⊣,⊣)1 − (⊣,⊣)2 − (⊣,⊢)2 = 0 ,
(⊢,⊣)1 − (⊢,⊣)2 = 0 ,
(⊢,⊢)2 − (⊣,⊢)1 − (⊢,⊢)1 = 0 .
This is precisely the relations of dendriform algebras (onc e we have changed ⊣
into ≺ and ⊢ into ≻).
8.4. Proposition. The chain complex CY∗(D) associated to a dialgebra D is
the chain complex of D in the operad sense (cf. Appendix B4). Hence HY is
the (co)homology theory for dialgebras predicted by the ope rad theory.
Proof. From the theory of operads recalled in Appendix B we have
CDias
n (D) = Dend(n)∨ ⊗Sn D⊗n.
By Proposition 5.7 we get
CDias
n (D) = K[Yn] ⊗ K[Sn] ⊗Sn D⊗n = K[Yn] ⊗ D⊗n = CYn(D).
So, it suﬃces to prove that the boundary operator d of CY∗(D) agrees with
the dialgebra structure of D on CY2(D) and that it is a coalgebra derivation.
The boundary map on CY2(D) = D⊗2 ⊕ D⊗2 is given by x⊗ y ↦→x⊣ y
on the ﬁrst component and by x⊗ y ↦→x⊢ y on the second one. So the ﬁrst
condition is fulﬁlled. Checking the coderivation property is analogous to the
associative case (cf. B4).
8.5. Theorem. The operad Dias of dialgebras is a Koszul operad, and so is
the operad Dend of dendriform algebras.
46
Proof. From the deﬁnition of a Koszul operad given in B4, this theore m follows
from the vanishing of HDias
∗ = HY∗ of a free dialgebra, as proved in Theorem
3.8. Since P being Koszul implies P! is Koszul (cf. Appendix B5b), the operad
Dend is Koszul.
Observe that this theorem, together with the general proper ty of Koszul
operads recalled in B4a, implies proposition 5.2.
8.6. Poincar´ e series. From the description of the operad Dias it follows
that its Poincar´ e series is
gDias(x) =
∑
n≥1
(−1)nnn!xn
n! =
∑
n≥1
(−1)nnxn = −x
(1 + x)2 .
On the other hand, the Poincar´ e series of Dend is
gDend(x) =
∑
n≥1
(−1)ncnn!xn
n! =
∑
n≥1
(−1)ncnxn = −1 − 2x+ √1 + 4 x
2x .
As expected (cf. Appendix B5c) we verify that gDend(gDias(x)) = x.
8.7. Operad morphisms. Any morphism of operads induces a functor be-
tween the associated categories of algebras. Taking the dua l gives also a mor-
phism, but in the other direction. For instance the dual of th e inclusion of
the category of commutative algebras into the category of as sociative algebras
is the “-” functor which transforms an associative algebra i nto a Lie algebra.
All the functors between categories of algebras that we met i n the previous
sections come from morphisms of operads. They assemble into the following
commutative diagram of functors (cf. Proposition 4.4 and Pr oposition 7.4):
Dend Dias
incր + ց incր − ց
Zinb As Leib
+ ց incր − ց incր
Com Lie
The symmetry (around a vertical axis passing through As! = As) reﬂects
the Koszul duality of quadratic operads : Lie! = Com,Dias! = Dend,Leib! =
Zinb.

9. STRONG HOMOTOPY ASSOCIATIVE DIALGEBRAS
Strong homotopy P-algebras are governed by the Koszul dual operad P!
(cf. Appendix B6). Since for Dias we know of an explicit description of its
dual Dias!, we are able to describe explicitly the notion of strong homotopy
dialgebra. In order to do it we use the notion of nested sub-tree of a plan ar
binary tree.
9.1. Nested sub-trees. Recall that in section 5 we deﬁned the notion of
nested sub-tree y′ of a tree y with quotient y′′ = y/y′ and we described com-
position in the free dendriform algebra in terms of nested su b-trees, cf. 5.10
and Proposition 5.11.
9.2. Theorem. A strong homotopy dialgebra is a graded vector space A =
⊕i∈ZAi equipped with operations
my : A⊗n → A, for any y∈ Yn, n≥ 1,
which are homogeneous of degree n−2 and which satisfy the following relations
for any y:
(∗)y
∑
y′⊂y, y′′=y/y′
±my′′ (a1,...,a i,my′ (ai+1,...,a i+k),...,a n) = 0 ,
where the sign ± is + or − according to the parity of (k+ 1)( i+ 1) + k(n+∑ k
j=1 |aj|).
In this relation the tree y is ﬁxed and the sum runs over all the nested
sub-trees y′ of y with y′′ = y/y′ (as described in 5.10).
Compare with the deﬁnition of a A∞-algebra [St, p. 294].
Proof. Since the operad Dias is Koszul (cf. Theorem 8.5), we may apply The-
orem B.7. By Proposition 5.8 the dual operad Dend is generated in dimension
n (as a free Sn-module) by the set of n-trees Yn. Hence the operations on a
B(P!)∗-algebra A are generated by operations my, for y∈ Yn,
my : A⊗|y| → A of degree |y| − 2.
The relations satisﬁed by these operations are obtained as f ollows. First one
extends them in order to get a coderivation
m: ⊕nK[Yn] ⊗ A⊗n − → ⊕nK[Yn] ⊗ A⊗n,
and then one writes m◦ m= 0. The component in K[Y1] ⊗ A= Aof the image
under m of an element K{y} ⊗ A⊗n ⊂ K[Yn] ⊗ A⊗n is given by my (up to
sign). More precisely we put
my(a1,· · · ,an) := ( −1)(k−1)|a1|+(k−2)|a2|+···ak−1 m(y; a1,· · · ,an)1.
48
In order to obtain the component in K{y′} ⊗ A⊗k we need to look at the com-
position in the cofree co-dendriform algebra, or dually, in the free dendriform
algebra:
Dias!(k) ⊗ Dias!(i1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Dias!(ik) − →Dias!(i1 + · · · + ik)
or equivalently,
K[Yk] ⊗ K[Yi1 ] ⊗ · · · ⊗ K[Yik ] − →K[Yi1+···+ik ].
It is suﬃcient to write the relation m◦m= 0 for the component in K[Y1]⊗A=
Aof the image, since the vanishing of the other components is a consequence of
that one. Hence it is suﬃcient to compute the composition pro duct for iu = 1
for all iu except one of them, let us say ij = m. In this case it is precisely the
result of Proposition 5.11.
9.3. Strong homotopy associative dialgebra in low dimensio ns. Let
us write my = mij···k in place of m[ij···k], when y= [ ij· · · k].
For n= 1 the operation δ := m1 : A→ A is of degree −1. Since the only
nested sub-tree of [1] is [1] itself, the relation ( ∗)1 is
δ◦ δ= 0 .
Hence ( A,δ) is a chain complex.
For n = 2, there are two maps m12 and m21 : A⊗2 → A, which are of
degree 0. The tree [12] (resp. [21]) has three nested sub-tre es, itself with
quotient [1], and two (diﬀerent) copies of [1], both with quo tient [12] (resp.
[21]). Hence the relation ( ∗)12 takes the form (where 1 stands for Id):
δ◦ m12 − m12 ◦ (δ⊗ 1) − m12 ◦ (1 ⊗ δ) = 0 ,
and similarly for [21]. In other words δ is a derivation for m12 and for m21.
For n= 3, there are ﬁve maps A⊗3 → A, denoted m123,m213,m131,m312,m321,
corresponding to the ﬁve trees of Y3. The ﬁve relations ( ∗)y for ya tree of degree
3 are:
δ◦ m123 + m123 ◦ (δ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ δ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ δ) =
m12 ◦ (m12 ⊗ 1) − m12 ◦ (1 ⊗ m12),
δ◦ m213 + m213 ◦ (δ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ δ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ δ) =
m12 ◦ (m21 ⊗ 1) − m12 ◦ (1 ⊗ m12),
δ◦ m131 + m131 ◦ (δ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ δ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ δ) =
m21 ◦ (m12 ⊗ 1) − m12 ◦ (1 ⊗ m21),
δ◦ m312 + m312 ◦ (δ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ δ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ δ) =
m21 ◦ (m21 ⊗ 1) − m21 ◦ (1 ⊗ m12),
δ◦ m321 + m321 ◦ (δ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ δ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ δ) =
m21 ◦ (m21 ⊗ 1) − m21 ◦ (1 ⊗ m21).
One observes that, as expected, if all the maps mijk are trivial (and also
higher up), then m12 = ⊢ , m21 = ⊣ , and the algebra is a graded dialgebra.

Appendix A. PLANAR BINARY TREES AND PERMUTATIONS.
A.1. Planar binary trees. A planar tree is binary if any vertex is trivalent.
We denote by Yn the set of planar binary trees with n vertices, that is with
n+1 leaves (and one root). Since we only use planar binary tree s in this section
we abbreviate it into tree (or n-tree). The integer nis called the degree of the
tree. For any y ∈ Yn we label the n+ 1 leaves by {0,1,...,n } from left to
right. We label the vertices by {1,...,n } so that the i-th vertex is in between
the leaves i− 1 and i. In low dimension these sets are:
Y0 = {|}, Y1 = {

}.
The number of elements in Yn is cn = (2n)!
n!(n+1)! , so c = (1 ,2,5,14,42,132,... )
is the sequence of the Catalan numbers.
We ﬁrst introduce a notation for these trees as follows. The o nly element
| of Y0 is denoted by [0]. The only element of Y1 is denoted by [1].
The grafting of a p-tree y1 and a q-tree y2 is a ( p+ q+ 1)-tree denoted by
y1 ∨ y2 obtained by joining the roots of y1 and y2 and creating a new root from
that vertex.
y1 ∨ y2 =
❅
❅
❅❅
 
 
  
y1 y2
Its name is written [ y1 p+q+1 y2 ] with the convention that all 0’s are deleted
(except for the element in Y0). For instance one has: [0] ∨ [0] = [1] , [1] ∨ [0] =
[12], [0] ∨ [1] = [21] , [1] ∨ [1] = [131], and so on. So the names of the trees
pictured above are, from left to right:
[0] ,[1] ,[12] ,[21] ,[123] ,[213] ,[131] ,[312] ,[321] .
This labelling has several advantages. For instance if we dr aw the tree metri-
cally, with the leaves regulary spaced, and the lines at 45 de gree angle, then
the integers in the sequence are precisely the depth of the su ccessive vertices.

The orientation of the leaves can be read from the name as foll ows. Let
y= [ a1 ...an]. The i-th leaf is oriented SW-NE (resp. SE-NW) when ai <ai+1
(resp. ai >ai+1).
The following is an inductive criterion to check whether a se quence of
integers is the name of a tree.
50
A.2. Proposition. A sequence of positive integers [a1 ... an] is the name of
a tree if and only if it satisﬁes the following conditions:
– there is a unique integer p such that ap = n,
– the two sequences a1...ap−1 and ap+1...an are either empty or name of
trees.
Proof. It suﬃces to remark that any tree y is of the form y1 ∨ y2 for two
uniquely determined trees y1 and y2, whose degree is strictly smaller than the
degree of y.
A.3. From permutations to trees. There is deﬁned a surjective map
ψ: Sn→ →Yn
as follows. The image of {1,...,n } under the permutation σ is a sequence
of positive integers [ σ1 ... σn]. We convert it into the name of a tree by the
following inductive rule. Replace the largest integer in th e interval σ1 ...σn, say
σp, by the length of the interval (which is nhere). Then repeat the modiﬁcation
for the intervals σ1 ... σp−1 and σp+1 ... σn, and so on, until each integer has
been modiﬁed. This gives the name of a tree (hence a tree), sin ce it obviously
satisﬁes the above criterion. Let us perform this construct ion on an example,
where the successive modiﬁcations are underlined:
σ= [341652] ↦→[341652] ↦→[331622] ↦→[131621] = ψ(σ).
A.4. Planar binary increasing trees. Let us introduce a variation of trees:
the planar binary trees with levels also called increasing trees in the literature.
A tree with levels is an n-tree together with a given level for each vertex. This
level takes value in {1,...,n }, and we suppose that each vertex has a diﬀerent
level, and that the levels are increasing, that is they respe ct the partial order
structure of the tree (the level is the depth of the vertex).
Example: the following are two distinct increasing trees

We denote by ˜Yn the set of increasing n-trees.
The following is a well-known result which was brought to my a ttention
by Phil Hanlon [Ha].
A.5. Proposition. The map which assigns a level to each vertex determines
a permutation. This gives a bijection ˜Yn ∼
= Sn between increasing trees and
permutations.
51
Proof. Label the vertices by their right leaf (i.e. vertex iis in between the
leaf i− 1 and the leaf i). Since each vertex has a diﬀerent level it is clear that
we get a bijection. So any increasing tree gives rise to a perm utation.
On the other hand a permutation gives rise to a tree under ψ, cf. A3.
Labelling the level of the i-th vertex by σ(i) gives an increasing tree.
It is immediately seen that the two constructions are invers e to each other.
Hence the map ψ: Sn→ Yn is the composite of the bijection from the set
of permutations to the set of increasing trees with the forge tful map (forgetting
about the levels).
In low dimension ψ is given by:
σ [12] [21] [123] [213] [132] [231] [312] [321]
ψ(σ) [12] [21] [123] [213] [131] [131] [312] [321]

A.6. The other choice ψ′ to code trees. It is sometimes useful to code the
vertices of a planar binary trees by height rather than by depth. The resulting
map ψ′ : Sn → Yn is related by the formula
ψ′(σ) = ψ(ωσω−1), for ω = [ n· · · 2 1] .
For instance
ψ′([12]) =

.
A.7. Geometric interpretation of ψ. The map ψ can be considered as the
restriction to the vertices of a cellular map between polyto pes. Indeed, starting
from the set < n >= {1,...,n } let us deﬁne a poset as follows. An element
of the poset is an ordered partition of < n >. The element X is less than
the element Y if Y can be obtained from X by reuniting successive subsets.
For instance {(35)(2)(14)(7)(6)} < {(235)(14)(67)}. Note that the minimal
elements are precisely the permutations. It can be shown tha t if we exclude
the trivial partition {(12...n)} from the poset, then the geometric realization is
homeomorphic to the sphere Sn−2 (it is called the permutohedron).
Similarly, starting with planar trees with n interior vertices one deﬁnes a
poset as follows: a tree x is less than a tree y if y can be obtained from x by
scratching some interior edges. Note that the minimal eleme nts are precisely
the planar binary trees. It can be shown that if we exclude the trivial tree with
only one vertex from the poset, then the geometric realizati on is a polytope
homeomorphic to the sphere Sn−2 (it is called the Stasheﬀ polytope, or the
associahedron). The map ψ described above can be obviously extended to
a map of posets, and its geometric realization is a homotopy e quivalence of

Appendix B. ALGEBRAIC OPERADS
In this short appendix we brieﬂy survey Koszul duality for al gebraic oper-
ads as studied by Ginzburg and Kapranov [GK] and Getzler-Jon es [GJ].
The ground ﬁeld K is supposed to be of characteristic zero. The category
of ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces over K is denoted by Vect. When V is
graded its suspension sV is such that ( sV)n = Vn−1.
B.1. Algebraic operads . For a given “type of algebra” P (for instance
associative algebras, or Lie algebras, etc ...), let P(V) be the free algebra over
the vector space V. One can view P as a functor from the category Vect
to itself, which preserves ﬁltered limits. The map V → P (V) gives a natural
transformation Id → P . The functor P is analytical. In characteristic zero it
is equivalent (by Schur’s lemma) to: P is of the form
(B.1.1) P(V) =
⨁
n≥0
P(n) ⊗Sn V⊗n,
for some right Sn-module P(n).
From the universal property of the free algebra applied to Id : P(V) →
P(V) one gets a natural map P(P(V)) → P (V), that is a transformation of
functors γ : P ◦ P → P . By universality property of the free algebra functor,
one sees that the operation γ is associative and has a unit.
In order to make precise the notion of “type of algebras”, one axiomatizes
the above properties and puts up the following deﬁnition.
By deﬁnition an algebraic operad over a characteristic zero ﬁeld is an an-
alytical functor P : Vect → Vect, such that P(0) = 0, equipped with a
natural transformation of functor γ : P ◦ P → P which is associative and has
a unit 1 : Id → P . In other words ( P,γ, 1) is a monad in the tensor category
(Funct,◦), where Funct is the category of analytical functors from Vect to
itself, and ◦ stands for composition of functors.
By deﬁnition a P-algebra (that is an algebra over the operad P) is a vector
space Aequipped with a map γA : P(A) → Acompatible with the composition
γ in the following sense: the diagram
P(P(A))
P(γA)
− → P (A)
↓ γ(A) ↓ γA
P(A)
γA
− → A
is commutative.
By writing P(V) and P ◦ P (V) in terms of the vector spaves P(n)’s we see
that the operation γ is determined by linear maps
P(n) ⊗ P (i1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ P (in) − → P(i1 + · · · + in)
53
which satisfy some axioms deduced from the Sn-module structure of P(n) and
from the associativity of γ (cf. for instance [M]).
From this point of view, a P-algebra is determined by linear maps
P(n) ⊗Sn A⊗n → A
satisfying compatibility properties (cf. [M]). Observe th at the space P(n) is
the space of all operations that can be performed on n variables.
The family of Sn-modules {P(n)}n≥1 is called an S-module. There is an
obvious forgetful functor from operads to S-modules. The left adjoint functor
exists and gives rise to the free operad over an S-module (cf. for instance
[BJT]).
We are only dealing here with binary operads, that is operads generated by
operations on two variables. More explicitly, let E be an S2-module (module
of generating operations) and let T (E) be the free operad on the S-module
(0,E, 0,... ).
The ﬁrst components of T (E) are
T (E)(1) = K,
T (E)(2) = E,
T (E)(3) = Ind S3
S2 (E⊗ E) = 3 E⊗ E,
where the action of S2 on E ⊗ E is on the second factor only. Explicitly,
T (E)(3) is the space of all the operations on 3 variables that can be performed
out of the operations on 2 variables in E.
A binary operad is quadratic if it is the quotient of T (E) (for some S2-
module E) by the ideal generated by some S3-submodule R of T (E)(3). The
associated operad is denoted P(E,R).
For instance, for P = As, one has E = K[S2], the regular representation,
and so Ind S3
S2 (E⊗ E) = K[S3] ⊕ K[S3]. Labelling the generators of the ﬁrst
summand by xi(xjxk) and the generators of the second summand by ( xixj)xk,
the space Ris the subspace generated by all the elements xi(xjxk) − (xixj)xk.
All the operads Com,Lie,As,Pois,Leib,Zinb,Dias,Dend are binary and
quadratic. For all these cases the operadic notion of algebr a coincides with the
one we started with.
B.2. Dual operad. For any right Sn-module V we denote by V∨ the right
Sn-module V∗ ⊗ (sgn), where ( sgn) is the one-dimensional signature represen-
tation. Explicitly, if σf is given by σf(x) = f(xσ), then fσ = sgn(σ)(σ−1
f).
The pairing between V∨ and V given by:
<−,− >: V∨ ⊗ V − →K, <f,x> = f(x),
is sign-invariant, that is <f σ,xσ >= sgn(σ) <f,x> .
54
To any quadratic binary operad P = P(E,R) is associated its dual operad
P! deﬁned as follows. Since E is an S2-module, so is E∨. There is a canonical
isomorphism
T (E∨)(3) = Ind S3
S2 (E∨ ⊗ E∨) ∼
= (Ind S3
S2 (E⊗ E))∨ = T (E)(3)∨,
and one deﬁnes the orthogonal space of R as
R⊥ := Ker ( T (E∨)(3) → R∨).
By deﬁnition one puts
P! := P(E∨,R⊥).
It is shown in [GK] that As! = As, Com! = Lie, Lie! = Com. The
notation Zinb indicates that the operad of Zinbiel algebras is precisely t he
dual, in the above sense, of the operad of Leibniz algebras (c f. [L3]). It is
proved in section 6 that the operad associated to dendriform algebras, denoted
Dend is the dual of the operad associated to dialgebras, as expect ed. It is a
consequence of the following proposition, which makes expl icit the dual operad
when the operations bear no symmetry. This hypothesis says t hat the space
of operations is of the form E = E′ ⊗ K[S2] for some vector space E′. Then,
the space of operations on 3 variables is T (E)(3) = ( E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2) ⊗ K[S3].
For any ξ ∈ E′ we denote by ( ξ)1 (resp. ( ξ)2 the element corresponding to an
operation of the type ( −(−−)) (resp. (( −−)−) ). The ﬁrst (resp. the second)
component of E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2 is made of the elements ( ξ)1 (resp. ( ξ)2).
B.3. Proposition. Let P be an operad whose generating operations have no
symmetry, in other words P = P(E′ ⊗ K[S2],R) for some vector space E′, and
some S3-sub-module R of (E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2) ⊗ K[S3].
The dual operad of P is
P! = P(E′ ⊗ K[S2],Rann),
where Rann is the annihilator of R for the scalar product on (E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2) ⊗
K[S3] given by
<ξ1 ⊗ σ,ξ1 ⊗ σ >= sgn( σ),
<ξ2 ⊗ σ,ξ2 ⊗ σ >= −sgn(σ),
all other scalar products are 0, where ξ1 (resp ξ2) is a basis vector of the ﬁrst
(resp. second) summand of E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2 and σ∈ S3.
Proof. Let φ : E → E∨ be the isomorphism of S2-modules deduced from the
preferred basis of E. It induces an isomorphism of S3-modules
T (φ) : T (E∨)(3) ∼
= T (E)(3).
55
Hence, the natural evaluation map T (E)(3)∨ ⊗ T (E)(3) → K gives a scalar
product T (E)(3) ⊗ T (E)(3) → K.
Suppose that E = E′ ⊗ K[S2]. Then T (E)(3) = ( E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2) ⊗ K[S3]
as mentioned above. In order to prove the Proposition, it suﬃ ces to prove
it when E′ is one-dimensional, generated by the unique product ( x1x2). The
basis of E is {(x1x2),(x2x1)}. The isomorphism φ is given by φ((x1x2)) =
(x1x2)∗,φ((x2x1)) = −(x2x1)∗. The map T (φ) sends a basis element to itself
(up to sign), so the scalar product is diagonal. Since it is si gn-invariant, it suf-
ﬁces to compute < (x1(x2x3)),(x1(x2x3)) > and < ((x1x2)x3),((x1x2)x3) >.
With the choice at hand we ﬁnd +1 in the ﬁrst case and −1 in the second.
It is clear from this Proposition that As! = As. Indeed, E′ is one dimen-
sional generated by ( · · ), and E′⊗2 ⊕ E′⊗2 is 2-dimensional generated by ( ·(· · ))
and (( · · )·). The space R is of the form R′ ⊗ K[S3] because, in the associative
relation, the variables stay in order. Since R′ is determined by the equation
(·(· · )) − ((· · )·) = 0, it is immediate to check that it is its own annihilator.
B.4. Homology and Koszul duality. Let P be a quadratic binary operad
and P! its dual operad. Let Abe a P-algebra. There is deﬁned a chain-complex
CP
∗ (A):
· · · → P !(n)∨ ⊗Sn A⊗n d
− → P!(n− 1)∨ ⊗Sn−1 A⊗n−1 → · · · → P !(1)∨ ⊗ A
where the diﬀerential dagrees, in low dimension, with the P-algebra structure
of A
γA(2) : P(2) ⊗ A⊗2 → A.
In fact d is characterized by this condition plus the fact that on the c ofree
coalgebra P!∗(sA) it is a graded coderivation. The associated homology group s
are denoted by HP
n(A), for n ≥ 1. Taking the linear dual of CP
∗ (A) over K
gives a cochain complex, which permits us to deﬁne the cohomo logy groups
Hn
P (A).
If, for any vector space V, the groups HP
n(P(V)) are trivial for n >1,
then the operad P is called a Koszul operad.
One can check that the chain-complex CP
∗ is
– the Hochschild complex (of nonunital algebras) for P = As,
– the Harrison complex (of nonunital commutative algebras) for P = Com,
– the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for P = Lie,
– the chain-complex constructed in [L1] for P = Leib,
– the chain-complex constructed in [Li2] for P = Zinb.
Let us give some details about the check in the case of nonunit al associative
algebras. Since As! = As, one has
CAs
n (A) = As!(n)∨ ⊗Sn A⊗n = K[Sn] ⊗Sn A⊗n = A⊗n.
56
Since the lowest diﬀerential coincides with the product on A, the map d2 :
A⊗2 → A is given by d2(x,y) = xy. The coalgebra structure of CAs
∗ (A) is
given by “deconcatenation”, that is
∆( a1,...,a n) =
n∑
i=0
(a1,...,a i) ⊗ (ai+1,...,a n).
Since d is a graded coderivation, we have on A⊗3
∆ d3(a1,a2,a3) = ( d2 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ d2)∆( a1,a2,a3)
= ( d2 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ d2)((a1,a2) ⊗ a3 + a1 ⊗ (a2,a3))
= ( a1a2) ⊗ a3 − a1 ⊗ (a2a3).
Hence we obtain d3(a1,a2,a3) = ( a1a2,a3) − (a1,a2a3).
More generally, the same kind of computation shows that
dn(a1,...,a n) =
n−1∑
i=1
(−1)i−1(a1,...,a iai+1,...,a n).
So ( CP
∗ (A),d) is precisely the Hochschild complex for non-unital algebr as (also
called the b′-complex in the literature, cf. [L0] for instance).
B.5. Properties of the operad dualization. Here are some properties of
the dualization of operads.
(a) Lie algebra property . Let A be a P-algebra and B be a P!-algebra. The
following bracket makes A⊗ B into a Lie algebra :
[a⊗ b,a′ ⊗ b′] :=
∑ (
µ(a,a′) ⊗ µ∨(b,b′) − µ(a′,a) ⊗ µ∨(b′,b)
)
,
where the sum is over a basis {µ} of the binary operations of P, {µ∨} being
the dual basis in P!.
(b) Koszulness. P!! = P. If P is Koszul, then so is P!.
(c) Poincar´ e series.Deﬁne the Poincar´ e series of P as
gP (x) :=
∑
n≥1
(−1)ndim P(n)xn
n! .
If P is Koszul, then the following formula holds:
gP (gP! (x)) = x.
For instance gAs(x) = −x
1+x, gComm(x) = exp( −x) − 1, gLie(x) = −log(1 + x).
57
(d) Multiplicative structure. For any P-algebra Athe homology groups HP
∗ (A)
form a graded P!-coalgebra. Equivalently, H∗
P (A) is a graded P!-algebra.
(e) Functoriality. Let φ: P → Q be a morphism of operads, inducing a functor
(Q-algebras) → (P-algebras), A↦→AP between the categories of algebras. For
any Q-algebra A there is a well-deﬁned graded morphism
φ∗ : HP
∗ (AP ) → HQ
∗ (A),
which is induced, at the complex level, by the unique morphis m of Q!-algebra
Q!(V) → P !(V)Q! ,
which commutes with the embeddings of the vector space V.
(f) Quillen homology. If P is Koszul, then the homology theory HP
∗ for P-
algebras, as deﬁned above, coincides with the Quillen homol ogy with trivial
coeﬃcients (cf. [Q], [Li3], [FM]). This is a consequence of t he existence of a
quasi-isomorphism B(P!)∗ → P (see below).
B.6. Homotopy algebras over an operad. A quasi-free resolution Q → P
of the operad P is a diﬀerential graded operad Q which is a free operad over
some graded S-module V, and such that, for all n, Q(n) is a chain-complex
whose homology is trivial, except H0 which is equal to P(n). The isomorphism
H0(Q) ∼
= P is supposed to be an isomorphism of operads. Observe that one
does not require Q to be free in the category of diﬀerential graded operads. By
deﬁnition a homotopy P-algebra is a Q-algebra for some quasi-free resolution
Q of P.
A quasi-free resolution Q over V, with augmentation ideal ¯Q is called
minimal when the diﬀerential d is quadratic, that is, satisﬁes d(V) ⊂ ¯Q · ¯Q.
For a given P such a minimal model always exists in characteristic zero an d is
unique up to homotopy.
By deﬁnition a strong homotopy P-algebra is a Q-algebra for the minimal
model Q of P.
If P is Koszul, then there is a way of constructing the minimal mod el as
follows. Let P! be the Koszul dual of P and let B(P!) be the bar-construction
over P!. It is the cofree cooperad T ′(s¯P!) equipped with the unique coderiva-
tion d which is 0 on P! and coincides with the composition on P! ◦ P !. It is
immediate that d2 = 0, and hence B(P!) := ( T ′(s¯P!),d) is a complex called
the bar-complex of P!. It is shown in [GK] (cf. also [GJ]), that, if the operad
P is Koszul, then the diﬀerential graded operad B(P!)∗ is a resolution of P.
Since it is quasi-free and since the diﬀerential mof B(P!)∗ is quadratic, B(P!)∗
is the minimal model of P.
B.7. Theorem. For a Koszul operad P, strong homotopy P-algebras are
equivalent to B(P!)∗-algebras.
58
B.8. Strong homotopy associative algebras. The associative operad
P = As is Koszul and self-dual. Since As(n) is one-dimensional as a free Sn-
module, it gives rise to a generating operation mn : A⊗n → A of the strong
homotopy associative algebra A. The condition m◦m= 0 gives, for each n≥ 1
∑
k+l=n−1
ml ◦ mk = 0 .
Hence a strong homotopy associative algebra is exactly what is called an A∞-
algebra in the literature (cf. [St]).
