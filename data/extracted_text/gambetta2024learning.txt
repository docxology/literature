As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own
outputs: a process termed "autophagy". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and
diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various
generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating
human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing
mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated.
In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a
model’s next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these
measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as
on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a
model trains on data that does not "surprise" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free
Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy:
filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods,
this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across
datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even
more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model
collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments
increasingly saturated with synthetic data.

1 Introduction
Generative AI has demonstrated remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly in conver-
sational systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini, and Meta AI [44]. These applications
have been widely adopted and now play a central role in content generation across many online
platforms [19].
Large Generative Models (LGMs) powering these applications are trained on vast amounts of
human-authored content. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on text
corpora containing up to two trillion tokens [42]. In comparison, the global pool of high-quality
human-authored text is estimated at just 17 trillion tokens, with a modest annual growth rate of
4–5% [43]. A 2021 report predicts that by 2025, 90% of internet content will be AI-generated [13],
heralding what has been described as the Age of Synthetic Realities [7]. As LGMs’ training relies
on web-sourced content, there is a rising risk that their own outputs (the AI-generated content)
will be used to train future models, creating a potentially self-consuming feedback loop [36].
Recent research has highlighted the risks associated with this self-consuming feedback loop,
often referred to as autophagy, i.e., a process where generative AI models are recursively fine-tuned
on their own outputs [35, 36, 45]. The autophagy process leads to a phenomenon known as model
collapse, characterized by a significant loss of diversity in AI-generated content. Several factors
influence model collapse, including model size, fine-tuning parameters, and the composition of
the training set (see, e.g., [1, 20, 39]). Our understanding of model collapse is a work in progress:
Schaeffer et al. [37] note that there are many alternative definitions of model collapse as well as
many open questions. In this paper, we address three key gaps in the current understanding and
mitigation of model collapse.
(1) Model collapse is standardly diagnosed through metrics computed on the AI-generated
content. We lack a principled way to characterise model collapsein relation to the model itself
(i.e., based on the probabilities it produces), independently of its outputs.
(2) While fine-tuning on AI-generated content is known to induce collapse, we lack a principled
account of which properties of training documents make them more likely to trigger it.
(3) Existing strategies to mitigate model collapse assume that we can distinguish between human-
authored and AI-generated content. This assumption is increasingly unrealistic, especially as
AI-generated content proliferates online.
Our paper, which focuses on LLMs, aims to connect these three open issues. In response to (1),
we propose novel measures for characterising model collapse based on the model’s next-token
probability distributions, rather than the properties of AI-generated text documents. We define a
model as collapsed when its predicted distributions are skewed – that is, when the model assigns
disproportionate probability mass to a small number of tokens. This skewedness is quantified with
two complementary measures: the Gini coefficient of the next-token probability distribution, and
an indicator of whether the top-token probability approaches the entire mass.
Using these new measures, we address issue (2) by proposing a new definition of the types of
documents that contribute to model collapse. We argue that the key factor is the model’s surprise:
documents that fail to surprise the model are more likely to induce collapse. To formalise this, we
introduce surplexity – a measure of how surprised a model is by a given document – as a core
criterion for identifying collapse-inducing training data.
We then use surplexity to address issue (3): we propose to mitigate model collapse by selecting
training documents by the level of surprise they elicit . Our results show, for several datasets and
LLMs, that the surplexity-based strategy is as effective in mitigating model collapse as approaches
that rely on human-authored content – and even more effective at reducing distributional skew –
while requiring no knowledge of whether training documents are human-authored or AI-generated.

Our study advances the understanding of model collapse and supports the development of more
robust generative AI systems. The surplexity-based mitigation strategy aligns with theories of
surprise-driven learning from cognitive science [16], offering a promising connection between the
study of model collapse and research on human learning mechanisms.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews related work on autophagy and
model collapse. Section 3 formalizes the model collapse problem and introduces the notation used
throughout the paper. Section 4 presents our autophagy simulation framework and implementation
details. Section 5 introduces our new proposed metrics for model collapse. Section 6 reports some
initial experiments on model collapse using the new metrics, and a new observation: collapse,
when measured by our new metric, happens at different rates for different training datasets. This
observation prompts our new proposed mitigation strategy. We describe the new strategy in
Section 7, and present some further experiments that show its effectiveness. Finally, Section 8
concludes the paper, discussing limitations and outlining directions for future research.
2 Related Work
Research on autophagy and model collapse relies on simulations because large-scale, longitudinal
empirical studies are hindered by the difficulty of tracking the many evolving versions of generative
models deployed on platforms, especially as they are frequently fine-tuned and updated over
time [35, 36]. These simulations show that model collapse occurs in both text and image domains,
affecting various generative models including LGMs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs) [1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 20, 22, 29, 30, 39].
In Shumailov et al. [ 39], model collapse is defined as a degenerative process in which data
generated by AI models contaminates the training sets of subsequent generations. The authors
illustrate this phenomenon across multiple model classes, including LLMs, VAEs, and GMMs. Since
Shumailov et al. ’s foundational work, several studies have explored variants of autophagous loops,
examining how different mixtures of human-authored and AI-generated data affect model collapse.
Alemohammad et al. [1] evaluate fully synthetic loops, synthetic augmentation, and fresh data
loops, finding that human-authored data can delay collapse but not prevent it. Martínez et al. [29]
train a generative model on a 50/50 mix of human-authored and AI-generated images. They observe
that over time, the model’s outputs become more similar to human-authored images but lose
diversity. Briesch et al. [6] compare different data cycles: a fully synthetic cycle (where training data
is entirely replaced each generation), which rapidly leads to collapse; incremental and balanced
cycles, which also reduce diversity to varying degrees; and an expanding cycle, which continuously
adds new data and successfully maintains diversity for up to 50 generations. Other studies examine
the inevitability of collapse when models are trained exclusively on AI-generated data and estimate
the minimum proportion of human-authored data required to address it [4, 38].
Guo et al. [20] introduce metrics to measure lexical, syntactic, and semantic diversity as autophagy
progresses. Studying three use cases – news summarization, scientific abstract generation, and
story generation – they find that the decline in linguistic diversity is more pronounced in tasks that
demand greater creativity. The effect of simulation parameters on model collapse has also been
investigated: Herel and Mikolov [23] show that increasing the learning rate accelerates the onset of
collapse; Suresh et al. [41] find that the time it takes for a model to forget a word is linearly related
to that word’s frequency in the original training corpus.
Several studies have investigated model collapse in the text-to-image domain. Martínez et al. [30]
use denoising diffusion implicit models and show that augmenting training data with AI-generated
images leads to a progressive decline in image quality across generations. Hataya et al. [22] study
synthetic data contamination in Stable Diffusion models and find that performance deteriorates as
the proportion of AI-generated images increases. They also propose a self-supervised method using
J. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.
111:4 Gambetta et al.
a masked autoencoder to detect AI-generated images. Bohacek and Farid [5] retrain Stable Diffusion
varying proportions of human-authored and AI-generated images, observing that collapse emerges
but can be reversed by fine-tuning solely on human-authored images. Dohmatob et al. [ 10, 11]
extend the analysis to text generation with Llama2, showing that while mixed training initially
improves performance, it eventually leads to collapse.
Another strand of research explores strategies to mitigate model collapse. Some works propose
specific accumulation-based autophagous loops to slow collapse [6, 18]. Others focus on verifying
AI-generated data before reusing it: Feng et al. [ 14] starts from the consideration that in some
cases AI-generated data can be advantageous if used in the fine-tuning of a model. They use LLMs
for specific tasks – eigenvalues prediction from a matrix and news summarization – using linear
verifiers to measure the distance between AI-generated data and ground truth information, finding
that such verification can indeed help prevent collapse. Fu et al. [ 17] study how the proportion
of human-authored versus AI-generated data affects the stability of model collapse, while Zhu et
al. [48] explore how to synthesize data in ways that avoid collapse, showing that simple token-level
edits to human-authored text (creating semi-synthetic data) can be effective. Drayson et al. [12]
propose incorporating AI-generated text detection mechanisms as a preventive strategy.
Position of our work. Existing studies mitigate model collapse by incorporating human-authored
content into the fine-tuning corpus, assuming they can be reliably distinguished from AI-generated
content. Our approach takes a different direction, starting from a key question: given a set of
text documents, what properties make them more likely to trigger collapse during fine-tuning?
This question is motivated by the observation that even repeated fine-tuning on the same human-
authored data can produce collapse-like effects, similar to those caused by AI-generated content.
Our mitigation approach is grounded in a novel characterisation of model collapse based on the
next-token probability distribution, which allows us to describe collapse in terms of the model’s
surprise. From this perspective, low-surprise documents, whether human-authored or AI-generated,
are the primary drivers of collapse. Building on this insight, we propose a mitigation strategy
that filters for high-surprise documents during fine-tuning, offering a new lens through which to
understand and mitigate model collapse.
3 The Model Collapse problem
Here, we formally introduce two fundamental concepts: the autophagy process and the model
collapse problem. These definitions are necessary as current research offers varying, and sometimes
conflicting, definitions of autophagy and model collapse [37].
Autophagy process. Let 𝑀0 be a pre-trained foundation model andD0 a dataset of human-authored
documents. The autophagy process is an iterative sequence of generation and fine-tuning steps. In
a generation step 𝑗, the model 𝑀𝑗 −1 generates a set of documents D𝑗 . In the fine-tuning step, 𝑀𝑗 −1
is fine-tuned on D𝑗 to produce the next model 𝑀𝑗 . An autophagy process of 𝑇 iterations consists
of the sequence {𝑀𝑗 −1,D𝑗 }𝑇
𝑗=1, where each model is trained on the documents it has generated.
Model collapse. Given the sequence {𝑀𝑗 −1,D𝑗 }𝑇
𝑗=1 produced by an autophagy process, let Preal
denote the true data distribution, and let P𝑗 denote the distribution implicitly defined by model
𝑀𝑗 through its generations. Let X= {𝑥1,...,𝑥 𝑚 }be a set of measurable quality dimensions (e.g.,
linguistic entropy, semantic coherence), and letΔ𝑗 (𝑥)quantify the deviation of P𝑗 from Preal along
aspect 𝑥 ∈X. We say that model collapse occurs along dimension 𝑥 ∈X when the deviation Δ𝑗 (𝑥)
increases over multiple iterations of the autophagy process:
Δ𝑗 (𝑥)> Δ𝑗 −1 (𝑥) for many 𝑗.

Learning by Surprise: Surplexity for Mitigating Model Collapse in Generative AI 111:5
In the limit, collapse may be characterized by unbounded divergence:
lim
𝑗→∞
Δ𝑗 (𝑥)= ∞ for some 𝑥 ∈X,
indicating that the model is drifting irreversibly away from desirable behavior. The function Δ𝑗 (𝑥)
may take different forms depending on the metric – for instance, drop in linguistic entropy or rise
in repetition rate.
For example, suppose that at step 𝑗 = 0, the model 𝑀0 generates diverse and semantically rich
text. As the autophagy process progresses, 𝑀𝑗 is repeatedly fine-tuned on its own outputs, and
over time, it begins to produce increasingly repetitive and formulaic sentences (e.g., frequently
repeating phrases like "The system is designed to... " or "This method allows for... "). This decline
in lexical diversity can be measured by a decrease in linguistic entropy 𝐻, leading to a growing
Δ𝑗 (𝐻), a clear signal of collapse along the linguistic entropy dimension.
In existing studies [35, 45], model collapse is typically diagnosed when the deviation increases
monotonically or persistently across iterations, revealing the cumulative degradation of the model’s
generative capacity.

4 Autophagy Simulation Framework
While the definitions of autophagy and model collapse apply to any foundational model, we focus on
Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., foundation models focused on understanding and generating
human language [34].
Our simulation framework, inspired by Shumailov et al. [39], begins with a pre-trained foundation
model 𝑀0 and a datasetD0 = {𝑑(real)
1 ,...,𝑑 (real)
𝑛 }of 𝑛human-authored text documents. The framework
(schematized in Algorithm 1) is an iterative process in which 𝑀0 generates continuations from
fixed prompts and fine-tunes itself on some combination of human-authored and AI-generated
documents. The generation and fine-tuning steps are repeated several times to mimic the autophagy
process.
During an initialization phase (lines 1-3 of Algorithm 1), we truncate each human-authored
document 𝑑(real)
𝑖 ∈D0 to 𝑘 tokens. This yields a set of 𝑛prompts 𝑃 = {𝑝1,...,𝑝 𝑛 }that remain fixed
throughout the entire simulation. Fixing the prompt set across iterations allows us to analyse model
collapse dynamics in a controlled setting.
During the simulation phase (lines 4-9 of Algorithm 1), at each simulation step𝑗(for 𝑗 = 1,...,𝑇 ),
we perform the following two operations in sequence:
(1) Generation. For each prompt𝑝𝑖 ∈𝑃, we use the model𝑀𝑗 −1 to generate a continuation𝑠(𝑗 −1)
𝑖
such that the total length of the combined text does not exceed 𝐿= 128 tokens (i.e., |𝑝𝑖 |= 𝑘,
and |𝑠(𝑗 −1)
𝑖 |≤ 128 −𝑘). Here, 𝑠(𝑗 −1)
𝑖 denotes the continuation of prompt 𝑝𝑖 generated by
model 𝑀𝑗 −1. We then define the AI-generated document as the concatenation of the prompt
and the generated continuation: 𝑑
(gen)
𝑖 = 𝑝𝑖 ||𝑠𝑗 −1
𝑖 , where ||denotes sequence concatenation.
The set of all such AI-generated documents forms a new dataset at simulation step𝑗, denoted
as D𝑗 = {𝑑
(gen)
1 ,...,𝑑
(gen)
𝑛 }.
(2) Fine-tuning. The model𝑀𝑗 −1 is fine-tuned to obtain the updated model𝑀𝑗 , using a datasetT𝑗
selected for this purpose. In the most basic setup T𝑗 = D𝑗 , i.e., only the documents generated
by 𝑀𝑗 −1 are used for fine-tuning. However, our framework is flexible and general: T𝑗 may
include any combination of human-authored and AI-generated documents selected according
to a ranking function 𝜌 : D→ R, where Ddenotes the set of documents (human-authored
or AI-generated) available at simulation step 𝑗. The ranking function 𝜌 may reflect various
desirable properties, such as linguistic diversity or alignment with a target distribution. The
top-𝑧 ranked documents according to 𝜌 are then selected to form T𝑗 . This flexible design
allows for experimentation with different document selection strategies and their impact on
model collapse across simulation steps.
By running the simulation for 𝑇 steps – alternating between generating documents, fine-tuning
the model, and repeating the generation – we obtain a sequence of increasingly specialised models
𝑀1,𝑀2,...,𝑀 𝑇 and a correspondingly corpus of AI-generated datasets D1,D2,..., D𝑇 .
It is worth noting that our simulation framework, as well as those introduced by other studies
on model collapse [20, 35, 39, 45], may introduce some biases. By always conditioning on real data
(prompts), the model may over-rely on the human-authored context (the first 𝑘 tokens), potentially
masking issues that would arise in a fully synthetic generation loop. Furthermore, this setup may
underestimate exposure bias and model collapse effects that can occur when both inputs and
outputs are AI-generated.

5 Measuring model collapse: a standard measure, and two new ones
A key challenge in studying model collapse is how to measure it as autophagy progresses. In
this paper, we extend the set of measures used in prior work [35] by introducing new measures
that capture previously overlooked aspects of collapse. Specifically, we evaluate model collapse
using an existing measure (linguistic entropy), a new measure capturing the model’s commonsense
reasoning—commonsense inference accuracy, and two new metrics based on next-token probability
distribution: the Gini coefficient and the collapsed prediction indicator.
Linguistic entropy. We adopt linguistic entropy as our primary metric to quantify model
collapse because it offers a simple yet informative measure of the diversity in the model’s output
distribution. A decline in linguistic entropy over simulation steps indicates that the model is
producing increasingly repetitive or predictable text, which is an essential symptom of model
collapse. While other metrics such as self-BLEU [2], distinct-n [27], or perplexity [46] could also
be used, entropy captures the underlying theoretical measure of information content, making it
a suitable and parsimonious choice for our analysis. Formally, given a text document𝑑, let 𝑊(𝑑)
denote the set of unique tokens in 𝑑. We define the normalised linguistic entropy of𝑑 as:
𝐻(𝑑)= −
Í
𝑤∈𝑊 (𝑑)𝑞𝑤 log(𝑞𝑤)
log |𝑊(𝑑)| (1)
where 𝑞𝑤 is the empirical probability of token 𝑤 in 𝑑, computed as the frequency of 𝑤 divided by
the total number of terms in 𝑑. The normalisation factor log |𝑊(𝑑)|ensures that entropy values
are comparable across documents with different vocabulary sizes.
For each model 𝑀𝑗 , and for each prompt, we measure linguistic entropy and then report the
mean value across prompts.
Next-token probability. To gain further insight into the lack of diversity, we analyse the
model’s next-token probability distribution, which reflects the model’s confidence when predicting
J. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.
111:8 Gambetta et al.
the next token in a sequence. High concentration of probability mass on a few tokens indicates
lower diversity and potential model collapse.
Given a model 𝑀𝑗 , we randomly sample 1,000 human-authored documents for each dataset from
those never used during fine-tuning. Each document is truncated to its first 32 tokens to create
a prompt. We then query 𝑀𝑗 to predict the next token given each prompt and extract the full
probability distribution over the top 100 most likely tokens, obtaining one distribution for each
prompt. From these distributions, we compute two complementary metrics:
(1) Gini coefficient. This measures the inequality of the next-token probability distribution. A
high Gini coefficient indicates that the model assigns most of the probability mass to a small
number of tokens, suggesting reduced diversity. Given a probability vector𝑞= (𝑞1,𝑞2,...,𝑞 𝑛),
the Gini coefficient is defined as:
𝐺(𝑞)=
Í𝑛
𝑖=1
Í𝑛
𝑗=1 |𝑞𝑖 −𝑞𝑗 |
2𝑛Í𝑛
𝑖=1 𝑞𝑖
,
where 𝑛 is the number of candidate tokens (here, 𝑛 = 100). The Gini coefficient ranges
between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates perfect equality (all tokens are equally probable), while
higher values indicate increasing concentration of probabilities on fewer tokens.
(2) Collapsed predictions. This measure captures extreme overconfidence and deterministic
behaviour in next-token prediction. Given a probability vector 𝑞 = (𝑞1,...,𝑞 𝑛), we say a
prediction is collapsed if there is probability that exceeds the threshold 𝜏 = 0.99. Thus, we
define the collapse indicator 𝐶(𝑞)as 1 if the prediction is collapsed:
𝐶(𝑞)=
(
1 if ∃𝑘 : 𝑞𝑘 > 𝜏,
0 otherwise.
For each model 𝑀𝑗 , and for each prompt, we compute the Gini coefficient and the collapsed-
prediction indicator. We then report the mean Gini across prompts and the percentage of prompts
flagged as collapsed (i.e., the average of the indicator times 100). These two measures together
offer a fine-grained view of how unequal the next-token probability distribution becomes over
simulation steps or, put differently, how predictable the AI-generated text is.
Commonsensical Inference Accuracy. A crucial question is whether collapse also compro-
mises the model’s ability to generate meaningful sentences. To explore this, we use the commonsense
natural language inference task, which tests whether a model can plausibly complete a given sen-
tence. We adopt the HellaSwag dataset [47], which contains 70,000 sentence prompts, each paired
with four candidate endings (¯𝑎,𝑎1,𝑎2,𝑎3). Of these, only one is a coherent and commonsensical
continuation ¯𝑎; the other three are intentionally implausible.
We compute the conditional probability of each candidate continuation given a prompt. The
model selects the option with the highest probability as its predicted continuation. For each
prompt 𝑝 ∈{𝑝1,...,𝑝 𝑁 }, let ˆ𝑎denote the model’s selected answer and ¯𝑎the ground-truth (correct)
continuation. We define a binary scoring function 𝐼(𝑝)as follows:
𝐼(𝑝)=
(
1 if ˆ𝑎= ¯𝑎
0 otherwise.
The overall accuracy, which we call Commonsense Inference Accuracy (𝐴CI), is then computed
as the proportion of prompts for which the model selects the correct continuation:

This measure provides a high-level view of the model’s capacity to make plausible and contextually
appropriate decisions, beyond mere stylistic diversity.
6 Initial experiments with model collapse – and a new observation
We first provide settings for our experiments in Section 6.1. In Section 6.2, we replicate existing
collapse findings, with the traditional measure of linguistic entropy. In Section 6.3, we present some
results using our new measures, which lead to a new observation.
6.1 Experimental settings
The experimental settings used in our study are summarized in Table 2. Unless otherwise specified,
we set the prompt length to 𝑘 = 64 tokens and ask the model to generate an additional 64 tokens,
resulting in documents of length 𝐿 = 128, with an even 50% split between human-authored and
AI-generated tokens. To ensure statistical robustness, each configuration is run three times, and
we report the average and standard error of each metric across these runs. In Appendix A.1, we
compare varying the proportion of synthetic content by changing 𝑘 to 32 or 96 while keeping
𝐿= 128 fixed, then using truncated documents 64 tokens for next token probability and in the end
comparing mitigation results for different models.
Foundation Models. We conduct our experiments using three open-weight foundation models:
Llama2-7B (referred to as Llama2), Llama3-8B (Llama3), and Mistral-7B (Mistral). We select Llama2
for its public availability, strong performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, and favorable trade-off
between model quality and computational efficiency. Its moderate size (seven billion parameters)
allows for fast fine-tuning while maintaining robust language generation capabilities. To validate
the robustness of our findings, we replicate our experiments with the more recent Llama3 model as
well as the competitive Mistral. All models are fine-tuned using the Unsloth library with default
hyperparameters.1 Experiments are run on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPU.
Datasets. We adopt the text datasets used in the seminal study by Guo et al. [ 20], ensuring
consistency with prior work. These datasets span different domains and linguistic styles, offering a
robust testbed for evaluating model collapse:
•Wikitext (wiki) is a large-scale corpus comprising over 100 million tokens extracted from
verified English Wikipedia articles [ 32]. Following Guo et al. [ 20], we use the main body

Fine-tuning scenarios. We consider three main scenarios for fine-tuning the model 𝑀𝑗 −1,
based on the composition of the training set T𝑗 :
•AI: T𝑗 = D𝑗 , i.e., it contains only AI-generated documents produced by 𝑀𝑗 −1;
•human: T𝑗 contains only human-authored documents;
•mixed: T𝑗 contains a mixture of human-authored and AI-generated documents.
For all models, datasets, and fine-tuning scenarios, we simulate the autophagy process over
𝑇 = 10 steps, following standard practice in the literature [39].

6.2 Model collapse results using linguistic entropy
Our simulations with Llama2 under the AI fine-tuning scenario confirm the findings of prior
work [20, 35, 39]: the average linguistic entropy consistently declines across simulation steps,
signaling progressive model collapse. This decline is evident both when the model is fine-tuned
on the combined dataset – wiki, xls, and sci – with a relative decrease of approximately 7.5%
at simulation step 10 compared to step 0, and when fine-tuned on individual datasets, where the
relative decrease ranges from 4.7% on sci to 8.7% on wiki (see Figure 1). The collapse in linguistic
diversity clearly results from fine-tuning on the AI-generated documents, as no such decline is
observed when the model is fine-tuned on human-authored documents (see empty green dots in
Figure 1). We find similar results for Llama3 and Mistral (see Figure 12 in Appendix A.4).
6.3 Collapse results using our new measures
Model collapse is also evident when analyzing the evolution of next-token probability distributions.
Figure 2a-c illustrates an example with the top-five predicted tokens and their associated probabili-
ties at simulation steps 0, 5, and 10, using Llama2. The example refers to text generated in response
to the following prompt extracted from the sci dataset:

data and health information. It plays a vital role in improving the quality of the

Fig. 1. Effect of the autophagy process on linguistic entropy. Normalized linguistic entropy 𝐻(𝑑)of
documents generated by Llama2 (𝑘 = 64) over 10 simulation steps. Each curve represents a different fine-
tuning scenario: on human-authored documents (human, green open circles), on AI-generated documents from
individual datasets – AI: wiki (squares), AI: xls (diamons), and AI: sci (triangles) – and on a combination
of all three (AI: combined, red filled circles). The results confirm prior findings: linguistic entropy steadily
declines as the autophagy process progresses.
In Figure 2a-c, we observe that the distribution becomes increasingly skewed in simulation steps
5 and 10. In step 0, the token “paper” has the highest probability, but is still closely followed by other
plausible completions. By step 10, “paper” overwhelmingly dominates the distribution, highlighting
a marked loss in linguistic entropy and growing overconfidence in a single prediction.
To move beyond a single example, we extend this analysis to a broader set of 1,000 prompts
sampled from each dataset. Figure 2d–f illustrates how Llama2 assigns probabilities to the highest-
probability token for 1,000 prompts drawn from dataset sci. As simulation progresses, we observe
a clear shift toward higher probability values, reflecting increased next-token predictability and
a corresponding decline in linguistic diversity. Figure 10 in Appendix A.2 shows that the same
pattern also applies to datasets wiki and xls.
This trend is further supported by the evolution of the average Gini coefficient of the next-token
probability distributions, 𝐺(𝑞), and the percentage of collapse predictions, 𝐶(𝑞), over simulation
steps. As Figure 3a shows for Llama2, as the simulation goes by,𝐺(𝑞)increases. This indicates a
growing imbalance in the distribution of next-token probabilities, i.e., an increasing concentration
of the probability mass on a small subset of tokens. A similar pattern is observed for 𝐶(𝑞)(see
Figure 3b): as the simulation progresses, the percentage of collapsed predictions increases in all
fine-tuning scenarios analyzed. Figure 12 in Appendix A.4 shows that similar results hold for
Llama3 and Mistral.
Model collapse also degrades the model’s capacity to generate meaningful sentences. We find
that the Llama2’s commonsensical inference accuracy, 𝐴CI, deteriorates over simulation steps: its
ability to generate commonsensical answers declines consistently (see Figure 4). This degradation
is evident especially when the model is trained on the combined dataset – with a relative decrease

of approximately 23% – but also when trained on each dataset individually, with decreases ranging
from 1.7% on sci to 16.3% on xls (see Figure 4). In other words, as the autophagy process unfolds,
the model’s predictions increasingly diverge from common sense. This unprecedented finding
shows that autophagy not only diminishes linguistic entropy, but also degrades commonsensical
inference capabilities. The observed collapse can be attributed to the use of AI-generated documents
for fine-tuning, as the decline is markedly less pronounced when the model is trained on human-
authored documents (see Figure 4). Figure 12 in Appendix A.4 shows that similar results hold for
Llama3 and Mistral.
Table 3 illustrates an example of how the model’s outputs evolve across iterations of the autophagy
process. At simulation step 0, the generated continuations are fluent and meaningful, closely aligned
with the prompt. By step 5, signs of collapse appear, with increasing redundancy, loss of specificity,
and mild incoherence, especially in the xls and sci datasets. By step 10, collapse becomes evident:
the model tends to repeat phrases and produce templated or meaningless sequences.
The results reported so far correspond to the case𝑘 = 64, where each prompt contains 64 human-
authored tokens and the model generates up to 64 additional tokens to complete the document.

tokens.
We now vary 𝑘 = 32,64,96, which correspond to 75%, 50% and 25% of the AI-generated tokens
out of a total of 128, using Llama2 and the combined dataset to generate prompts. Figure 9 in
Appendix A.1 shows the average linguistic entropy, commonsensical inference accuracy, the average
Gini coefficient and the percentage of collapsed predictions changing along simulation steps for
different percentages of AI-generated tokens in generated documents. We find that as 𝑘 decreases,
model collapse becomes more pronounced across all the measures. In other words, increasing the
fraction of AI-generated tokens accelerates model collapse, intensifying the loss of diversity and
the overestimation of high-probable tokens.
7 Learning by surprise: a new method for mitigating model collapse
An open question is how to mitigate model collapse during the autophagy process [45]. A common
strategy is to incorporate human-authored documents into fine-tuning, rather than relying solely
on AI-generated documents – an approach shown to reduce the severity of model collapse [45].
However, the literature does not provide specific criteria for selecting which documents are most
suitable, treating all human-authored texts as equally effective.
Based on the findings of Section 6.3, here we propose a strategy for selecting the most effective
documents (whether human-authored or AI-generated) to mitigate model collapse. Our approach
is motivated by the observation that model collapse is marked by an increasing inequality in
next-token probabilities (as shown in Section 6.3), where the model becomes increasingly confident
in a small set of high-probability tokens. This growing imbalance can be interpreted as a loss of
surprise: the model increasingly generates texts that align too closely with its own expectations,
producing predictable sequences with little novelty. This phenomenon echoes Friston’s free energy
principle [16], which posits that human agents minimise surprise to maintain internal coherence. In
autophagy, however, excessive surprise minimisation becomes maladaptive: the model reinforces its

priors and loses expressive capacity. We argue, therefore, that model collapse can be counteracted
by intentionally reintroducing surprise into the learning process.
To this end, we introduce thesurplexity measure, which quantifies a model’s surprise in response
to a given document. Intuitively, surplexity is defined as the perplexity of the model when processing
the document: higher values indicate that the content is less expected by the model, and therefore
more surprising [33]. Mathematically, given a model 𝑀𝑗 and a document 𝑑 = (𝑤1,𝑤2,...,𝑤 𝑚)of 𝑚
tokens, we define surplexity of𝑑given 𝑀𝑗 as the exponential of the average negative log-likelihood
of each token given its context:

= exp(E[−log𝑞𝑖 ])=

where 𝑞𝑖 = 𝑃(𝑤𝑖 |𝑤0,...,𝑤 𝑖−1). It is important to distinguish between surplexity and linguistic
entropy: while both capture aspects of diversity, linguistic entropy is a property of the document
alone, whereas surplexity depends on both the document and the model, reflecting how surprising
the document is from the model’s perspective.
To clarify the concept of surplexity, let us consider the two example documents from thewiki
and sci datasets in Figure 5. Each token is shown as a box, with its background color representing
the probability assigned by the original pre-trained Llama2. We observe that the wiki document
(on the left) contains consistently higher-probability tokens than the sci document (on the right),
reflecting a closer alignment with the model’s expectations. Accordingly, the surplexity score of
the wiki document given Llama2 is much lower (𝑆Llama2 (𝑑)= 1.6) than the surplexity score of the
sci document (𝑆Llama2 (𝑑)= 44.5).

and the right from sci. Each token is displayed in a box, with background color indicating the probability

than the sci document, reflecting a lower level of model surprise (i.e., lower surplexity).
the figure also includes the surplexity distribution of AI-generated documents, which typically
consists of high-probability tokens and thus lower surplexity.
We observe that the wiki documents have the lowest average surplexity, closely aligning with
the surplexity scores of the AI-generated documents. In contrast, the xls and sci documents
exhibit significantly higher average surplexity values. This suggests that documents in wiki are
inherently less surprising to the model, i.e., they more closely reflect LLama2’s internal expectations,
compared to those in xls and sci, which contain content that is more novel or unexpected from
the model’s perspective. The wiki dataset’s low surplexity correlates with more severe collapse: as
the simulation progresses, models fine-tuned on wiki consistently degrade more than the other
datasets (see Figures 1 and 3).
We hypothesize that model collapse is driven by fine-tuning on documents that fail to surprise
the model, i.e., those with low surplexity relative to its expectations. To address this, we propose
a surplexity-based mitigation strategy : at each simulation step 𝑗, we select the 1,000 documents
– regardless of whether they are human-authored or AI-generated – with the highest surplexity
given model 𝑀𝑗 . This ensures that fine-tuning targets the most surprising content, independent of
document origin. This represents a clear advantage over existing approaches, as our method does
not rely on verifying whether a document is human-authored – a task that becomes increasingly
challenging as generative AI content proliferates online.
We compare our surplexity-based strategy against three baselines: (i) fine-tuning on a random
sample of 1,000 human-authored documents,(ii) a random sample of 1,000 AI-generated documents,
and (iii) the 1,000 documents with the highest linguistic entropy, whether human-authored or
AI-generated. The latter strategy is motivated by prior work, where a decline in linguistic entropy
is commonly used to characterise model collapse [39].
As Figure 7 shows, our mitigation strategy effectively prevents model collapse, achieving an
average linguistic entropy comparable to the approach that randomly samples human-authored
documents. As expected, the entropy-based strategy reaches the highest levels of linguistic entropy,

since it is explicitly optimized for that metric. A similar trend holds for commonsensical inference
accuracy: over simulation steps, the surplexity-based strategy achieves the highest accuracy, slightly
outperforming the human-text baseline.
However, the most striking benefits of the surplexity-based strategy emerge in terms of the
average Gini coefficient and the percentage of collapsed predictions. On both metrics, it consistently
yields the lowest values, indicating a more balanced next-token probability distribution and less
overconfident, repetitive generation. Similar results hold for Llama3 and Mistral (see Figure 12 in
the Appendix).
To understand which documents are selected by the surplexity-based strategy, we analyze the
top 1,000 documents chosen for fine-tuning at each simulation step 𝑗. These documents can be
either human-authored or AI-generated and are ranked by their surplexity given model𝑀𝑗 . Figure 8
shows the proportion of selected documents by source. Although nearly all selected documents are
human-authored, the share of AI-generated documents increases slightly toward later simulation
steps, suggesting that some may reach higher surplexity if the process continues. Among human-
authored sources, wiki contributes the fewest documents (fewer than 100 per step) because its
content is consistently less surprising to the model (as shown in Figure 6). While sci documents
are generally preferred, the number of selected documents from sci and xls alternates across
simulation steps in a complementary, oscillating pattern. When model 𝑀𝑗 is fine-tuned primarily
on xls, its surplexity on that dataset decreases in the next step, making xls documents less likely
to be selected again. This highlights that the property of causing model collapse is not an intrinsic
characteristic of a document, but rather depends on the relationship between the document and
the specific model.
8 Discussion and Future Works
In this paper, we addressed three key gaps in the understanding of model collapse: how to charac-
terize a collapsed model directly from its probability distributions; which properties of training
documents contribute to collapse; and how to mitigate collapse without relying on knowing whether
data is human-authored or AI-generated. Our contributions are built around the concept of surplex-
ity, a measure of model surprise, which we use both to detect collapse and to filter training data. We

show that this strategy is effective across models and datasets, offering a principled, model-centric
approach to understanding and mitigating collapse. A key advantage of this approach is that it
does not require verifying whether a document is human-authored.
Research on cognitive science shows that surprise drives learning: infants look longer at physi-
cally impossible or counterintuitive events, and those events subsequently enhance exploration and
learning [3, 28]. Infants also allocate attention by preferring stimuli that are neither too predictable
nor too random [25]. In humans more broadly, Bayesian surprise robustly attracts attention, offering
a formal link between surprise and belief updates [24], and Friston’s free-energy principle frames

for LLMs – surplexity – is an engineering analogue of these findings: by prioritizing high-surprise

documents, training targets inputs most likely to update the model’s beliefs, rather than reinforcing
already-expected outputs, echoing how infants learn most from the unexpected [40].
Our study has some limitations. To ensure computational efficiency and reduce confounding
factors, we fixed key fine-tuning parameters such as the number of training documents and the
learning rate. These choices are motivated by prior work that has already examined their impact
on model collapse [23, 41]. Our analysis is also limited to LLMs and does not extend to generative
models for images, audio, video, or multimodal content. While we believe the effectiveness of the
surplexity-based mitigation strategy may extend to these domains, further validation is needed.
Additionally, our simulation setup may introduce biases. Since we condition generation on prompts
extracted from human-authored text (following the approach of Shumailov et al. [39]), the model
may over-rely on this context, potentially masking effects that would arise in fully synthetic
generation loops. This could lead us to underestimate exposure bias and collapse in scenarios where
both inputs and outputs are AI-generated. Finally, as in the broader literature on AI autophagy
and model collapse [ 35, 36], our findings are based on simulations. Real-world systems are far
more complex, with many interacting factors influencing autophagy dynamics. As such, our results
should be seen as hypotheses to be tested through carefully controlled experiments on actual
generative AI platforms.
Our study opens several directions for future research. We conducted our experiments on
three textual domains: general articles (wiki), scientific abstracts (sci), and news articles (xls).
While these datasets are quite diverse, they are still about human language. It would be valuable to
investigate how model collapse unfolds in other contexts such as programming code or mathematical
writing, which present unique characteristics. Programming code, for example, has a smaller
vocabulary and follows standardized structures and conventions, which may naturally reduce
linguistic variety. A similar observation applies to mathematical language, where notation is often
fixed and formalization follows well-established norms. In such settings, autophagy might progress

even faster, as the baseline content is already low in surprise. This is consistent with our findings: in
our experiments, the dataset with the lowest surplexity (wiki) also exhibited faster model collapse.
However, low linguistic diversity in domains like programming or mathematics may not be harmful;
in fact, it could be beneficial, promoting more consistent formatting and structure. Exploring these
domain-specific dynamics could provide deeper insights into when collapse is detrimental versus
when it may help reinforce useful conventions. We believe this is a promising direction for future
work.
From a broader perspective, the concept of surplexity opens up intriguing questions about the
level of surprise in human-authored content. As our experiments show, different datasets elicit
different levels of surprise in LLMs, suggesting that some types of content are inherently more
predictable than others. This raises the possibility of characterizing entire content domains –
literary genres, musical lyrics, or scientific texts – based on how surprising they are to a model. In
other words, how surprising is a corpus of documents from the perspective of an LLM? This line
of inquiry could extend beyond text to other human-created media, such as visual art or music,
offering a model-based lens through which to explore and compare creative domains.
Our work offers an innovative contribution to the ongoing debate on autophagy and model
collapse, and more broadly to the study of human-AI coevolution [ 36]. Human-AI coevolution
focuses on understanding and modeling feedback loops between humans and AI systems, of which
AI autophagy is a prime example. Similar feedback dynamics have been observed in various human-
AI ecosystems, such as online retail and urban mapping, where recommender systems can lead to
a long-term loss of behavioral diversity among users [8, 9, 15, 26, 31, 35]. It would be valuable to
explore whether this loss of diversity, like model collapse in LGMs, can be formalised as a reduction
in surprise and whether the surplexity measure could be adapted to diagnose and mitigate such
effects in broader human-AI ecosystems.

A Appendix
A.1 Different percentage of synthetic tokens
In this section, we examine how model collapse varies with the share of AI-generated tokens. We fix
the total document length at 𝐿= 128 and vary the prompt length 𝑘 ∈{32,96}; these correspond to
25% and 75% prompt tokens (and thus 75% and 25% of AI-generated tokens), respectively. Figure 9
reports 𝐻(𝑑), 𝐴CI, 𝐺(𝑞), 𝐶(𝑞)across simulation steps for each 𝑘. Across all measures, collapse
becomes more pronounced as 𝑘 decreases, indicating consistent trends among the four measures.

A.2 Top-ranked next-token probabilities for all datasets
In the main manuscript, Figure 2 (d–f) reports the distribution of top-ranked next-token probabilities
using sci prompts; here we extend the analysis to other datasets. As shown in Figure 10, all datasets
exhibit a systematic shift toward higher top-token probabilities over simulation steps. Collapse is
strongest for wiki: by step 5, more than half of the top tokens exceed 0.9. By contrast, sci shows
the weakest collapse, with fewer than half surpassing 0.9 even at step 10.

(d-f) and sci (g-i) dataset, evaluated at steps 0, 5, and 10. A clear shift toward higher probability values is
observed as the autophagy process unfolds, with an higher collapse in the case of wiki.
A.3 Evaluation of Gini coefficient and collapsed predictions with prompts of 64 tokens
In Figure 7 of Section 6, we evaluated fine-tuning scenarios using next-token–based metrics with
prompts of 32 tokens. Here, we replicate the analysis with prompts of 64 tokens. The surplexity
scenario again shows the lowest degree of collapse across all metrics, thereby reinforcing its
effectiveness.
A.4 Mitigation of model collapse using different models
In the main section, all results are reported for Llama2. Here we extend the analysis to Llama3 and
Mistral, evaluating the same fine-tuning scenarios with our model-collapse metrics. The patterns
observed for Llama2 generalize: both additional models exhibit the same trends, confirming the
robustness of our findings.
