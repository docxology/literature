Abstract—This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory plan-
ning framework for UA Vs operating under adversarial jamming
conditions. Leveraging Bayesian Active Inference, the approach
combines expert-generated demonstrations with probabilistic
generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning,
low-level motion policies, and wireless signal feedback. During
deployment, the UA V performs online inference to anticipate
interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory accord-
ingly—without prior knowledge of jammer locations. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-
expert performance, significantly reducing communication inter-
ference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement
learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in
dynamic environments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UA Vs) play a crucial role in
military, public, and civilian applications due to their com-
pact size, flexible deployment capabilities, and outstanding
performance. These vehicles are utilized for various purposes,
including low-altitude surveillance, post-disaster rescue oper-
ations, logistics support, coverage missions, aerial data collec-
tors, and communication assistance [1]. However, UA Vs face
significant communication challenges that continue to restrict
their performance and broaden their scope of applications.
The broadcast nature of UA V communications, combined
with the dominance of line-of-sight (LoS) propagation in UA V-
ground channels, makes them more susceptible to jamming
attacks, which poses significant security challenges [2], [3].
Techniques such as UA V cooperative relay communication,
trajectory optimization, power control, and other resource
allocation strategies can effectively help resist jamming attacks
and enhance security performance [4]. Owing to the UA V’s
controllable trajectory, combating jammers in the spatial do-
main by maneuvering away from the jamming areas is an
attractive option [5]. Leveraging UA V’s flexibility and freedom
of movement to design anti-jamming flight paths is a powerful
strategy for safeguarding legitimate communications in UA V-
enabled systems [6].
By leveraging flexible mobility, anti-jamming trajectories
were developed in [6]–[9] to protect legitimate transmissions
in UA V-enabled systems from interference caused by jammers.
However, these studies relied on conventional trajectory opti-
mization methods that depend on complete prior knowledge
of system parameters. Such methods often suffer from slow
convergence, making them impractical for intelligent and
autonomous UA Vs operating in real-time within dynamic envi-
ronments. In contrast, AI-based anti-jamming trajectory design
using reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more efficient and
adaptable solution, as demonstrated in [10]–[12]. Although
RL methods can quickly generate planning solutions once the
network is trained, the training process itself demands a sub-
stantial number of samples and multiple training epochs, which
require significant time investments. Additionally, many RL
methods struggle to adapt to new situations, often necessitating
extensive retraining [13]. This challenge can hinder real-time
prediction and decision-making. Excitingly, active inference
emerges as a strong alternative, providing a comprehensive
framework for understanding how living organisms interact
with their environments [14]. It emphasizes modeling per-
ception, learning, and decision-making to maximize Bayesian
model evidence or minimize free energy.
This work presents an innovative scheme for designing UA V
anti-jamming trajectories based on Bayesian active inference,
addressing the limitations of existing reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. Specifically, we utilize an expert optimizer dur-
ing training to generate several training examples, which help
us develop an efficient UA V trajectory for specific missions,
both in the presence and absence of jamming. We construct
a world model that encodes the expert’s adopted strategy for
tackling these training examples and how the expert interacted
with the environment to avoid jamming. During testing, the
UA V employs autonomous decision-making, enabling it to
select an appropriate plan for the current mission, adapt to new
situations not encountered during training, and effectively nav-
igate critical challenges such as jamming. A key contribution
of our work is the use of an optimizer to derive demonstration
results from which we learn the world model. This approach
minimizes unnecessary exploration and enhances efficiency,
thus leveraging the model’s contextual capabilities.
II. SYSTEMMODEL ANDPROBLEMFORMULATION
We consider a UA V-enabled communication system con-
sisting of a single UA Vu, a control base station (CBS)b, a
set of ground regionsN={1,2, . . . , N}that the UA V must
visit, and a set of ground-based jammersJ={1,2, . . . , J}.
The UA V flies at a fixed altitudeHwithin a square area of
side lengthD, where the target regions are randomly located.

Communication with the CBS takes place in discrete time slots
t= 1,2, . . . , T, and may be disrupted by the jammers.
The wireless channel between the CBS and the UA V is
modeled as a ground-to-air link comprising line-of-sight (LoS)
and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components, while small-scale
fading is neglected due to its relatively minor influence. The
channel path loss is given by:
P L(b, u) =

(xb −x u)2 + (yb −y u)2 +z 2u is the 3D
distance between the CBS and the UA V , andαis the path-loss
exponent.

with typical urban parametersΦ = 150andΨ = 15.
Jammers are randomly located on the ground and interfere
with the UA V’s reception when it enters their effective range.
The received jamming power from jammerjis given by:
Ij =p j|dju|−α,(3)
wherep j is the jammer’s transmit power, andd ju =p
(xj −x u)2 + (yj −y u)2 +z 2u is the distance between jam-
merjand the UA V .

Γu = pb(PLoSβLoS +P NLoSβNLoS)|dbu|−α
P

wherep b is the CBS transmit power andσ 2 is the noise power.
The UA V’s mission is modeled as a traveling salesman
problem (TSP) where it must visit all target regions while
minimizing both the total travel distance and exposure to
jamming. The 3D distance between any two regionsnand

In the above formulation,α nm ∈ {0,1}is a binary decision
variable indicating whether the UA V travels directly from

region is visited exactly once and that the UA V returns to the
starting location, forming a complete tour.
The variableβ j(t)indicates whether the UA V is within the

βj(t) =

Constraint (5c) enforces the binary nature ofβ j(t). Con-
straint (5d) guarantees communication reliability by requiring
the SINR to remain above a predefined thresholdΓ min at all
times. The objective function balances the trade-off between
minimizing travel distance and reducing communication inter-
ference, weighted by coefficientsλ 1 andλ 2.

jamming threats. The method comprises three key stages,
combining offline learning from expert demonstrations with
online probabilistic inference (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).
Expert Demonstration Generation:First, reference tra-
jectories are computed by solving the optimization problem
in (5) under both normal and jammed conditions. These
demonstrations encode near-optimal behaviors for different
interference scenarios and provide the data needed to learn
robust decision-making patterns.
Hierarchical World Model Construction:Using the
demonstrations, the UA V builds a generative world model
that reflects how its actions lead to changes in position and
signal quality. The model includes: (i) a high-level policy
mapping symbolic action sequences over regions; (ii) a low-
level planner encoding executable paths via motion primitives;
and (iii) an outcome model predicting sensory consequences
like SINR changes. This structured model enables the UA V to
simulate and evaluate candidate trajectories before execution.
Online Inference and Trajectory Adaptation:During
operation, the UA V performs active inference over the learned
model. By minimizing expected free energy, it selects high-
level plans that balance goal achievement and uncertainty
reduction. At the motion level, a Kalman filter–based attractor
generates smooth trajectories that follow symbolic guidance
while responding to noise. Signal observations update the
UA V’s beliefs in real time, allowing it to detect interference
and adapt its path dynamically.
Overall, this three-stage architecture equips the UA V with
the ability to reason over actions and sensory outcomes,
resulting in adaptive, communication-aware navigation even
in adversarial environments.
A. Expert Demonstration Generation
The wireless environment is modeled as a graphG n =
(Vn,En), where each vertexv m ∈ Vn represents a ground re-
gion at positionp vm = [xvm, yvm], and each edge(n, m)∈ En
denotes a viable transition with associated cost:
cnm =
(
dnm,ifH 0
dnm + PT
t=1
PJ
j=1 Ij,ifH 1
(7)
Here,H 0 andH 1 correspond to nominal and adversarial (jam-
ming) conditions, respectively. For each of theKmissions, an
expert planner (e.g., 2-OPT) generates optimal solutions under
both hypotheses, resulting in datasetsD 0 ={G (0)
k }K
k=1 and
D1 ={G (1)
k }K
k=1. Each expert demonstration is expressed as
a tupleL (h)
k = (L(h,high)
k , L(h,low)
k )forh∈ {0,1}, where the
high-level component encodes the region visitation sequence,
and the low-level component describes the corresponding
motion trajectory. UnderH 1, the region sequence is preserved,
but the trajectory deviates to circumvent jamming zones.
Dictionary 1captures high-level symbolic structure from
the demonstrations inL 0 ={L (0)
k }K
k=1. Each region is treated
as a letterl n, and transitions are defined as directed edges
e(ln, lm), forming generalized letters ˜ln = [ln, e(ln, lm)]. The
mission is encoded as a wordw k ={ ˜li}n
i=1. This structure
forms a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) that
models high-level navigation patterns under nominal condi-
tions.
Dictionary 2represents low-level motion strategies derived

learning of modular low-level controllers that adapt to varying
interference conditions.
Dictionary 3encodes signal perception during low-level
motion. At each step, the UA V records the Signal-to-
Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), which is discretized
using an unsupervised clustering algorithm (e.g., Growing
Neural Gas) into signal lettersγ i = [Γi, ˙Γi], whereΓ i is the
SINR value and ˙Γi is its temporal derivative. These letters
are organized into two sets:Υ 0 ={γ i | H0}for normal
conditions andΥ 1 ={γ i | H1}for jamming scenarios.
This representation links control actions to communication
outcomes, enriching the behavioral model with environment-
aware signal feedback.
Together, the three dictionaries define a structured repre-
sentation of expert behavior at multiple levels of abstraction.
Dictionary 1models symbolic region sequences and their
transitions;Dictionary 2captures low-level motion control un-
der both nominal and adversarial conditions; andDictionary
3characterizes the sensory consequences of actions through
discretized signal observations. This multi-level decomposition
enables separate learning of high-level planning and low-
level control, while grounding both in realistic signal feedback
experienced by the UA V .
B. Hierarchical World Model Construction
To model expert demonstrations in a structured and prob-
abilistic way, we adopt a hierarchical framework based on
Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GDBNs), as shown
in Fig. 3, integrating symbolic planning, motion control, and
signal feedback. The model comprises three levels:
Dictionary 1encodes symbolic mission plans as region
visitation sequences. Each plan is represented as a word
wk ={ ˜li}n
i=1, where ˜li = [li, e(li, li+1)]includes the current
region and the transition to the next. The total cost of the
mission is:
zk =
nX
i=1
c(li, li+1)(9)
The GDBN includes four layers: the symbolic planw t, transi-
tion ˜lt, expected costc t, and cumulative costz t. This supports
efficient selection of high-level plans with minimal expected
cost.
Dictionary 2captures low-level motion policies as velocity
wordsw v
k ={l v
i }n′
i=1, withl v
i = [v i
x, vi
y, vi
z]. These encode
either straight or evasive trajectories depending on the presence
of jammers. Words are grouped into tokensT j defined by
jammer characteristics(r j, pj):
Tj ={w v
k |jammer typej}(10)
A latent variablej i selects the active token:
Ti =
(
Tj,ifj i =j
T0,otherwise (11)
A sampled word generates velocity commands, and UA V
motion is modeled as:
˙xt =−K v( ˙xt −l v
t ) +ϵ t, ϵ t ∼ N(0,Σ)(12)
In discrete time, this becomes:
xt+1 =x t +u t +ϵ t, u t =αl v
t ∆t, α= Kv
1 +K v
(13)
whereu t withα∈(0,1)modulating the strength of attraction,
andϵ t captures stochastic variability. This formulation treats
symbolic velocities as attractors, enabling robust trajectory
execution without predefined waypoints.
Dictionary 3models signal feedback by clustering SINR
observations into symbolic signal lettersγ t = [Γt, ˙Γt], repre-
senting SINR and its temporal change. Letters are categorized
as nominal or jammed, based on the jammer indicatorJ t ∈
{0,1}. The GDBN linksJ t toγ t, a latent SINR statex t, and
the observed signalz t. This allows the UA V to interpret noisy
measurements and adapt behavior based on communication
quality.
Together, the three dictionaries form a hierarchical model
that unifies symbolic planning, low-level control, and percep-
tion. This structure supports adaptive, interpretable, and robust
UA V decision-making under both nominal and adversarial
conditions.
C. Bayesian Active Inference for Online Trajectory Adaptation
a) Online High-Level Planning:During deployment, the
UA V must plan symbolic routes over dynamic environments
by visiting mission-critical regions. This high-level task is
modeled using the GDBN structure from Dictionary 1, which
encodes expert demonstrations as symbolic region-visitation
sequences.
Let the current mission be defined by an unordered set of
target regions:
wtesting
t ={l 1, l2, . . . , ln}
where eachl i denotes a region. This set may evolve as targets
appear or vanish. The UA V aims to infer a plausible ordered
sequenceˆwthat meets the mission goal while aligning with
prior expert knowledge.
To achieve this, the UA V evaluates a candidate setW t =
{ˆw1, . . . ,ˆwK}, consisting of feasible permutations ofw t,
constrained by structural priors (e.g., preserved subsequences).
Each candidateˆw k is treated as a hypothesis and passed
through the generative model to predict the expected latent
transition and cumulative cost distributions:
π(˜lt) =P( ˜lt|˜lt−1,ˆwk), π(c t) =P(c t|ct−1, ˜lt)·π( ˜lt).(14)
Each hypothesis is then compared to a trusted reference
planπ(c ref)from Dictionary 1. This comparison uses KL
divergence to compute an abnormality score:
A( ˆwk) =D KL (π(ct)∥λ(c t)),(15)
whereλ(c t) =P(z t|ct)is the diagnostic distribution induced
by observations. A higherA( ˆwk)implies a greater deviation
from expert behavior, indicating greater epistemic uncertainty.
Following the Active Inference principle, the UA V selects
the candidate that minimizes this abnormality:
ˆw∗ = arg min
ˆwk∈Wt
A( ˆwk).(16)
This ensures that the chosen plan is both contextually
grounded and statistically aligned with successful prior knowl-
edge, enabling robust symbolic planning under uncertainty.
b) Online Low-Level Planning and Signal-Driven Jam-
ming Response:Onceˆw∗ is selected, the UA V enters the low-
level planning phase. For each segment between consecutive
regions, e.g., froml ∗
1 tol ∗
2, a velocity wordw v
m from Dictio-
nary 2 is chosen, composed of letters{l v
i }encoding discrete
velocity vectors.
The UA V incorporates these targets within a Kalman filter,
using eachl v
i as an attractor in the discrete-time dynamics of
Eq. (13), which supports smooth and uncertainty-aware motion
execution.
Simultaneously, the UA V predicts expected SINR valuesˆγt
via Dictionary 3. At each time step, the observed signalz t is
compared with the prediction using:
Asig
t =D KL (π(ˆγt)∥λ(ˆγt)).(17)
Large values ofA sig
t suggest potential jamming. The UA V then
initiates inference over a set of candidate jammer particles
{θj}, each representing a hypothetical jammer locationq j =
[xj, yj]and radiusr j.
For eachθ j, a simulated SINR trajectoryˆγ (j)
t is generated,
and its cumulative abnormality is evaluated:
Ajam(θj) =
X
t
DKL

π(ˆγ(j)
t )∥λ(ˆγt)

.(18)
The most likely jammer is inferred as:
θ∗ = arg min
θj
Ajam(θj).(19)
The corresponding motion tokenT θ∗ from Dictionary 2
is selected, containing trajectories optimized for the inferred
jammer configuration. The UA V then chooses the trajectory
with the lowest expected signal abnormality:
w∗
anti = arg min
wvm∈Tθ∗
X
t
Asig
t (wv
m).(20)
This allows the UA V to escape jamming regions
while preserving communication reliability. The entire pro-
cess—combining hierarchical planning, probabilistic signal
reasoning, and real-time inference—enables intelligent adap-
tation to unforeseen wireless threats during mission execution.
IV. RESULTS ANDDISCUSSION
This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the
proposed hierarchical planning framework based on Bayesian
Active Inference. The objective is to assess its ability to
generate efficient and robust UA V trajectories in environments
with and without communication interference.
A. System Setup
The UA V operates in a1000×1000 m 2 2D environment
populated with randomly placed mission-critical nodes that
mimic real-world targets such as inspection points or commu-
nication hotspots. The UA V maintains a fixed altitude of200 m
and travels at constant speed, with its trajectory discretized at
1 mintervals to ensure precise control.
To model interference, jammers are randomly positioned
across the environment. Each emits within a50 mradius and
includes up to30 mof positional jitter to simulate deployment
uncertainty. The number and placement of jammers vary
across runs.
Communication occurs over a continuous downlink from
a control base station transmitting at1 W(30 dBm). The
wireless channel incorporates probabilistic path loss with LOS
probability0.9and NLOS probability0.1, path loss exponent
η= 2, and interceptsβ LOS = 1 dBandβ NLOS = 20 dB.
The UA V continuously estimates SINR, which informs both
its high-level planning and low-level control decisions.
Two datasets are used for training:Dataset 1includes
trajectories under nominal conditions, andDataset 2includes
examples with jammers. Expert-generated demonstrations are
used to construct the three-level dictionary model described
earlier, enabling the UA V to learn both symbolic planning
strategies and motion-level policies under different commu-
nication conditions.
B. Online Trajectory Adaptation
Fig. 4 illustrates an example of the UA V performing real-
time trajectory adaptation. In Fig. 4-(a), the UA V is tasked with
visiting a set of blue-marked target regions, unaware of the true
locations of red ‘X’-marked jammers. As the UA V moves, it
continuously updates its belief about the environment based
on observed SINR.
Figs. 4-(b) through (e) show how particles are used to
infer likely jammer positions. Green crosses indicate particle
hypotheses consistent with observed signal degradation, while
the red-bordered circle marks the most likely jammer location
inferred at that step. The UA V uses this information to select
anti-jamming motion policies from Dictionary 2 and re-plan
its path accordingly.
In Fig. 4-(f), the offline expert trajectory is shown for com-
parison. Despite not knowing the true jammer positions, the

unseen adversarial configurations.
C. Performance Evaluation
Fig. 5 compares the performance of our method to an
expert optimizer and a Q-learning baseline. In Fig. 5-(a), we
observe that the expert maintains near-zero interference thanks
to full knowledge of jammer positions. Q-learning performs
poorly as the number of targets increases, reflecting its reactive
nature and lack of environmental modeling. In contrast, our
framework maintains low interference levels by anticipating
jamming zones through probabilistic inference.
Fig. 5-(b) shows that the expert achieves the shortest com-
pletion times, but Bayesian Active Inference remains close.
While Q-learning becomes inefficient as complexity increases,
our method scales better by leveraging high-level symbolic
planning and low-level adaptation.
Fig. 6 evaluates the impact of increasing jammer den-
sity. As shown in (a), interference grows significantly for
Q-learning, which lacks adaptability. Our method maintains
lower interference even in dense environments due to online
inference. Fig. 6-(b) shows that mission duration increases

struggles to complete tasks under severe interference. These
results confirm the robustness and scalability of the proposed
approach.
Finally, Fig. 7 reports jammer localization accuracy. In
Fig. 7-(a), estimated locations (blue squares) are close to true
jammer positions (red circles). Fig. 7-(b) shows the RMSE
across varying jammer counts, with errors remaining below
20 min all cases. This confirms that the framework not
only plans effectively but also maintains accurate situational
awareness in uncertain environments.
Overall, these results highlight the strengths of Bayesian
Active Inference: principled integration of planning and per-
ception, online adaptation, and robust generalization under
communication threats—all while requiring only limited prior
knowledge of environmental dynamics.
V. CONCLUSION
We introduced a Bayesian Active Inference framework for
resilient UA V trajectory planning in the presence of jamming
threats. By incorporating expert knowledge into a structured
generative model, the UA V is able to reason over symbolic
mission objectives and adapt low-level motion based on real-
time signal observations. The method exhibits strong perfor-
mance across varying mission scales and jammer densities,
achieving low interference, accurate jammer localization, and
efficient path planning. These results underscore the potential
of hierarchical probabilistic inference for secure and adaptive
UA V operations in contested wireless environments. In future
work, we aim to extend the framework to additional wireless
channel models to further evaluate its robustness.
