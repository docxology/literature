Cognitive and motor compliance in intentional human-robot interaction
Hendry F. Chame† and Jun Tani†
Abstract—Embodiment and subjective experience in human-
robot interaction are important aspects to consider when
studying both natural cognition and adaptive robotics to hu-
man environments. Although several researches have focused
on nonverbal communication and collaboration, the study of
autonomous physical interaction has obtained less attention.
From the perspective of neurorobotics, we investigate the
relation between intentionality, motor compliance, cognitive
compliance, and behavior emergence. We propose a variational
model inspired by the principles of predictive coding and active
inference to study intentionality and cognitive compliance, and
an intermittent control concept for motor deliberation and
compliance based on torque feed-back. Our experiments with
the humanoid Torobo portrait interesting perspectives for the
bio-inspired study of developmental and social processes.
I. INTRODUCTION
Our society is probably changing into a world populated
by natural and artiﬁcial beings, where we will coexist with
robots at home and the oﬃce. However, at present, there is
still an important gap to be overcome, in particular, when
we pause to contemplate the amazing complexity of natural
behavior. This sort of sophistication is related to important
properties, among which are autonomy and intentionality.
When studying motor interaction between a human and
a robot, some works have focused on goal-directed collab-
oration (e.g. mediated by physical objects [1], and behavior
improvement [2]), leaving aside the social dimension of the
interaction with the robot partner. With some exceptions,
direct contact in autonomous behavior has been avoided
[3]. Moreover, in social robotics, the non-verbal aspects of
interaction have been studied from diverse modalities (e.g.
facial expressions [4] and touch [5]), though motor clues in
direct contact have attracted less attention.
In psychology, physical interaction is considered an in-
tuitive means of communication during human early life,
which underlies the acquisition and development of social
and cognitive skills [6]. Hence, it is paramount for human
development, and it is relevant for studying learning from
the perspective of developmental robotics [7].
Intentional motor interaction is certainly a broad phe-
nomenon that ought to be delimited. Thus, by taking inspi-
ration on neuroscience research, we hold the assumption that
intentionality involves an optimization process in hierarchical
representation structures, in which a top-down information
ﬂow characterizes the agency of purposeful actions in a given
context, whereas a bottom-up information ﬂow accounts for
theirconsequences.Weinvestigatethiswithintheperspective

of Friston’sfree energy principle theory [8], according to
which the brain attempts to resolve conﬂicts possibly appear-
ing between the top-down information ﬂow, developed by a
generative model, and the bottom-up sensory ﬂow, through
minimizing free energy as a statistical quantity.
Our research is interested in the study of harmonious
(or coherent) and disharmonious (or incoherent) interaction
between the human and the robot. Thus, an important
distinction is established between physical (or motor) and
cognitive (or representational) compliance. The former is
deﬁned as the capacity to be driven by external physical
action, which can be conforming or conﬂicting with the
intended action; whereas the later involves the ﬂexibility in
modifying the generative process according to information
from the ascending process, that is, the capacity to be driven
by sensory evidence (the inference process).
After having established the previous considerations, we
claim that the originality and main contribution of our
research is to study the relation between physical and cog-
nitive compliance in purposeful motor interaction. Within
the perspective of neurorobotics, we propose a variational
model, inspired by the principles of predictive coding and
active inference [9], to study intentionality and cognitive
compliance. We propose an intermittent control concept
for the study of motor deliberation and compliance that
takes into account torque feed-back. From the analysis of
interaction and behavior emergence in experiments with the
human-sized Torobo platform, we illustrate the relevance of
our work to the study of direct interaction, with interesting
perspectives for the bio-inspired approach to developmental
and social robotics.
II. RELATED WORK
Although independently developed, our research has been
consistent with the free energy principle theory [9]. In
[10] a deterministic hierarchical neural network architecture
operating on diﬀerent time scales (i.e. a Multiple Timescale
Recurrent Neural Network, or MTRNN) was proposed for
learning temporal sequences. Inspired by these ideas, be-
havior imitation was studied from visual and proprioceptive
representations (e.g. in [11]).
Inordertoimprovegeneralization,stochasticmodelinghas
been adopted where uncertainty in training data is learned as
a Gaussian distribution in the output layer [12]. However, a
limitation of this approach is the fact that the context layers
in the hierarchy remained deterministic.
The emergence of the variational Bayes auto-encoder
(VAE) framework [13] paved the way for optimizing in-
ference and learning probabilistic distributions in latent
arXiv:1911.01753v4  [cs.RO]  30 Jun 2020
variables, by re-parameterizing the variational lower bound.
This framework has been extended for studying on-line
interaction, as for example anticipating human behavior [14].
The predictive-coding-inspired variational recurrent neu-
ral network (PV-RNN) [15] has been proposed recently
in our lab. It is a variational model capable of learning
probabilistic structures in ﬂuctuating temporal patterns, by
modifying dynamically the stochasticity of the represented
latent states. Diﬀerent from VAEs, inputs are not propagated
in the network during forward computations. Instead, predic-
tion errors areback propagated through time(BPTT).
Unlike [11], where the robot imitates the human behavior
from visual input, our work is focused on direct physical
interaction based exclusively on the proprioceptive source of
information. Since our interest is to investigate autonomous
and possibly conﬂicting interaction, diﬀerent from [14], our
study does not focus on predicting the human behavior, but
on the inference process over proprioceptive representations.
Thus, the agent receives the human intentions through how
its body posture is changed within the interaction, which
characterizes a form of primary intersubjective experience
[16], as studied inembodied social cognition(ESC) theory.
III. COGNITIVE COMPLIANCE
As a variational framework, PV-RNN includes a gener-
ative and an inference model (see Fig. 1). The generative
model involves the prior distributions. It does hierarchical
predictions on the output layer following a top-down ﬂow.
That is, the prediction is generated from the information
represented in the latent state. The inference model involves
posterior distributions, so the information ﬂow goes in the
bottom-up sense. Predictions are done starting from the evi-
dence (i.e., a given observation), and the latent representation
is modiﬁed in order to approximate the evidence.

IV. MOTOR COMPLIANCE
In conformity with the principles of ethics in robotics
experiments, inspired by the famous Asimov’s three laws of
robotics [17], motor compliance is studied within the context
of social ethical conventions. Thus, the human and the robot
actions must preserve each other’s integrity and safety.
Computational theories of human control have pointed
out the plausibility of continuous and intermittent control
systems in the brain, with the latter being possibly driven by
events [18]. Intermittent control is related to the prefrontal
cortex, the premotor cortex, and the basal ganglia areas, it
has been studied in the context of postural regulation [19].
We model motor control as a hybrid intermittent process
driven by intentionality and social interaction. The rationale
behind this is the following. When contact between the
human and the robot is established, their intended motion
may complement or be to some extent incongruent. Thus,
in both the human and the robot cases, the body posture
must be adapted to the other’s inﬂuence to preserve a safe
interaction. Expressed in other terms, once external forces
acting on the body induce signiﬁcant joint torques, the joint
should exhibit viscoelasticity, so it becomes compliant to
the external force. Once the external constraints cease to be
relevant, active control should be resumed from a gradual
transition to the desired state. Hence, in this hybrid view,
each robot articulation is controllable instantaneously by one
of two possible schemes: a compliant and an active scheme.
Let the switching between the compliant and the active
modes of jointj at timet rely on a continuous observation
process of the torque ̂ j,t, and the prediction on the body
dynamics act
j,t . The estimation of the external torque induced
in the interaction is such that
̂ ext
j,t = ̂ j,t −act
j,t . (11)
Thus, switching to the compliant mode occurs onceð̂ ext
j,t ð >
th
j exceeds a thresholdth
j .
Let the joint position j,t be regulated by the active
control scheme in charge of tracking a reference position
net
j,t , intended by the agent (i.e. it is generated by the
neural network). The target position act
j,t+1, in relation to
the observation ̂j,t, is obtained from a discrete proportional
control law, such that
act
j,t+1 =a
j,t

net
j,t − ̂j,t

. (12)
Since j,t may diﬀer considerably from net
j,t under the
compliant scheme, in order to avoid abrupt motions, the
proportional gaina
j,t is set as the cosine transition modulated
by óóónet
j,t − ̂j,t
óóó, from a minimum to a maximum gain.
Let the joint positionj,t be regulated by the compliant
control scheme in charge of following the torque induced
by the human. A discrete time proportional integral (PI)
feedback control law with gainsp
j and i
j is adopted, so
ext

. (13)
In both the active and the compliant schemes the target
correction is saturated to preserve safety in behavior. Thus,
the functionf(.)acts as a reset windup to the integral term.
As explained before, due to the fact that the control is done
in the joint space, an interesting situation emerges where the
joints may be set to diﬀerent control schemes. Hence, the
human provides feedback to the robot through the compliant
joints, while receiving feedback about the robot’s intention
from the active joints. However, it is also interesting to
include soft impedance in the compliant joints in order to
enhance the interaction experience. Thus, the target position
in the compliant scheme is obtained such that

V. METHODOLOGY
On the robot side, the variables studied wereintentionality
(desired behavior in relation to the human’s actions) and
compliance in the physical (or motor, M) and the represen-
tational (or cognitive, C) dimensions. As shown in Table I,
several proﬁles were deﬁned to study compliance. Regarding
the motor dimension, the exclusively compliant modeMteach
was employed for kinesthetic demonstration of the behavior
primitives, and the interaction modeMinter was set based on
the hybrid controller (including the active and the compliant
schemes). Concerning the cognitive dimension, the proﬁles
Crigid, Cmod, and Cflex were deﬁned corresponding, respec-
tively, to a rigid, a moderate, and a ﬂexible agent.
TABLE I: The cognitive and motor proﬁles.
Proﬁle Description
Mteach Kinesthetic teaching (with the compliance scheme only)
Minter Interaction (with the active and compliant schemes)
Crigid Strong intentionality (w=0.01)
Cmod Moderate intentionality (w=0.001)
Cflex Low intentionality (w=0.0001)
The implementation of hybrid motor control in Torobo is
illustrated in Fig. 2. A dataset was constituted with three
behavior primitives (see Fig. 3), sampled at 4 Hz, during 90
time steps. The cognitive proﬁles in Table I were modeled in
the PV-RNN architecture (see Fig. 1). It included a Low layer
(40 d units, 4 z units, and=2) and a High layer (10 d units,
1 z unit, and = 10). All learnable variables were updated
during the training phase, whereas in interaction mode only
the terms a were updated (see Eqs. (6)(7)). Conforming to
Table I, speciﬁc values for w (Eq. (8)) were selected for
training (50K epochs). For interactionw=1.0e−5 was set
for all the proﬁles, since it produced the best results.
On the human side, the variables under study areintention-
ality (desired behavior in relation to the robot’s actions) and
engagement(physical eﬀorts invested in the task). Finally, on
the mutual interaction side, the variablebehavior emergence
(how similar the robot’s posture is to the known primitives)
is studied through a regression observer. Since the motion
primitives were reasonably diﬀerent from one another, a
feed-forward model was designed (12Input, 150Hidden1, 15
Hidden2, 3Output, with tanh activation for the hidden layers
and sigmoid activation for the output layer), and trained by
supervised learning with the joint instantaneous positions. A
success rate of 100% was achieved in the test set.

were captured by kinesthetic demonstration with Torobo.
Experimental protocol: Six scenarios were portrayed
conforming the pairs AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB; with the
left term representing the robot’s intended behavior, and the
right term corresponding to the human intended behavior
(the subject was instructed to induce a given primitive in the
robot behavior). For example, AB means the robot wants to
do A and the human wants to do B. A total of 54 trials were
registered for the experimental subject (6 pairs x 3 cognitive
models x 3 times), during 300 time steps each.
Software platform: The open-source implementation
of the models is provided by the neural robotics library
[20]. From previous experiences [21], C++ was chosen as
the base programming language. The programs run in the
Robot Operative System (ROS) Kinetic Kane over Ubuntu
16.04 LTS. The Network block (Fig. 2) ran at 4 Hz in the
host computer (Alienware Aurora R7, 12 Intel® Core™ i7-
8700K CPU at 3.70GHz, and 31.1 GiB RAM memory).
In interaction mode, BPTT was computed within a sliding
window (20 time steps) during 28 epochs. The models
learned 12 degrees of freedom (6 for each arm), constant
desired references were given to the torso and the head joints.
VI. RESULTS
The training results are shown in Fig. 4. As noticed,
although the reconstruction component of the ELBO (see Eq.
(8)) approached to zero in all cases, which indicates good
predictions from the posterior distribution; the smaller the
meta-parameter w was set (right plot), the more dissimilar
the posterior and the prior distributions were, which implies
more stochasticity in the generative process.

A. Simulations
Two preliminary studies were conducted. The ﬁrst one
investigated the accuracy of the generative process. For this,
the primitives were generated during 90 time steps (the same
length of the captured sequences in the dataset) by each
cognitive model (see Table I). The comparison is done by
calculating at each time step the mean squared error (MSE)
between the referencēxand the generatedxsequences. The
models Crigid and Cmod performed similarly well (see Fig.
5), whereasCflex had a more stochastic generative process.

diﬀerence between the model’s prediction and recorded joint
positions of A, B, and C. What is being analyzed is the
possibility of transition from the generation of one primitive
to another, given the evidence. That is, to what extent
stochasticity from the hidden random distributions, received
through the parameters a (see Eqs. (6)(7)), is allowed to
aﬀect the contextual representation during on-line inference.
All transitions could be obtained, except from BC with
Crigid. As noticed, Cflex representations were simpler, and
converged faster to conform the evidence.

The performance of the intermittent controller for congru-
ent and incongruent interaction is shown in Fig. 7. As no-
ticed, smooth trajectories resulted from tracking the network
signal while complying to the external torque induced by the
human. Table II compares emergent behavior to the robot’s
intended behavior for the three cognitive agents, based on
the regression observer’s evaluation. Table III shows the
mean and standard deviation of the estimated external torque
during the experiment. In Fig. 8, emergent behavior for the
pair BC is compared to the intended behavior of the robot2.

C. Discussion
The results supported the plausibility to model distinct
cognitive styles through the meta parameter w. Thus, by
learning to strongly approximate the prior and posterior
distributions (see Fig 4), the rigid agent was able to generate
accurate behavior (see Fig 5), but it was less sensitive to
evidence. Indeed, it obtained greater diﬀerences between the
intended and observed behaviors (see Table II). Contrarily,
the ﬂexible agent was trained investing less eﬀorts in learning
to approximate these distributions, which resulted in stochas-
tic or hesitating behavior. The moderate agent presented a
good balance between accuracy and cognitive ﬂexibility.
When analyzing the human engagement in the interaction,
qualitative diﬀerences can be observed among the agents (see
Table III, the lowest mean values per trial are highlighted in
bold). Since the subject was instructed to induce as long
as possible a certain behavior, with the rigid agent eﬀorts
were probably more invested in modifying the robot posture
to encourage the generation of the desired primitive, given
the agent’s reluctance to change. Hence, the interactions were
arduous and relied mostly on the compliant component of the

hybrid motor control scheme. Considering the ﬂexible agent,
it likely adopted the desired posture shape, but eﬀorts were
required to keep consistent interaction. It was challenging
to induce gradual changes in behavior, due to erraticness
and loss of bilateral symmetry, which would explain the
disparity of simulated and experimental results. In relation
to the moderate agent, smoother interactions were obtained
and less eﬀorts appeared to be invested, since the agent was
able to both change the posture and generate the behavior
consistently.Finally,inagreementwith [7],learningprobably
occurred on the human side, since bothp(I)and p(B)were
generally larger from the ﬁrst to the third trials.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This work focused on the study of physical interaction
between a human and a robot, and considered both co-
herent and incoherent scenarios. An important distinction
was established between motor and cognitive compliance.
A variational model, inspired by the principles of predictive
coding and active inference, was proposed to model cognitive
compliance as the capacity to be driven by sensory evidence.
An intermittent control concept was proposed to study motor
deliberation while adapting to the human interaction, based
on torque feed-back. The experiments results pointed out
a trade-oﬀ between cognitive compliance and reﬁnement
in autonomous motion. We believe that this trade-oﬀ can
be explored in developmental robotics to investigate on-line
learning [7]. From the perspective of human-robot interaction
research, our results would also open interesting possibilities
for the study of social cognition in human science, including
topics inmotivation [22] andintersubjectivity [20].
