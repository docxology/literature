We have described interaction enactment as the
agent’s capability of taking deliberative action while
conforming or adjusting to the actions induced by the
partner. Consequently, behavior emerges only partly
under the volitional control of the agent. We have pro-

of FEP theory which is consistent with autopoietic en-
