Abstract
This paper presents the computational methods of information cohomology applied to genetic expression in
[125, 16, 17] and in the companion paper [16] and proposes its interpretations in terms of statistical physics and
machine learning. In order to further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information functions
and chain rules, following [13, 14, 133], the computation of the cohomology in low degrees is detailed to
show more directly that the k multivariate mutual-informations ( Ik) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles
condition corresponds to Ik = 0, which generalize statistical independence to arbitrary dimension k [16].
Hence the cohomology can be interpreted as quantifying the statistical dependences and the obstruction to
factorization. The topological approach allows to investigate Shannon’s information in the multivariate case
without the assumptions of independent identically distributed variables and of statistical interactions without
mean ﬁeld approximations. We develop the computationally tractable subcase of simplicial information
cohomology represented by entropy Hk and information Ik landscapes and their respective paths. The I1
component deﬁnes a self-internal energy functional Uk, and ( −1)kIk,k≥2 components deﬁne the contribution
to a free energy functional Gk (the total correlation) of the k-body interactions. The set of information
paths in simplicial structures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes, provides a
trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The local minima of free-energy, related
to conditional information negativity, and conditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy
complex. This complex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a deﬁnition of
a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local minima that quantiﬁes the diversity observed in
biology. I give an interpretation of this complex in terms of frustration in glass and of Van Der Walls k-body
interactions for data points.
”Now what is science? ...it is before all a
classiﬁcation, a manner of bringing together
facts which appearances separate, though they
are bound together by some natural and hidden
kinship. Science, in other words, is a system of
relations. ...it is in relations alone that
objectivity must be sought. ...it is relations
alone which can be regarded as objective.
External objects... are really objects and not
ﬂeeting and fugitive appearances, because they
are not only groups of sensations, but groups
cemented by a constant bond. It is this bond,
and this bond alone, which is the object in itself,
and this bond is a relation.”

1 Introduction
The present paper has no deep mathematical or novelty pretension and just aims to present some computational
aspects and applications to data of the simplicial simplest special case of the cohomology theory developed in
[13, 16] and extended by Vigneaux [133, 135] to Tsallis entropies and diﬀerential entropy (etc.). The direct ap-
plication to genetic expression measures, performance in cell type or gene module detection and its relevance in
epigenetic co-regulation and diﬀerentiation terms can be ﬁnd in [125]. In its application to empirically measured
data, information cohomology is at the cross-road of both data analysis and statistical physics, and I aim to give
some keys of its interpretation within those two ﬁelds, what could be quoted as ”passing the information between
disciplines” in reference to Mezard’s review [95].
Unsupervised neural network learning: the original work based on spin networks by Hopﬁeld [59] formalized
fully recurrent networks as nbinary random variables (N = 2). Ackley, Hinton and Sejnowski [1] followed up by
imposing the Markov Field condition, allowing the introduction of conditional independence to handle network
structures with hidden layers and hidden nodes. The result, the Boltzmann or Helmholtz machine [36], relies on
the maximum entropy or free-energy minimization principle, and originally on minimizing the relative entropy
between the network and environmental states [1]. The informational approach of topological data analysis pro-
vides a direct probabilistic and statistical analysis of the structure of a dataset which allows to bridge the gap
with neural networks analysis, and may be to go a step beyond their formalization in mathematic. Indeed, as
proposed in [12] and references therein (notably see the whole opus of Marcolli with application to linguistic),
there are some reasons to believe that artiﬁcial or natural cognition could be homological by nature. Considering
neuron as binary random variables provides in the present context an homologically constrained approach of
those neural networks where the ﬁrst input layer is represented by the marginal (single variable, degree 1 com-
ponent) while hidden layers are associated to higher degrees. In a very naive sense higher cohomological degrees
distinguish higher order patterns (or higher dimensional patterns in the simplicial case), just as receptive ﬁelds
of neural networks recognize higher order features when going to higher depth-rank of neural layers as described
in David Marr’s original sketch [88], and now implemented eﬃciently in deep network structures. Here, in order
to allow a direct interpretation of the information topology in standard terms of machine learning; I provide an
energy functional interpretation of Mutual Information Ik and of Total Correlation Gk functions. Notably, the
introduction of this multiplicity of ”energy functions” broaden common unsupervised methods in neural network
: instead of a single energy and associated gradient descent, Mutual informations provide a combinatorial family
of analytically independent functions with independent gradients (see [16] for associated theorems). The scope is
restricted to unsupervised learning here, but the supervised subcase with explicit homological information ver-
sion of the back propagation chain rule, can be readily inferred from this and will be detailed with data analysis
examples in future publication and illustrated here [15]. Notably, the mathematical depth of back-propagation
algorithm [68, 38, 114] comes from the fact that it implements the chain rule for derivation with respect to the
parameters, allowing to learn in the class of diﬀerentiable functions. In the information cohomological reformu-
lation, the chain rule becomes the chain rule of mutual-information that are coboundaries (commonly diﬀerential
operator), parameters are provided by the label-teaching variables.

Statistical physics: On the

side of statistical physics, the generalization of binary neuronal-ising models to arbitrary multivalued variables
with Ni values corresponds to the generalization of spin models to Potts models [143]. Such generalization is per-
tinent for biological systems in general, since coding and meaningful variables in biology are usually non-digital
and only in quite exceptional cases binary. More interestingly, Mutual-Information negativity, a phenomenon
known to provide the signature of frustrated states in glasses since the work of Matsuda [89], is related here, in the
context of the more general conditional mutual information, to a kind of ﬁrst order transition, yet seen topolog-
ically as the critical points of a simplicial complex. We propose to analyse the statistical interactions quantiﬁed
by Mutual-Informations in full analogy with the Van Der Walls interaction model while leaving any homogeneous
or mean-ﬁeld assumptions on the variable. This observation makes coincide two phenomena, condensation in
statistical physics and clustering in data science. We hence further suggest that the Mutual-Informations func-
tions and homology should be peculiarly useful in the study of frustrated states and other related problems (see
Mezard and Montanari [96]), and for data points clustering.
Topological Data Analysis: On the side of applied algebraic topology, the identiﬁcation of the topological
structures of dataset has motivated important researches following the development of persistent homology [81,
44, 28]. Combining in a single framework statistical and topological structures remains an active challenge of
data analysis that already gave some interesting results [102, 27]. Some recent works have proposed information
theoretical approaches grounded on homology, deﬁning persistent entropy [32, 93], graph’s topological entropy
[122], spectral entropy [83], or multilevel Integration entropies [84]. Although the present work is formally diﬀerent
and arose independently of persistence methods, it is possible to provide an intuitive non-rigorous interpretation
in persistence terms. Most of the persistent methods consist in approximating the birth and death of the Betti’s
numbers of the ˘Cech complex obtained by considering balls around each data point while the radius of the ball
grows. The ˘Cech complex is given by the intersection of the balls, and for combinatorial computational reasons,
most of the algorithm restrict to pairwise intersections giving the Vietoris-Ripps complex as an approximation
of the ˘Cech complex. Our method focuses on intersection of random variables rather than balls around data
points: a theorem of Hu Kuo Ting [60] (recalled in [16]) shows the equivalence of mutual information functions
with set theoretic ﬁnite measurable functions endowed with the intersection operator, formalizing the naive
Venn diagram usual interpretation of mutual informations. Hence, leaving the mathematical rigor to allow an
interpretation of the current algorithm in the common language of persistence: I compute here an information
theoretic analog of the ˘Cech complex, and it is not excluded that such analogy can be made formal, and notably
to establish some nerve theorem for information structures (see Oudot for review [104]). It turns out that ”zero
information intersections” is exactly equivalent to statistical independence (theorem 1.2 [16]). Hence, in regard
to current topological data analysis methods, the methods presented here provides an intrinsically probabilistic
cohomological framework: the diﬀerential operators are fundamental maps in probability-information theory. As
a consequence, no metric assumption is required apriori: in practice it is possible to compute the homology for
example on position variables and-or on qualitative variable such as ”nice” and ”not nice”. The present method
is topological and avoids the introduction a priori of such a metric: rather, a family of Shannon’s pseudometric
emerges from the formalism as a ﬁrst cohomological class (cf. section 2.3.1): considering a symmetric action of
conditioning, we obtain Shannon’s metric parametrized by a scalar multiplicative constant. Notably, the notion
of geodesic used in machine learning is replaced by the homotopical notion of path. On the data analysis side,
it provides new algorithm and tools for Topological Data Analysis allowing to rank, detect clusters, functional
modules and to make dimensionality reduction; all these classical tasks in data analysis have indeed a direct
homological meaning. I propose to call the data analysis methods presented here, the Poincar´ e-Shannon machine,
since it implements simplicial homology and information theory in a single framework, applied eﬀectively to
empirical data.
2 Information cohomology
This section provides a short bibliographical note on the inscription of information and probability theory within
homological theories 2.1. We also recall the deﬁnition of information functions 2.2 and provide a short description
of information cohomology computed in the low degrees 2.3, such that the interpretation of entropy and mutual-
informations within Hochschild cohomology appears straightforward and clear. There is no new result in this
section, but I hope a more simple and helpful presentation for some researchers outside the ﬁeld of topology, of
what can be ﬁnd in [13, 133, 135] that should be considered for more precise and detailed exposition.

2.1 A long march through information topology
From the mathematical point of view, a motivation of information topology is to capture the ambiguity theory
of Galois, which is the essence of group theory or discrete symmetries (see Andr´ e’s reviews [4, 5]), and Shannon’s
information uncertainty theory in a common framework, a path already paved by some results on information
inequalities (see Yeung’s results [146]) and in algebraic geometry. In the work of Cathelineau, [30], entropy ﬁrst
appeared in the computation of the degree one homology of the group SL(2,C) with coeﬃcients in the adjoint
action by choosing a pertinent deﬁnition of the derivative of the Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm. It could be shown
that the functional equation with 5-terms of the dilogarithm implies the functional equation of entropy with
4-terms. Kontsevitch [72] discovered that a ﬁnite truncated version of the logarithm appearing in cyclotomic
studies also satisﬁed the functional equation of entropy, suggesting a higher degree generalization of information,
analog to polylogarithm, and hence showing that the functional equation of entropy holds in p and 0 ﬁeld
characteristics. Elbaz-Vincent and Gangl used algebraic means to construct this information generalization
which holds over ﬁnite ﬁelds [42], and where information functions appear as derivations [43]. After entropy
appeared in tropical and idempotent semi-ring analysis in the study of the extension of Witt semiring to the
characteristic 1 limit [33], Marcolli and Thorngren developed thermodynamic semiring, and entropy operad that
could be constructed as deformation of the tropical semiring [86]. Introducing Rota-Baxter algebras, it allowed
to derive a renormalization procedure [85]. Baez, Fritz and Leinster deﬁning the category of ﬁnite probability
and using Fadeev axiomatization, could show that the only family of functions that has the functorial property
is Shannon information loss [9, 11]. Boyom, basing his approach on information and Koszul geometry, developed
a more geometrical view of statistical models that notably considers foliations in place of the random variables
[25]. Introducing a deformation theoretic framework, and chain complex of random variables, Drumond-Cole,
Park and Terilla [39, 40, 105] could construct a homotopy probability theory for which the cumulants coincide
with the morphisms of the homotopy algebras. A probabilistic framework, used here, was introduced in [13],
and generalized to Tsallis entropies by Vigneaux [133, 135]. The diversity of the formalisms employed in these
independent but convergent approaches is astonishing. So, to the question what is information topology, it is
only possible to answer that it is under development at the moment. The results of Catelineau, Elbaz-Vincent
and Gangl inscribed information into the theory of motives, which according to Beilison’s program is a mixed
Hodge-Tate cohomology [18]. All along the development of the application to data, following the cohomology
developed by [13, 133] on an explicit probabilistic basis, we aimed to preserve such a structure and unravel its
expression in information theoretic terms. Moreover, following Aomoto’s results [7, 53], the actual conjecture [13]
is that the higher classes of information cohomology should be some kind of polylogarithmic k-form (k-diﬀerential
volume that are symmetric and additive, and that correspond to the cocycle conditions for the cohomology of
Lie groups [7]). The following developments suggest that these higher information groups should be the families
of functions satisfying the functional equations of k-independence Ik = 0, a rather vague but intuitive view that
can be tested in special cases.
2.2 Information functions (deﬁnitions)
The information functions used in [13] and the present study were originally deﬁned by Shannon [117] and
Kullback [74] and further generalized and developed by Hu Kuo Ting [60] and Yeung [147] (see also McGill [92]).
These functions include entropy, noted H1 = H(X; P), joint entropy, noted Hk = H(X1,...,X k; P), mutual-
information noted I2 = I(X1; X2; P), multivariate k-mutual-information, noted Ik = I(X1; ...; Xk; P) and the
conditional entropy and mutual information, noted Y.Hk = H(X1,...,X k|Y; P) and Y.Ik = I(X1; ...; Xk|Y; P).
The classical expression of these functions is the following (using k= −1/ln 2, the usual bit unit):
• The Shannon-Gibbs entropy of a single variable Xj is deﬁned by [117]:
H1 = H(Xj; PXj ) = k
∑
x∈[Nj]
p(x) lnp(x) = k
Nj∑
i=1
piln pi (1)
where [Nj] = {1,...,N j}denotes the alphabet of Xj.
• The relative entropy or Kullback-Liebler divergence, which was also called ”discrimination information” by
Kullback [74], is deﬁned for two probability mass function p(x) and q(x) by:
D(p(x)||q(x)) = D(X; p(x)||q(x)) = k
∑
x∈X
p(x) ln q(x)
p(x)
= H(X; p(x),q(x)) −H(X; p(x))
(2)
where H(X; p(x),q(x)) is the cross-entropy and H(X; p(x)) the Shannon entropy. It hence generates as a
special case minus entropy, taking the deterministic constant probability q(x) = 1. With the convention
k= −1/ln 2, D(p(x)||q(x)) is always positive or null.
4
• The joint entropy is deﬁned for any joint-product of k random variables (X1,...,X k) and for a probability
joint-distribution P(X1,...,Xk) by [117]:
Hk = H(X1,...,X k; PX1,...,Xk )
= k
N1×...×Nk∑
x1,...,xk∈[N1×...×Nk]
p(x1.....xk) lnp(x1.....xk)
= k
N1,...,Nk∑
i,j,...,k
pij...k
k indices
ln pij...k
(3)
where [N1 ×...×Nk] = {1,...,N j ×...×Nk}denotes the alphabet of ( X1,...,X k).
• The mutual information of two variables X1,X2 is deﬁned as [117]:
I(X1; X2; PX1,X2 ) = k
N1×N2∑
x1,x2∈[N1×N2]
p(x1.x2) ln p(x1)p(x2)
p(x1.x2) (4)
And it can be generalized to k-mutual-information (also called co-information) using the alternated sums
given by equation 17, as originally deﬁned by McGill [92] and Hu Kuo Ting [60], giving:
Ik = I(X1; ...; Xk; P) = k
N1×...×Nk∑
x1,...,xk∈[N1×...×Nk]
p(x1.....xk) ln
∏
I⊂[k];card(I)=i;i odd pI
∏
I⊂[k];card(I)=i;i even pI
(5)
For example, the 3-mutual information is the function:
I3 = k
N1×N2×N3∑
x1,x2,x3∈[N1×N2×N3]
p(x1.x2.x3) ln p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x1.x2.x3)
p(x1.x2)p(x1.x3)p(x2.x3) (6)
For k≥3, Ik can be negative [60].
• The total correlation introduced by Watanabe [138], called integration by Tononi and Edelman [130]
or multi-information by Studen´ y and Vejnarova [121] and Margolin and colleagues [87], which we note
Ck(X1; ...Xk; P), is deﬁned by:
Ck = Ck(X1; ...Xk; P) =
k∑
i=1
H(Xi) −H(X1; ...Xk) =
k∑
i=2
(−1)i ∑
I⊂[n];card(I)=i
Ii(XI; P)
= k
N1×...×Nk∑
x1,...,xk∈[N1×...×Nk]
p(x1....xk) ln p(x1...xk)
p(x1)...p(xk)
(7)
For two variables the total correlation is equal to the mutual-information ( C2 = I2). The total correlation
has the nice property of being a relative entropy 2 between marginal and joint-variable and hence to be
always non-negative.
• The conditional entropy of X1 knowing (or given) X2 is deﬁned as [117]:
X2.H1 = H(X1|X2; P) = k
N1∗N2∑
x1,x2∈[N1×N2]
p(x1.x2) lnpx2 (x1)
= k
N2∑
x2∈X2
p(x2).
( N1∑
x1∈X1
px2 x1 ln px2 x1
)
(8)
Conditional joint-entropy,X3.H(X1,X2) or (X1,X2).H(X3), is deﬁned analogously by replacing the marginal
probabilities by the joint probabilities.
• The conditional mutual information of two variables X1,X2 knowing a third X3 is deﬁned as [117]:
X3.I2 = I(X1; X2|X3; P) = k
N1×N2×N3∑
x1,x2,x3∈[N1×N2×N3]
p(x1.x2.x3) ln px3 (x1)px3 (x2)
px3 (x1,x2) (9)
Conditional mutual information generates all the preceding information functions as subcases, as shown by
Yeung [147]. We have the theorem : if X3 = Ω then it gives the mutual information, if X2 = X1 it gives
conditional entropy, and if both conditions are satisﬁed, it gives entropy. Notably, we have I1 = H1.
5
We now give the few information equalities and inequalities that are of central use in the homological frame-
work, in the information diagrams and for the estimation of the informations from the data.
We have the chain rules (see [35] for proofs):
H(X1; X2; P) = H(X1; P) + X1.H(X2; P) = H(X2; P) + X2.H(X1; P) (10)
I(X1; X2; P) = H(X1; P) −X2.H(X1; P) = H(X2; P) −X1.H(X2; P) (11)
That we can write more generally (where the hat denotes the omission of the variable):
H(X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1; P) = H(X1; ...; Xk+1; P) −(X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1).H(Xi; P) (12)
That we can write in short Hk+1 −Hk = (X1,...Xk).H(Xk+1)
I(X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1; P) = I(X1; ...; Xk+1; P) + Xi.I(X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1; P) (13)
That we can write in short Ik−1 −Ik = Xk.Ik−1, generating the chain rule 10 as special case.
These two equations provide recurrence relationships that give an alternative formulation of the chain rules
in terms of a chosen path on the lattice of information structures:
Hk = H(X1,...,X k; P) =
k∑
i=1
(X1,...,X i−1).H(Xi; P) (14)
where we assume H(X1; P) = X0.H(X1; P) and hence that X0 is the greatest element X0 = Ω.
Ik = I(X1; ...; Xk; P) = I(X1) −
k∑
i=2
Xi.I(X1; ...; Xi−1) (15)
We have the alternated sums or inclusion-exclusion rules [60, 89, 13]:
Hn(X1,...,X n; P) =
n∑
i=1
(−1)i−1 ∑
I⊂[n];card(I)=i
Ii(XI; P) (16)
In(X1; ...; Xn; P) =
n∑
i=1
(−1)i−1 ∑
I⊂[n];card(I)=i
Hi(XI; P) (17)
For example: H3(X1,X2,X3) = I1(X1)+ I1(X2)+ I1(X3)−I2(X1; X2)−I2(X1; X3)−I2(X2; X3)+ I3(X1; X2; X3)
The chain rule of mutual-information goes together with the following inequalities discovered by Matsuda
[89]. For all random variables X1; ..; Xk with associated joint probability distribution P we have:
• Xk.I(X1; ..; Xk−1; P) ≥0 if and only if I(X1; ..; Xk−1; P) ≥I(X1; ..; Xk; P) (in short: Ik−1 ≥Ik )
• Xk.I(X1; ..; Xk−1; P) <0 if and only if I(X1; ..; Xk−1; P) <I (X1; ..; Xk; P) (in short: Ik−1 <Ik )
that fully characterize the phenomenon of information negativity as an increasing or diverging sequence of mutual
information.
2.3 Information structures and coboundaries
This section justiﬁes the choice of functions and algorithm, the topological nature of the data analysis and the
approximations we had to concede for the computation. In the general formulation of information cohomology,
the random variables are partitions of the atomic probabilities of a ﬁnite probability space (Ω ,B,P) (e.g. all
their equivalence classes). The Joint-Variable (X1,X2) is the less ﬁne partition that is ﬁner than X1 and X2;
the whole lattice of partitions Π [6] corresponds to the lattice of joint random variables [48, 13]. Then, a general
information structure is deﬁned to be the triple (Ω,Π,P). A more modern and general expression in category
theory and topos is given in [13, 133]. ( X1,...,X k; P) designates the image law of the probability P by the
measurable function of joint variables ( X1,...,X k). Figure 1 gives a simple example of the lattice of partitions
for 4 atomic probabilities, with the simplicial sublattice used for data analysis. Atomic probabilities are also
illustrated in a Figure the associated paper [16].
On this general information structure, we consider the real module of all measurable functionsF(X1,...,X k; P),
and the conditioning-expectation by Y of measurable functions as the action ofY on the functional module, noted
Y.F(X1,...,X k; P), such that it corresponds to the usual deﬁnition of conditional entropy (equ. 8). We deﬁne

representing the random variables. The joint operation of Random Variables noted ( X,Y ) or X ⊗Y of two
partitions is the less ﬁne partition Z that is ﬁner than X and Y (Z divides Y and X, or Z is the greatest
common divisor of Y and X). It is represented by the coincidence of two edges of the lattices. The joint
operation has an identity element noted 1 = Ω (that we will note 0 thereafter), with X,1 = X,Ω = X and is
idempotent (X,X) = X2 = X. The structure is a partially ordered set (poset) with a reﬁnement relation. b,

where ∂k is the left action co-boundary that Hochschild proposed for associative and ring structures [57]. A
similar construction of random variable complex was given by Drumond-Cole, Park and Terilla [39, 40]. We
consider also the two other directly related cohomologies that are deﬁned by considering a trivial left action [13]
and a symmetric (left and right) action [52, 139, 67] of conditioning:

(∂k)F(X1; X2; ...; Xk+1; P) = X1.F(X2; ...; Xk+1; P)
+

i=1
(−1)iF(X1; X2; ...; (Xi,Xi+1); ...; Xk+1; P)
+ (−1)k+1F(X1; ...; Xk; P)
(18)
This coboundary, with a trivial right action, is the usual coboundary of Galois cohomology ([126], p.2), and
in general it is the coboundary of homological algebra obtained by Cartan and Eilenberg [29] and MacLane
[82] (non homogenous bar complex).
• The ”topological-trivial” Hochschild-information coboundary and cohomology: considering a trivial left
action in the preceding setting , e.g. X1.F(X2; ...; Xk+1) = F(X2; ...; Xk+1). It is the subset of the
preceding case, which is invariant under the action of conditioning. We obtain the topological coboundary
(∂k
t) [13]:
(∂k
t)F(X1; X2; ...; Xk+1; P) = F(X2; ...; Xk+1; P)

i=1
(−1)iF(X1; X2; ...; (Xi,Xi+1); ...; Xk+1; P)
+ (−1)k+1F(X1; ...; Xk; P)
(19)
• The symmetric Hochschild-information coboundary and cohomology: as introduced by Gerstenhaber and
Shack [52], Kassel [67] (p.13) and Weibel [139] (chap.9), we consider a symmetric (left and right) action of
conditioning, that is X1.F(X2; ...; Xk+1) = F(X2; ...; Xk+1).X1. The left action module is essentially the
same as considering a symmetric action bimodule [52, 67, 139]. We hence obtain the following symmetric

coboundary (∂k
∗):

(−1)iF(X1; X2; ...; (Xi,Xi+1); ...; Xk+1; P)
+ (−1)k+1Xk+1.F(X1; ...; Xk; P)
(20)
Based on these deﬁnitions, Baudot and Bennequin [13] computed the ﬁrst homology class in the left action
Hochschild-information cohomology case and the coboundaries in higher degrees. We introduce here the sym-
metric case, and detail the higher degree cases by direct specialization of the co-boundaries formulas, such that it
appears that information functions and chain rules are homological by nature. For notation clarity, we omit the
probability in the writing of the functions, and when speciﬁcally stated replace their notation F by their usual
corresponding informational function notation H,I.
2.3.1 ﬁrst degree (k=1)
For the ﬁrst degree k= 1, we have the following results:
• The left 1-co-boundary is ( ∂1)F(X1; X2) = X1.F(X2) −F(X1,X2) + F(X1). The 1-cocycle condition
(∂1)F(X1; X2) = 0 gives F(X1,X2) = F(X1) + X1.F(X2), which is the chain rule of information shown
in equation 10. Then, following Kendall [69] and Lee [78], it is possible to recover the functional equation
of information and to characterize uniquely, up to the arbitrary multiplicative constant k, the entropy
(equation 1) as the ﬁrst class of cohomology [13, 133]. This main theorem allows us to obtain the other
information functions in what follows. Marcolli and Thorngren [86], Leinster, Fritz and Baez [11, 9] obtained
independently an analog result using measure-preserving function and characteristic one Witt construction,
respectively. In these various theoretical settings, this result extends to relative entropy [86, 11, 13], and
Tsallis entropies [86, 133].
• The topological 1-coboundary ( ∂1
t) is ( ∂1
t)F(X1; X2) = F(X2) −F(X1,X2) + F(X1), which corresponds
to the deﬁnition of mutual information ( ∂1
t)F(X1; X2) = I(X1; X2) = H(X1) + H(X2) −H(X1,X2), and
hence I2 is a topological 1-coboundary.
• The symmetric 1-coboundary ( ∂1
∗) is ( ∂1
∗)F(X1; X2) = X1.F(X2) −F(X1,X2) + X2.F(X1), which cor-
responds to the negative of the pairwise mutual information ( ∂1
∗)F(X1; X2) = X2.H(X1) + X1.H(X2) −
H(X1,X2) = −I(X1; X2), and hence −I2 is a symmetric 1-coboundary. Moreover, the 1-cocycle con-
dition ( ∂1
∗)F(X1; X2) = 0 characterizes functions satisfying F(X1,X2) = X2.F(X1) + X1.F(X2), which
corresponds to the information pseudo-metric discovered by Shannon [116], Rajski [110], Zurek [150] and
Bennett [21], and has further been applied for hierarchical clustering and ﬁnding categories in data by
Kraskov and Grassberger [73]: H(X1 △X2) = X2.H(X1) + X1.H(X2) = H(X1,X2) −I(X1; X2). There-
fore, up to an arbitrary scalar multiplicative constant k, the information pseudo-metric H(X1 △X2) is the
ﬁrst class of symmetric cohomology. This pseudo metric is represented in the Figure . It generalizes to
pseudo k-volumes that we deﬁne by Vk = Hk −Ik (particularly interesting symmetric functions computed
by the provided software).
2.3.2 Second degree (k=2)
For the second degree k= 2, we have the following results:
•The left 2-co-boundary is∂2F(X1; X2; X3) = X1.F(X2; X3)−F((X1,X2); X3)+F(X1; (X2,X3))−F(X1; X2),
which corresponds to minus the 3-mutual information∂2F(X1; X2; X3) = X1.I(X2; X3)−I((X1,X2); X3)+
I(X1; (X2,X3)) −I(X1; X2) = −I(X1; X2; X3), and hence −I3 is left 2-coboundary.
•The topological 2-coboundary is ( ∂2
t)F(X1; X2; X3) = F(X2; X3) −F((X1,X2); X3) + F(X1; (X2,X3)) −
F(X1; X2), which corresponds in information to∂2
tF(X1; X2; X3) = I(X2; X3)−I((X1,X2); X3)+I(X1; (X2,X3))−
I(X1; X2) = 0, and hence the topological 2-coboundary is always null-trivial.
• The symmetric 2-coboundary is (∂2
∗)F(X1; X2; X3) = X1.F(X2; X3)−F((X1,X2); X3)+ F(X1; (X2,X3))−
X3.F(X1; X2), which corresponds in information to ∂2
∗F(X1; X2; X3) = X1.I(X2; X3) −I((X1,X2); X3) +
I(X1; (X2,X3)) −X3.I(X1; X2) = 0, and hence the symmetric 2-coboundary is always null-trivial.

2.3.3 Third degree (k=3)
For the third degree k= 3, we have the following results:
• The left 3-co-boundary is∂3F(X1; X2; X3; X4) = X1.F(X2; X3; X4)−F((X1,X2); X3; X4)+F(X1; (X2,X3); X4)−
F(X1; X2; (X3,X4))+F(X1; X2; X3), which corresponds in information to∂3F(X1; X2; X3; X4) = X1.I(X2; X3; X4)−
I((X1,X2); X3; X4) + I(X1; (X2,X3); X4) −I(X1; X2; (X3,X4)) + I(X1; X2; X3) = 0, and hence the left
3-coboundary is always null-trivial.
• The topological 3-coboundary is∂3
tF(X1; X2; X3; X4) = F(X2; X3; X4)−F((X1,X2); X3; X4)+F(X1; (X2,X3); X4)−
F(X1; X2; (X3,X4))+F(X1; X2; X3), which corresponds in information to∂3
tF(X1; X2; X3; X4) = I(X2; X3; X4)−
I((X1,X2); X3; X4) +I(X1; (X2,X3); X4) −I(X1; X2; (X3,X4)) +I(X1; X2; X3) = I(X1; X2; X3; X4), and
hence I4 is a topological 3-coboundary.
• The symmetric 3-coboundary is (∂3
∗)F(X1; X2; X3; X4) = X1.F(X2; X3; X4)−F((X1,X2); X3; X4)+F(X1; (X2,X3); X4)−
F(X1; X2; (X3,X4)) + X4.F(X1; X2; X3), which corresponds in information to ∂3
∗F(X1; X2; X3; X4) =
X1.I(X2; X3; X4) −I((X1,X2); X3; X4) +I(X1; (X2,X3); X4) −I(X1; X2; (X3,X4)) +X4.I(X1; X2; X3) =
−I(X1; X2; X3; X4), and hence −I4 is a symmetric 3-coboundary.
2.3.4 Higher degrees
Fork= 4, we obtain∂4F(X1; X2; X3; X4; X5) = −I5, and ∂5
tF(X1; X2; X3; X4; X5) = 0 , and∂5
∗F(X1; X2; X3; X4; X5) =
0. For arbitrary k, the symmetric coboundaries are just the opposite of the topological coboundaries ∂k
t = −∂k
∗.
It is possible to generalize to arbitrary degrees [13] by remarking that we have:
•For even degrees 2 k: we have I2k = −∂tI2k−1 and then I2k = ∂t∂∂t...∂∂tH with 2k−1 boundary terms.
In conclusion, we have:
∂2kF = −I2k+1 and ∂2k
∗ F = −∂2k
t F = 0 (21)
•For odd degrees 2 k+ 1: I2k+1 = −∂I2k−1 and then I2k+1 = −∂∂t∂...∂∂tH with 2k boundary terms. In
conclusion, we have:
∂2k−1F = 0 and ∂2k−1
∗ F = −∂2k
t F = −I2k (22)
In [17, 16](theorem 1.2), we show that the mutual independence of n variables is equivalent to the vanishing
of all Ik functions for all 2 ≤k ≤n. As a probabilistic interpretation and conclusion, the information coho-
mology hence quantiﬁes statistical dependences at all degrees and the obstruction to factorization. Moreover,
k-independence coincides with cocycles. We therefore expect that the higher cocycles of information, conjectured
to be polylogarithmic forms [13, 43, 42], are characterized by the functional equations Ik = 0, and quantify
statistical k-independence.
3 Simplicial information cohomology
3.1 Simplicial substructures of information
The general information structure, relying on the information functions deﬁned on the whole lattice of parti-
tions, encompasses all possible statistical dependences and relations, since by deﬁnition it considers all possible
equivalent classes on a probability space. One could hence expect this general structure to provide the promising
theoretical framework for classiﬁcation tasks on data, and this is probably true in theory. However, this general
case hardly allows any interesting computational investigation as it implies an exhaustive exploration of computa-
tional complexity following Bell’s combinatoric in O(exp(exp(Nn))) for nN -ary variables. This fact was already
remarked in the study of aggregation for Artiﬁcial Intelligence by Lamarche-Perrin and colleagues [75]. At each
order k, the number of k-joint-entropy and k-mutual-information to evaluate is given by Stirling numbers of the
second kind S(n,k) that sum to Bell number Bn, Bn = ∑n
k=0 S(n,k). For example, considering 16 variables
that can take 8 values each, we have 816 = 248 ≈3.1014 atomic probabilities and the partition lattice of variables
exhibits around ee248
−1 ≥2200 elements to compute. Such computational reef can be decreased by considering
the sample-size m, which is the number of trials, repetitions or points that is used to eﬀectively estimate the
empirical probability. It restricts the computation to O(exp(exp(m)), which remains insurmountable in practice
with our current classical Turing machines. To circumvent this computational barrier, data analysis is developed
on the simplest and oldest subcase of Hochschild cohomology: the simplicial cohomology, which we hence call
the simplicial information cohomology and structure, and which corresponds to a subcase of cohomology and
structure introduced previously (see Figure 1b.). It corresponds to the example 1 and 4 in [13]. For simplicity,
we note also the simplicial information structure (Ω ,∆n,P), ∆n = (X1,...,X n; P), as we will not come back to
the general setting. Joint ( X1,X2) and meet ( X1; X2) operations on random variables are the usual joint-union
9
and meet-intersection of Boolean algebra and deﬁne two opposite-dual monoids, generating freely the lattice of
all subsets and its dual. The combinatorics of the simplicial information structure follow binomial coeﬃcients
and, for each degree k in an information structure of nvariables, we have
(n
k
)
= n!
k!(n−k!) elements that are in one
to one correspondence with the k-faces (the k-tuples) of the n-simplex of random variables (or its barycentric
subdivisions). It is a (simplicial) substructure of the general structure since any ﬁnite lattice is a sub-lattice of
the partition lattice [109]. This lattice embedding and the fact that simplicial cohomology is a special case of
Hochschild cohomology can also be inferred directly from their coboundary expression and has been explicitly
formalized in homology: notably, Gerstenhaber and Shack showed that a functor, noted Σ ↦→kΣ!, induces an
isomorphism between simplicial and Hochschild cohomology H•(Σ,k) ∼= H•(kΣ!,kΣ!) [51]. A simplicial complex
Xk = F(X1,...,X k; P) of measurable functions is any subcomplex of this simplex ∆ n with k ≤n, and any
simplicial complex can be realized as a subcomplex of a simplex (see Steenrod [119] p.296). The information
landscapes presented in Figure 3 illustrate an example of such a lattice/information structure. Moreover in this
ordinary homological structure, the degree obviously coincides with the dimension of the data space (the data
space is in general Rn, the space of ”co-ordinate” values of the variables). This homological (algebraic, geometric
and combinatorial) restriction to the simplicial subcase can have some important statistical consequences. In
practice, whereas the consideration of the partition lattice ensured that no reasonable (up to logical equivalence)
statistical dependences could be missed (since all the possible equivalence classes on the atomic probabilities
were considered), the monoidal simplicial structure unavoidably misses some possible statistical dependences as
shown and exempliﬁed by James and Crutchﬁeld [61].
3.2 Topological Self and Free Energy of k-body interacting system - Poincar´ e-
Shannon Machine
3.2.1 Topological Self and Free Energy of k-body interacting system
The basic idea behind the development of topological quantum ﬁeld theories [8, 142, 115] was to deﬁne the
action and energy functionals on a purely topological ground, independently of any metric assumptions, and
to derive from this the correlation functions or partition functions. Here, in an elementary model for applied
purposes, we deﬁne, in the special case of classical and discrete probability, the k-mutual-information Ik (that
generalize the correlation functions to nonlinear relation [111]), as the contribution of the k-body interactions
to the energy functional. Some further observations support such a deﬁnition: i) as stated in [13] (Th.D), the
signed mutual-informations (−1)kIk deﬁning energy are sub-harmonic, a kind of weak convexity ii) in the next
sections, we deﬁne the paths of information and show that they are equivalent to the discrete symmetry group
iii) from the empirical point of view, Figure 5 shows that these energy functionals estimated on real data behave
as expected for usual k-body homogeneous formalism such as Van-Der-Walls model, or more reﬁned Density
Functional Theory (DFT) [58, 70]. These deﬁnitions, given in the context of simplicial structures, generalize to
the case of partitions lattice, and altogether provide the usual thermodynamical and machine-learning expressions
and interpretation of mutual-information quantities: some new methods free of metric assumptions. There are
two qualitatively and formally diﬀerent components in the Ik :
• Self-internal information energy (deﬁnition): for k= 1, I1 and their sum in an information structure
expressed in equation 16, namely ∑
T⊂[n];card(T)=1 I1(XT; P), are a self-interaction component, since it
sums over marginal information-entropy I1(Xi) = H1(Xi). We call the ﬁrst dimension mutual informa-
tion component U(X1,...,X n; PN) the self information or internal information energy, in analogy to usual
statistical physics and notably DFT:
U(X1,...,X n; PN) =
n∑
i=1
I1(Xi; PN) (23)
Note that in the present context, which is discrete and where the interactions do not depend on a metric,
the self-interaction does not diverge, which is a usual problem with metric continuous formalism and was
the original motivation for regularization and renormalization inﬁnite corrections, considered by Feynman
and Dirac as the mathematical default of the formalism [47, 37].
• k-free-energy and total-free-energy (deﬁnition): for k≥2, (−1)kIk and their sum in an information
structure (equation 16) quantify the contribution of the k-body interactions. We call the k th dimension
mutual information component ( −1)kIk, given in equation 5, the k-free-information-energy. We call the
(cumulative) sum over dimensions of these k-free-information-energies starting at pairwise interactions
(dimension 2), the total n-free-information-energy, and note it G(X1,...,X n; PN):
G(X1,...,X n; PN) =
n∑
i=2
(−1)i−1 ∑
I⊂[n];card(I)=i
Ii(XI; PN) = Cn(X1; ...Xn; PN) (24)
10
The total free-energy is the total correlation (equation 7) introduced by Watanabe in 1960 [138] that
quantiﬁes statistical dependence in the work of Studen´ y and Vejnarova [121] and Margolin and colleagues
[87], and among other examples consciousness in the work of Tononi and Edelman [130]. In agreement with
the results of Baez and Pollard in their study of biological dynamics using out-of-equilibrium formalism
[10], and the appendix of the companion paper on Bayes Free Energy [16] the total free-energy is a relative
entropy. The consideration that free energy is the peculiar case of total correlation within the set of relative
entropies, accounts for the fact that the free energy shall be a symmetric function of the variables associated
to the various bodies, e.g f(X; Y) = f(Y; X) in the pairwise interaction case. Moreover, whereas Ik energy
component can be negative, the Gk total energy component is always non-negative. Each ( −1)kIk term in
the free energy can be understood as a free energy correction accounting for the k-body interactions.
Entropy is given by the alternated sums of information (equation 16), which then read as the usual isotherm
thermodynamic relation:
Hn(X1,...,X n; PN) = U(X1,...,X n; PN) −G(X1,...,X n; PN) (25)
This information theoretic formulation of thermodynamic relation follows Jaynes [63, 62], Landauer [77], Wheeler
[141], and Bennett’s[20] original work, and is general in the sense that it is ﬁnite and discrete, and holds inde-
pendently of the assumption of the system being in equilibrium or not, i.e. for whatever ﬁnite probability. In
more probabilistic terms, it does not assume that the variables are identically distributed, a condition that is
required for the application of classical central limit theorems (CLT) to obtain the normal distributions in the
asymptotic limit [136]. In the special case where one postulates that the probability follows the equilibrium
Gibbs distribution, which is also the maximum entropy distribution [41, 34], the expression of the joint-entropy
(k = −1/ln 2) allows to recover the equilibrium fundamental relation, as usually achieved in statistical physics
(see Adami and Cerf [3] and Kapranov [66] for more details). Explicitly, let’s consider the Gibb’s distribution:
p(X1 = x1,...,X n = xn) = pij...n
n indices

Ze−βEij...n/kBT (26)
where Eij...n is the energy of the elementary-atomic probability pij...n, kB is Boltzmann constant, T the tem-
perature and Z = ∑Ni.Nj...Nn
i,j,..,n e−Eij...n/kBT is the partition function, such that ∑Ni.Nj...Nn
i,j,..,n pij...n = 1. Since
H(X1,...,X n) = k∑Ni.Nj...Nn
i,j,..,n pij...nln pij...n, equals the thermodynamic entropy function S up to the arbitrary
Landauer constant factor kBln 2, S = kBln 2H(X1,...,X n), the entropy for Gibbs distribution gives:
H(X1,...,X n)/k=

i,j,..,n

N1.N2...Nn∑
i,j,..,n

, which gives the expected thermodynamical relation:
kBTln 2.H(X1,...,X n) = ⟨E⟩−G= U −G (28)
, where G is the free-energy G= −kBTln Z.
In the general case of arbitrary random variables (not necessarily iid) and discrete probability space, the identi-
ﬁcation of marginal informations with internal energy:
n∑
k=1
H(Xk) =
N1.N2...Nn∑
i,j,..,n

implies by direct algebraic calculus that:

( n∏

(30)
, where the marginal probability p••...k...•is the sum over all probabilities for whichXk = xk. It is hence tempting
to identify the elementary-atomic energies Eij...n with the elementary marginal informations ln p••...k...•. This
is achieved uniquely by considering that such an elementary energy function must satisfy the additivity axiom
(extensivity): (E(Xi = xi,Xj = xj) = Ei,j = Eij = Ei+ Ej), which is the functional equation of the logarithm.
The original proof goes back at least to Kepler, an elementary version was given by Erdos [45], and in Information
theory terms can be found in the proofs of uniqueness of ”single event information function” by Aczel and Darokzy
([2], p.3). It establishes the following proposition:
11
Theorem 3.1. Given a simplicial information structure, the elementary energies satisfying the extensivity axiom
are the functions:

, where k is an arbitrary constant settled to k= −1/ln 2 for units in bit.
The geometric meaning of these elementary energies as log of marginal elementary probability volumes (lo-
cally Euclidean) is illustrated in Figure 2 and further underlines that Ik,k≥2 are volume corrections accounting
for the statistical dependences among marginal variables.
Examples: i) in the example of 3 binary random variables ( n = 3 ,N1 = N2 = N3 = 2, three vari-

ables of Bernoulli) illustrated in the Figure of the associated paper [16], we have E000 = −ln(p0••p•0•p••0),
E000 = −ln(p000 + p010 + p001 + p011) −ln(p000 + p100 + p001 + p101) −ln(p000 + p100 + p010 + p110) and in the
conﬁguration of negative-entangled-Borromean information of the Figure of the associated paper [16], we obtain
E000 = 3 in bit units, and similarly E001 = E010 = E011 = E101 = E110 = E111 = 3, and we hence recover
U = ∑8
i,j,kpijkEijk = ∑3
i=1 H(Xi) = 3 bits. Note that the limit 0 ln 0 ∼0 avoids singularity of elementary
energies.
ii) in the special case of identically distributed variables, p••...k...• = p•...j...••, we have Eij...n = nkln p••...k...•
and hence the marginal Gibbs distribution: p••...k...•= e
Eij...n
nk .
iii) for independent identically distributed variable (non-interacting), we have Gn = 0, and hence:
Hn(X1,...,X n; PN) = U(X1,...,X n; PN) = nH(Xi) (32)
iv) considering the variables to be the 6 n variables of the phase space, with one variable of position and one
variable of momentum per body (noted ( X1
k,X2
k,X3
k,P1

the semi-classical formalism according to which the entropy formulation is (Landau and Lifshitz [76],p.22):
H6n(X1

1 ,P1
1 ,P2
1 ,P3
1 ,...,P 3
n; PN) = log
(∆X∆P
(2πℏ)6n
)
(33)
It is achieved by identifying the internal and free energy as following:
⟨E⟩= −6nlog(2πℏ) (34)
G= −log(∆X∆P) (35)
This identiﬁes the elementary volumes/probabilities with the Planck constant, the quantum of action (the con-
sistency in the units is realized in section 3.4.3 by the introduction of time). The quantum of action can be
illustrated by considering in the Figure 2 that it is the surface of the square/rectangle for two conjugate variables
(considered as position and momentum). In this setting, ∆ X∆P quantiﬁes the non-extensivity of the volume in
the phase-space due to interactions, or in other words, the mutual-informations account for the consideration of
the dependence of the subsystems considered as opened and exchanging energy. As noted by Baez and Pollard,
the relative entropy provides a quantitative measure of how far from equilibrium the whole system is [10]. The
basic principle of such expression of information theory in physics is known at least since Jaynes’s work [62, 64].
As a conclusion, information topology applies, without imposing metric or symplectic or contact structures,
to physical formalism of n-body interacting systems relying on empirical measures. Considering the 3 n or 6n
dimensions (degrees of freedom) of a conﬁguration or a phase space as random variables, it is possible to recover
12
the (semi) classical statistical physics formalism. It is also interesting to discuss the status of the analog of
the temperature variable in the present formalism which is played by the graining, which is the size Ni of the
alphabet of a variable Xi. In usual thermodynamic we have H(Xn; PN) = T.S(Xn), and to stay consistent,
temperature shall be a functional inverse of the graining N, lowest temperature being the ﬁnest grain (large N),
highest temperature being the coarsest graining (small N).
3.3 k-Entropy and k-Information landscapes
Information landscapes (deﬁnition):
The information landscapes are a representation of the (semi)-lattice of information structures where each element
is represented as a function of its corresponding value of entropy or mutual information. In abscissa are the
dimensions k and in ordinate the values of information functions of a given subset of k variables.
In data science terms, these landscapes provide a visualization of the potentially high-dimensional structure

of the data points. In information theory terms, it provides a representation of Shannon’s work on lattice [116]
further developed by Han [56]. Hk and Ik, as real continuous functions, provide a ranking of the lattices at
each dimension k. It is the ranking, i.e. the relative values of information, which matters and comes out of the
homological approach, rather than the absolute values. The principle of Hk and Ik landscapes is illustrated in
Figure 3 for n = 4. Hk and Ik analyse quantify the variability-randomness and statistical dependences at all
dimensions k, respectively, from 1 to n, n being the total number of variables under study. The Hk landscape
represents the values of joint entropy for all k-tuples of variables as a function of the dimensions k, the number
of variables in the k-tuple, together with the associated edges-paths of the lattice (in grey). The Ik landscape
represents the values of mutual-information for all k-tuples of variables as a function of the dimension k, which
is the number of variables in the k-tuple. Figure 3 gives two theoretical extremal examples of such landscapes,
one for independent identically distributed variables (totally disordered) and one for fully dependent identically
distributed variables (totally ordered). The degeneracy of Hk and Ik values is given by the binomial coeﬃcient
(color code in Figure 3), hence allowing to derive the normal exact expression of the information landscapes
in the assymptotic inﬁnite dimensional limit ( n →∞) by application of Laplace-Lemoivre theorem. These are
theoretical extremal examples: Hk and Ik landscapes eﬀectively computed and estimated on biological data with
ﬁnite sample are shown in the paper [16, 17, 125], and in practice the ﬁnite sample size ( m) may impose some
bounds on the landscapes.
3.4 Information Paths and Minimum Free Energy Complex
In this section we establish that information landscapes and paths encode directly the basic equalities, inequalities
and functions of information theory and allow us to obtain the minimum free energy complex that we estimate
on data.

3.4.1 Information Paths (deﬁnition)
On the discrete simplicial information lattice ∆ k, we deﬁne a path of degree k as a sequence of edges of the
lattice that begins at the least element of the lattice (the identity-constant ”0”), travels along edges from vertex
to vertex of increasing dimension and ends at the greatest element of the lattice of dimensionk. Information paths
are deﬁned on both joint-entropy and meet-mutual information semi-lattices, and the usual joint-entropy and
mutual-information functions are deﬁned on each element of such paths. Entropy path and information path of
degree kare noted HPk and IPk, respectively, and the set of all information paths is noted HPk = {HPi}i∈1,...,k!
for the entropy paths, and IPk = {IPi}i∈1,...,k! for the mutual-information paths. We have the theorem:
Theorem 3.2. The two sets of all information paths HPk and IPk in the simplicial information structure ∆k
are both in bijection with the symmetric group Sk. Notably, there are k! information paths in ∆k.
Proof: by simple enumeration, an edge of dimension mconnects k−medges of dimension m+ 1, the number
of paths is hence ( k−0).(k−1)....(k−k+ 2).(k−k+ 1) = k!, hence the conclusion □.
A given path can be identiﬁed with a permutation or a total order by extracting the missing variable in
a previous node when increasing the dimension, for example the mutual-information path in ∆ 4: IPi = 0 →
(0,X2) →(0,X1,X2) →(X1,X2,X4) →(0,X1,X2,X3,X4) can be noted as the permutation σ:
( 0 1 2 3 4
0 2 1 4 3
)
or (01234)
σ
− →(02143) (36)
We note an information path with arrows, giving for the previous example IPi = (0 →X2 →X1 →X4 →X3).
These paths shall be seen as the automorphisms of {1,2.....k} = [ k] and the space of entropy and mutual
information paths can be endowed with the structure of two opposite symmetric groups Sk and Sopp
k . The
equivalence of the set of paths and symmetric group only holds for the subcase of simplicial structures, and the
information paths in the lattice of partition are obviously much richer. More precisely, the subset of simplicial
information paths in the lattice of partitions corresponds to the automorphisms of the lattice. It is known that the
ﬁnite symmetric group is the automorphism group of the ﬁnite partition lattice [23]. The geometrical realization
of information paths IPk and HPk consists in two dual permutohedron (see Postnikov [108]), and gives the
informational version of the work of Mat´ uˇ s on conditional probability and permutohedron [90].
3.4.2 Derivatives, inequalities and conditional mutual information negativity
Derivatives of information paths: In the information landscapes, the paths HPi and IPi are piecewise
linear functions IPi(k) with IPi(k) = Ik where Ik is the mutual-information of the k-tuple of variables pertaining
to the path IPi. We deﬁne the ﬁrst derivatives of the paths for both entropy and mutual information structures
as piecewise linear functions:
First derivative of entropy path: the ﬁrst derivative of an entropy pathHPi(k) is the conditional information
(X1,...,X k−1).H(Xk; P):
dHPi(k)
dk = H(X1,...,X k; P) −H(X1,...,X k−1; P) = (X1,...,X k−1).H(Xk; P) (37)
This derivative is illustrated in the graph of Figure 4a. It implements the chain rule of entropy Hk+1 −Hk =
(X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1).H(Xi) (equation 12), and in homology provides a diagram where conditional entropy is a
simplicial coface map ( X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1).H(Xi) = di : Xk →Xk+1, as a simplicial special case of Hochschild
coboundaries 2.3.
First derivative of mutual information path: the ﬁrst derivative of an information path IPi(k) is minus
the conditional information ( Xk).I(X1,...,X k−1; P):
dIPi(k)
dk = I(X1,...,X k; P) −I(X1,...,X k−1; P) = −Xk.I(X1,...,X k−1; P) (38)
This derivative is illustrated in the graph of Figure 4b. It implements the chain rule of mutual-information
Ik−1 −Ik = Xk.Ik−1 (equation 13), and in homology provides a diagram where minus the conditional mutual-
information is a simplicial coface map Xi.I(X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1) = di : Xk →Xk+1, introduced in section
2.3.
Bounds of the derivatives and information inequalities The slope of entropy paths is bounded by
the usual conditional entropy bounds ([147] p.27-28). Its minimum is 0 and is achieved in the case where
Xk+1 is a deterministic function of ( X1,...,X k) (lower dashed red line in Figure 4a). Its global upperbound is
max Hk+1 = k.ln(N1...Nk+1) and its sharp bound given by ( X1; ...; ˆXi; ...; Xk+1).H(Xi) ≤H(Xi) is achieved in
the case whereXk+1 is independent ofX1,...,X k (we haveHk+1 = Hk+H(Xk+1) (higher dashed red line in Figure
14
Figure 4: Entropy and information paths. Illustration of an entropy path HPi = 0 →1 →4 →2 →3 (a)
and of a mutual information path IPi = 0 →1 →4 →3 →2 (b) for n= 4 random variables (see text).
4a). Hence, any entropy path lies in the (convex) entropy cone deﬁned by the 3 points labeled Hk, min Hk+1
and max Hk+1: the 3 vertices of the cone depicted as a red surface in Figure 4a and called the Shannonian Cone
following Yeung’s seminal work [148]. The behavior of a mutual-information path and the bounds of its slope
are richer and more complex than the preceding conditional entropy:
• For k= 2, the conditional information is the conditional entropy Xi.I(Xj) = Xi.H(Xj) and has the same
usual bounds 0 ≤Xi.I(Xj) ≤I(Xj).
• For k= 3 the conditional mutual-information Xi.I(Xj; Xh) is always positive or null Xi.I(Xj; Xh) ≥0 and
hence I2 ≥I3 ([147] p.26, the opposite of th.2.40 p.30), whereas the higher limit is given by Xi.I(Xj; Xh) ≥
min (Xi.H(Xj),Xi.H(Xh)) ([89] th.2.17), with equality iﬀ Xj and Xh are conditionally independent given
Xi, and implying that the slope from k= 2 to k= 3 increases in the Ik landscape.
• For k >3, Xk.I(X1; ..; Xk−1) can be negative as a consequence of the preceding inequalities. In terms of
information landscape this negativity means that the slope is positive, hence that the information path has
crossed a critical point, a minimum. As expressed by theorem 2.2, Xk.I(X1; ..; Xk−1) < 0 iﬀ Ik < Ik+1.
The minima correspond to zeros of conditional information (conditional independence) and hence detect
cocycles in the data. The results on information inequalities deﬁne as ”Shannonian” [145, 149, 91] the
set of inequalities that are obtained from conditional information positivity ( Xi.I(Xj; Xh) ≥0) by linear
combination, which forms a convex ”positive” cone after closure. ”Non-Shannonian” inequalities could
also be exhibited [145][149], hence deﬁning a new convex cone that includes and is strictly larger than
the Shannonian set. Following Yeung’s nomenclature and to underline the relation with his work, we call
the positive conditional mutual-information cone (surface colored in red in Figure 4b) the ”Shannonian”
cone and the negative conditional mutual-information cone (surface colored in blue in ﬁgure 4b) the ”non-
Shannonian” cone.
3.4.3 Information paths are random processes: topological 2nd law of thermodynamic and en-
tropy rate
Here we present the dynamical aspects of information structures. Information paths provide directly the standard
deﬁnition of a stochastic process and it imposes how the time arrow appears in the homological framework, how
time series can be analyzed, how entropy rates can be deﬁned (etc.).
Random (stochastic) process (deﬁnition [124]): A random process {Xt,t ∈T}is a collection of random
variables on the same probability space (Ω ,B,P) and the index set T is a totally ordered set.
A stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time, the probabilistic version of a time series.
Considering each symbol of a time series as a random variable, the deﬁnition of a random-stochastic process
corresponds to the unique information paths HPi and IPi which total order is the time order of the series. We
have the following lemma:
Lemma 1. (Stochastic process and information paths): Let (Ω,∆k,P) be a simplicial information structure,
then the set of entropy paths HPk and of mutual-information paths IPk are in one to one correspondence with
the set of stochastic processes {Xt,t ∈T,|T|= k}.
Proof: direct from the deﬁnitions □.
As we previously stated, these paths are also automorphisms of {1,2.....k}= [k]. We obtain immediately the
topological version of the second law of thermodynamic, which improves the result of Cover [35]:
Theorem 3.3. (Stochastic process and information paths): Let (Ω,∆k,P) be a simplicial information structure,
then the entropy of a stochastic process can only increase with time.
15
Proof: given the correspondence we just established, the statement is equivalent toH(X1,...,X k) ≥H(X1,...,X k−1),
which is a direct consequence of conditional entropy positivity and the chain rule of information withk= −1/ln 2.
The generalization with respect to the stationary Markov condition used by Cover comes from the remark that
in any case the indexing set of the variable is a total order. Note that the homological formalism imposes an
”initial” minimally low entropy state H(0) = I(0) = 0 (a usual assumption in physics), the constant and zero
degree homology, which has to have at least 1 component to talk about the cohomology □.
Remark: the meaning of this theorem in common terms was summarized by Gabor and Brillouin: ”you can’t
have something for nothing, not even an observation” [26]. This increase in entropy is illustrated in Figure a.
The usual stochastic approach of time series assumes a Markov chain structure, imposing peculiar statistical de-
pendences that restrict memory eﬀects (cf. the informational characterization of Markov chains in the associated
paper [16]). The consideration of stochastic processes without restriction allows any kind of dependences and ar-
bitrary long historical and ”non trivial” memory. From the biological point of view it formalizes the phenomenon
of arbitrary long-lasting memory. From the physical point of view, without proof, such a framework appears as
a classical analog of the consistent or decoherent histories developed notably by Griﬃths [55], Omnes [103], and
Gell-Mann and Hartle [50]. The information structures impose a stronger constraint of a totally ordered set (or
more generally a weak ordering) than the preorder imposed by Lieb and Yngvason [79] to derive the second law.
It is also interesting to note that even in this classical probability framework, the entropy cone (the topological
cone depicted in Figure 4a) imposed by information inequalities, when considered with this time ordering, is
a time-like cone (much-like the special relativity cone), but with the arguably remarkable fact that we did not
introduce any metric.
The stochastic process deﬁnition allows to deﬁne the ﬁnite and asymptotic information rate: the ﬁnite informa-
tion rate r of an information path HPi is r = Hk
k . The asymptotic information rate r of an information path
HPi is r= limk→∞
Hk
k . It requires the generalization of the present formalism to the inﬁnite dimensional setting
or inﬁnite information structures, which is not trivial and will be investigated in further work.
3.4.4 Local minima and critical dimension
The derivative of information paths allows to establish the lemma on which is based the information path analysis.
A critical point is said to be non-trivial if at this point the sign of the derivative of the path, i.e. the conditional
information, changes.
Lemma 2. (local minima of information paths):if Xk.I(X1; ..; Xk−1) < 0 then all paths from 0 to Ik
passing by Ik−1 have at least one local minimum. In order for an information path to have a non-trivial critical
point, it is necessary that k> 3, the smallest possible dimension of a critical point being k= 3.
Proof: it is a direct consequence of the deﬁnitions of paths and of conditional 2-mutual-information Xk.I2
positivity (Xk.I2 ≥0, cf. theorem 3.4.2) □.
Note that by deﬁnition a local minimum can be a global minimum. We will call, if it exists, the dimensionkof
the ﬁrst local minimum of an information path the ﬁrst informational critical dimension of the information
path IPi, and note it ki1 . This allows us to deﬁne maximal information paths:
Positive information path (deﬁnition): A positive information path is an information path from 0 to a given
Ik corresponding to a given k-tuple of variables such that Ik <Ik−1 <...<I 1.
Maximal Positive information path (deﬁnition): A maximal positive information path is a positive infor-
mation path of maximal length. More formally, a maximal positive information path is a positive information
path that is not a proper subset of positive information paths.
The deﬁnitions make coincide positive information paths and maximal positive information path with chains
(faces) and maximal chains (facets), respectively. The maximal positive information path stops at the ﬁrst local
minimum of an information path, if it exists. The ﬁrst informational critical dimension ki1 of a time series IPi,
whenever it exists, gives a quantiﬁcation of the duration of the memory of the system.
3.4.5 Sum over paths and mean information path
As previously, for k= 1, IPi(1) can be identiﬁed with the self-internal energy and for k≥2, IPi(k) corresponds
to the k-free-energy of a single path IPi. The chain rule of mutual information (equation 15) and the derivative
of an IPi path (equation 37) implies that the k-free-energy can be obtained from a single path:
Ik = I(X1; ...; Xk; P) = I(X1) −
k∑
i=2
Xi.I(X1; ...; Xi−1) = IPi(1) +
k∑
j=2
dIPi(j)
dj (39)
16
Hence, the global thermodynamical relation 25 can be understood as the sum over all paths, the sum over
informational histories: the classical, discrete and informational version of the path integrals in statistical physics
[46]. Indeed considering an inverse relation between time and dimension t= 1
n in the probability expression 3.2.1
for iid processes gives the usual expression of a unitary evolution operator p••...k...•= e
t.Eij...n
k . Free-information-
energy integrates over the simplicial structure of the whole lattice of partitions over degrees k≥2, which further
justiﬁes its free energy name.
In order to obtain a single state function instead of a group of k! paths-functions, we can compute the mean
behavior of the information structure, which is achieved by deﬁning the mean Hk and Ik, noted ⟨Hk⟩and ⟨Ik⟩:
⟨Hk⟩=
∑
T⊂[n];card(T)=kHk(XT; P)(n
k
) (40)
and
⟨Ik⟩=
∑
T⊂[n];card(T)=kIk(XT; P)(n
k
) (41)
For example, considering n= 3, then ⟨I2⟩= I(X1;X2)+I(X1;X3)+I(X2;X3)
3 . This deﬁnes the mean mutual informa-
tion path and a mean entropy path noted ⟨HP⟩(k) and ⟨IP⟩(k) in the information landscape. The case k= 2 of
those functions introduced in [17], is studied in Merkh and Mont´ ufar [94] with a characterization of the degen-
eracy of their maxima and are called Factorized Mutual-Information. As previously, ⟨IP⟩(1) can be identiﬁed
with the mean self-internal energy U(Xn
hom; PN) and for k >1 ⟨IP⟩(k) to the mean k-free-information-energy
G(Xn
hom; PN), giving the usual isotherm relation:
H(Xn
hom; PN) = U(Xn
hom; PN) −G(Xn
hom; PN) (42)
Figure 5: Example of mean entropy and information paths of gene expression. a, Mean entropy path
⟨Hk⟩for the 21 genes of interest for population A (green line) and population B neurons (red line). b, Mean
information path ⟨Ik⟩for the same pool of genes. c, Mean information path ⟨Ik⟩for the rest of 20 genes (”non
relevant”). The undersampling dimension introduced in the associated paper [16] is depicted with arrows.
The computation of the mean paths corresponds to an idealized information structure Xn
hom for which all
the variables would be identically distributed, would have the same entropy, and would share the same mutual
information Ik at each dimension k: a homogeneous information structure, with homogeneous high-dimension
k-body interactions. Like usually achieved in physics notably in mean-ﬁeld theory (for example Weiss [140] or
Hartree), it aims to provide a single function summarizing the average behavior of the system (we will see that
in practice it misses the important biological structures, pointing out the constitutive heterogeneity of biological
systems see 4.1). Using the same dataset and results presented in [16, 17, 125], the ⟨IP⟩(k) paths estimated
on genetic expression data set are shown for two population A and population B of neurons in Figure 5. We
quantiﬁed the gene expression levels for 41 genes in two populations of cells (A or B) as presented in [16, 17, 125].
We estimated Hk and Ik landscapes for these two populations and for two sets of genes (”genes of interest” and
”non relevant”) according to the computational and estimation methods presented in [16, 17, 125]. The available
computational power restricts the analysis to a maximum of n= 21 variables (or 21 dimensions), and imposed
us to divide the genes between the two classes ”genes of interest” and ”non relevant”. The 21 genes of interest
were selected within the 41 quantiﬁed genes according to their known speciﬁc involvement in the function of
population A cells.
Figure 5 exhibits the critical phenomenon usually encountered in condensed matter physics, like the example of
Van-der-Walls interactions [106]. Like any Ik path, ⟨IP⟩(k) can have a ﬁrst minimum with a critical dimension
ki1 that could be called the homogeneous critical dimension. For the 21 genes of interest (whose expression
levels, given the literature, are expected to be linked in these cell types) the ⟨Ik⟩path exhibits a clear minimum
at the critical dimension ki1 = 4 for population A neurons and ki1 = 5 population B neurons, reproducing the
usual free-energy potential in the condensed phase for which n-body interactions are non-negligible. For the 20
17
other genes, less expected to be related in these cell types, the ⟨Ik⟩path exhibits a monotonic decrease without a
non-trivial minimum, which corresponds to the usual free-energy potential in the uncondensed-disordered phase
for which the n-body interactions are negligible. Indeed, as shown in the work of Xie and colleagues [144], the
tensor network renormalization approach of n-body interacting quantum systems gives rise to an expression of
the free-energy as a function of the dimension of the interactions, in the same way than achieved here.
3.4.6 Minimum free energy complex
The analysis of information paths that we now propose aims to determine all the ﬁrst critical points of infor-
mation paths, in other words to determine all the information paths for which conditional information stays
positive, and all ﬁrst local minima of the information landscape, that can also be interpreted as a conditional
independence criterion. Such an exhaustive characterization would give a good description of the landscape and
of the complexity of the measured system. The qualitative reason for considering only the ﬁrst extrema for the
data analysis is that, beyond that point, mutual information diverges (as section 3.4.4 explains) and the maximal
positive information paths correspond to stable functional modules in the application to data (gene expression).
A more mathematical justiﬁcation is that they deﬁne the facets of a complex in our simplicial structure, which
we will call the minimum energy complex of our information structure, underlining that this complex is the
formalization of the minimum free energy principle in a degenerate case.
We now obtain the theorem that our information path analysis aims to characterize empirically:
Theorem 3.4. (Minimum free energy complex):the set of all maximal positive information paths forms
a simplicial complex that we call the minimum free energy complex. Moreover, the dimension-degree of the
minimum free energy complex is the maximum of all the ﬁrst informational critical dimensions ( d = max ki1 ),
if it exists, or the dimension of the whole simplicial structure n. The minimum free energy complex is noted
X+d. A necessary condition for this complex not to be a simplex is that its dimension is greater or equal to four
(d≥4).
Proof: It is known that there is a one to one correspondence between simplicial complexes and their set of
maximal chains (facets) (see [123] p.95 for example). The last part follows from Lemma 1. □.
In simple words, the maximal faces, e.g. the maximal positive information paths, encode all the structures of
the minimum free energy complex. Figure 6 illustrates one of the simplest examples of a minimum free energy
complex that is not a simplex, of dimension four in a ﬁve-dimensional simplicial structure of information ∆ 5.
Figure 6: Example of maximal Ik paths in an Ik landscape for n= 5 together with its corresponding
minimum free information energy complex. a, maximal Ik paths in an Ik landscape for n = 5. The
maximum positive information paths are depicted in red, for example the paths 1 →2 →3 →4 but also
4 →3 →2 →1, 3 →4 →5, and 1 →2 →5 are maximum positive information paths, that is facets/maximal
chains. The facet 1 →2 →3 →4 is a 3-simplex while 3 →4 →5 is a 2-simplex with critical dimension
k3→4→5 = 3. The usual dimension of the simplex is used here, but we could have augmented it by one, since
we added the constant element ”0” to the algebra (pointed space), such that the usual simplicial dimension
and the critical dimension correspond. The maximal critical dimension of the positive information paths is
the dimension of the complex and hence d(X+k) = d(1 →2 →3 →4) = 4. b, The minimum free energy
complex corresponding to the preceding maximal ik paths. It is a subcomplex of the 4-simplex also called
the 5-cell with only one 4 dimensional cell among the ﬁve depicted as the bottom tetrahedron {1234}with
darker red volume. It has 5 vertices, 10 edges, 10 2-faces and one 3-face (cell), hence its Euler characteristic
is χ(X+k) = 5 −10 + 10 −1 = 4 and its minimum free energy characteristic characteristic is: H+k(X+k) =∑5
Xi∈X+k I(Xi) −∑10
(Xi;Xj)∈X+k I(Xi; Xj) + ∑10
(Xi;Xj;Xh)∈X+k I(Xi; Xj; Xh) −I(X1; X2; X3; X4)
18
We deﬁne the minimum free energy characteristic as:
H+k(X+k; P) =
k∑
i=1
(−1)i−1 ∑
I⊂X+;card(I)=i
Ii(XI; P) (43)
, where the component with dimension higher than one is a free energy. In the example of Figure 6 it gives:
H+k(X+k) =
5∑
Xi∈X+k
I(Xi) −
10∑
(Xi;Xj)∈X+k
I(Xi; Xj)
+
10∑
(Xi;Xj;Xh)∈X+k
I(Xi; Xj; Xh) −I(X1; X2; X3; X4)
(44)
We propose that this complex deﬁnes a complex system:
Complex system (deﬁnition): A complex system is a minimum free energy complex.
It has the merit to provide a formal deﬁnition of complex systems as simple as the deﬁnition of an abstract
simplicial complex can be, and to be quite consensual with respect to some of the approaches in this domain,
as reviewed by Newman [98]. Notably, it provides a formal basis to deﬁne some of the important concepts in
complex systems: emergence being the coboundary map, imergence the boundary map, synergy being information
negativity, organization scales being the ranks of random-variable lattices, a collective interaction being a local
minimum of free-energy, diversity being the multiplicity of these minima quantiﬁed by the number of facets, a
network being a 1-complex, a network of network being a 1-complex in hyper-cohomology.
The interpretation in terms of sum over paths in the complex is direct as it sums over paths until conditional
independence. We called it the minimum free energy complex but could have called it instead the positive or
instantaneous complex because its facets appear as the boundaries of the ”present” structure, but it obviously
contains all the past-history and the memory of the structure (notably encoded in the negative Ik that are
necessarily non-Markovian). The topological formalization of the minimum energy allows the coexistence of
numerous local minima, a situation usually encountered in complex systems (slow aging) such as frustrated
glasses and K-sat problems [95, 96] which settings correspond here to the case of n binary random variables,
N1 = ... = N2 = 2. The existence of the frustration eﬀect, due to the multiplicity of these local minima in the
free energy landscape [132], has also been one of the main diﬃculties of the condensed matter theory. Matsuda
could show that Ik negativity is a signature of frustration [89]. The ﬁrst axioms of DFT consider that probability
densities of n′elementary bodies are each in a 3-dimensional space [58, 70], deﬁning a whole simplicial structure
of dimension n = 3n′, commonly called the conﬁguration space. When considered with the physical axiom of
a conﬁguration space, the theorem 3.4 implies that, while the minimum free information energy complex of an
elementary body can only be a simplex, the conﬁguration space of n′elementary bodies can be a complex with
(quite) arbitrary topology. In simple terms, this settles the elementary components of the conﬁguration space
as 3-simplices, which composition can give arbitrarily complicated k-complexes. This idea is in resonance with
the triangulations of space-time that arose notably from the work of Wheeler [141] and Penrose [107], like spin
foams [113] and causal sets [118], while we only considered here classical probabilities.
4 Discussion
4.1 Complexity through ﬁnite dimension non-extensivity and non iid
Statistical physics without statistical limit? The measure of entropy and information rate on data (the
evolution of entropy Hk when the number of variables k increases) has a long history. Originally, in the work
of Strong and colleagues [120], and as usual in information theory and statistical physics, it was considered that
the ”true” entropy was given in the asymptotic limit limn→∞Hn under stationarity or stronger assumptions. As
explained in section 2.1 (see also the note of Kontsevitch [72], in the work of Baez, Fritz and Leinster [9]), and
extensively in the statistical physic works of Niven [101, 100, 99], entropy does not need asymptotic or inﬁnite
assumptions such as Stirling approximation to be derived. Here and in the associated paper [16], we tried to
understand, explore, and exploit this observation. Rather than being interested in the asymptotic limit (the
inﬁnite dimensional case) and absolute values of information, the present analysis focuses on the ﬁnite version of
the ”slow approach of the entropy to its extensive asymptotic limit” that Grassberger [54], and then Bialek, Ne-
menman and Tishby proposed to be ”a sign of complexity” [22], ”complexity through non-extensivity” (see also
Tsallis [131]). In short, we consider the non-extensivity of information before considering its asymptotic limit.
Considering a statistical physics without statistical limit could be pertinent for the study of ”small” systems,
which concerns biological systems. Their small size allows them to harness thermal ﬂuctuations, and impose
their investigation with out-of equilibrium methods, as exposed in the work of Ritort and colleagues, reviewed
19
in [112]. The Hk and Ik landscapes presented here give a detailed expression of the ”signs of complexity” and
non-extensivity, for such small size systems (ﬁnite dimension k), and give a ﬁnite dimensional geometric view of
the ”slow approach of the entropy to its extensive asymptotic limit”. In a sense, what replaces here the large
number limits, Avogadro number consideration (etc.), is the combinatorial explosions of the diﬀerent possible
interactions: in the same way as in Van Der Walls paradigm, a combinatorial number of weak interactions can
lead to a strong global interaction. In practice, like for any empirical investigation, the ﬁnite dimensional case
imposes restrictions on the conclusions, and basically reminds us that we have not measured everything. Some
relevant random variables for the observed system may be absent from the analysis, and adding such variables
could reveal new interactions that are eﬀectively constitutive and relevant to the system. Among all possible
structures of data, one is universal: data and empirical measures are discrete and ﬁnite, as emphasized by Born
[24], and fully justify the cohomological approach used here originating in topos (designed by Grothendieck to
hold the discrete and continuous in a single hand), which was originally constructed to handle in a common
framework the Lie and Galois theory, continuous and discrete symmetries.
Naive estimations let the data speaks, lack of iid or mean-ﬁeld assumptions let diﬀerentiate the
objects One of the striking results of the data analysis as presented here and in the associated paper [16]
concerns the relatively low sample size ( m = 41 and m = 111 for the analysis with cells as variable and with
genes as variables respectively) required to obtain satisfying results in relatively high dimensions ( k = 10 and
k = 6 respectively). Satisfying results means here that they predict already known results reported in the
biological literature, or in agreement with experts labels. In [87], Nemenman and colleagues, who developed the
problematic of the sampling problem, state in the introduction ”entropy may be estimated reliably even when
inferences about details of the underlying probability distribution are impossible. Thus the direct estimation
of dependencies has a chance even for undersampled problems” and conclude that ”a major advantage of our
deﬁnition of statistical dependencies in terms of the MaxEnt approximations is that it can be applied even when
the underlying distributions are undersampled”. The present analysis agrees and conﬁrms their conclusion. The
method applied here is quite elementary. It does not make assumptions of an expected or true distribution, of
maximum entropy distribution or pairwise interaction Hamiltonian, coupling constant or metric, of stationarity
or ergodicity or iid process, Markov chain, or underlying network structure (...) or whatever prior that would
speak in place of the data. It just considers numerical empirical probabilities as expressed by Kolmogorov axioms
([71] chap.1), which he called the ”generalized ﬁelds of probability” because it does not assume the 6th axiom
of continuity. Rather than ﬁxing a model with priors, the present formalism allows the raw data to impose
freely their speciﬁc structure to the model, what is usually called the naive approach or naive estimation. If
one accepts that a frequentist theory and interpretation of probability is mathematically valid ([71], chap.1),
one may then conclude that a frequentist theory of entropy and information may also hold, and moreover
directly fulﬁlls the usual requirement of observability in theoretical physics recalled by Born in his Nobel lecture
[24]. This frequentist elementary consideration is not trivial mathematically notably when considered from the
number theoretic point of view. For example, the combinatoric of integer partitions of m could be investigated
in the general information structure (partition) context, which up to our knowledge has not been achieved in
the context of probability and information. Up to our knowledge, all previous studies that tried to quantify
statistical dependences by information methods (with more than 3 variables) used total correlation [129, 87], and
crucially assumed that the interaction between the variables are homogeneous which corresponds to usual mean
ﬁeld assumption, and to the iid case of mean information 3.4.5 presented here. The combinatorial decomposition
proposed allows to identify heterogeneous classes within the set of variables which would not have been possible
using homogeneous assumptions. We hence believe that such combinatorial approach will play a key role in
future machine learning developments and automatic classiﬁcation problems. Notably, we only explored here
the smallest and simplest combinatorics arising in homology, and Vigneaux already identiﬁed q-multinomial
extensions of this combinatorics associated with Tsallis entropies [134]. Notably, as stressed in introduction,
those combinatorial decomposition can be understood as providing a geometrically constrained architecture to
neural networks generalization.
4.2 Epigenetic topological learning - biological diversity
In place of the MaxEnt principle, we proposed an almost synonymous least energy principle equivalent here
to a homological complex (ﬁnite and without metric assumptions). Mathematically, we took proﬁt of the fact
that whether the maximum of entropy functional is always unique and in a sense normative, the minima of Ik
functionals exhibit a rich structure of degeneracy, generated by the ”non-Shannonian set” [145, 149, 91] and
conjectured to be at least as rich as topological links can be. We proposed that this multiplicity of minima
accounts for biological diversity, or more precisely that the number of facets of this complex quantiﬁes the
diversity in the system. The application to cell type identiﬁcation presented in the associated paper [16] gives
a preliminary validation of such quantiﬁcation. Moreover, the deﬁnition of a complex system as the minimum
20
free-energy complex given in section 3.4.6, underlining that diversity is just the multiplicity of the minima, is
in agreement with Waddington’s original work [137] (see Figure 7b). In the allegory of Waddington’s epigenetic
landscapes, whatever the ball, it will always fall down, a statement that can be assimilated to the second law
of thermodynamic. But doing so, it will be able to take diﬀerent paths: diversity comes from the multiple
minima. The explanation by Waddington of such landscape is a ”complex system of interactions” that can be
formalized by the minimum free energy complex with interactions corresponding to the Ik. Moreover, formalisms
assuming that the variables are identically distributed, as for the homogeneous systems described in the section
on mean paths 3.4.5, will display a single ﬁrst minima (one facet, a simplex), and hence no diversity. Sharing
the same aims, Teschendorﬀ and Enver, and then Jin and colleagues, proposed an alternative interpretation of
Waddington’s landscape in terms of signaling entropy [127] and of probability transitions [65], respectively.
Figure 7: The epigenetic landscape of Waddington. a, The epigenetic landscape of Waddington, a path of
the ball in this landscape illustrates a cell developmental fate. b, ”The complex system of interactions underlying
the epigenetic landscape” with Waddington’s original legends [137].
Following Thom’s topological morphogenetic view of Waddington’s work [128], we propose that Ik landscape,
paths and minimum free energy complex provide a possible informational formalization of Waddington’s epige-
netic complex landscape and cell fates (cf. Figure 7). This formalization of Waddington’s epigenetic view is
consistent with the machine learning formalization of Hebbian epigenetic plasticity. From the pure formal view,
the models of Hebbian neural learning like Hopﬁeld’s network, Boltzmann machines, the Infomax models pro-
posed by Linsker, Nadal and Parga, Bell and Sejnowski [80, 97, 19]) can be viewed as binary variables subcases
of a generic N-ary variable epigenetic developmental process. For example, Potts model were implemented for
the simulation of cell-based morphogenesis by Glazier and colleagues [31]. Hence the topological approach can
allow the treatment of neural learning and development on the ground of a common epigenetic formalism, in
agreement with biological results pointing out the continuum and ”entanglement” of the biological processes un-
derlying development and learning [49]. In terms of the current problematics of neuroscience, such generalization
allows on a formal level to consider an analog coding in place of a digital coding, and the methods developed
here can be applied to studies investigating (discrete) analog coding.
Moreover, following all the work of these last decades on the application of statistical physics to biological systems
(some of them cited in this article), we propose that the epigenetic process implements the ﬁrst two laws of ther-
modynamics, which weak topological versions are proposed to hold in the raw data space (without phase space or
symplectic structure, cf. section 3.4.3). As previously underlined, the condition for such an inscription of living
organism dynamic into classical statistical physics to be legitimate is that the considered variables correspond to
phase space variables.
