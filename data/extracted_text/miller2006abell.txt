ABSTRACT
Wepresentanin-depthanalysis oftheButcher-Oemler clusterA2111, includingnew
optical spectroscopy plus a deep Very Large Array (VLA) radio continuum observation.
These are combined with optical imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
to assess the activity and properties of member galaxies. Prior X-ray studies have sug-
gested A2111 is a head-on cluster merger, a dynamical state which might be connected
to the high level of activity inferred from its blue fraction. We are able to directly
assess this claim, using our spectroscopic data to identify 95 cluster members among
196 total galaxy spectra. These galaxy velocities do not themselves provide significant
evidence for the merger interpretation, however they are consistent with it provided the
system is viewed near the time of core passage and at a viewing angle &30◦ different
from the merger axis. The SDSS data allow us to confirm the high blue fraction for
A2111, f =0.15±0.03 based on photometry alone and f =0.23±0.03 using spectro-
b b
scopic data to remove background galaxies. We are able to detect 175 optical sources
from the SDSS in our VLA radio data, of which 35 have redshift information. We use
the SDSS photometry to determine photometric redshifts for the remaining 140 radio-
optical sources. In total we identify up to 26 cluster radio galaxies, 14 of which have
spectroscopic redshifts. The optical spectroscopy and radio data reveal a substantial
populationof dustystarburstswithinthecluster. Thehighbluefraction andprevalence
of star formation is consistent with the hypothesis that dynamically-active clusters are
associated with more active member galaxies than relaxed clusters.

1. Introduction
ThediscoveryoftheButcher-Oemlereffect(Butcher&Oemler1984,hereafterBO84)hasledto
an unusualbias in the study of galaxy evolution in clusters. As the Butcher-Oemler effect indicates
galaxy clusters were more active at earlier epochs, there has been great interest in the study of
clusters at higher and higher redshift. This interest has also been fueled by better observational
capabilities, which have increasingly made it possible to obtain high quality data at fainter limits.
These same factors have sparked continued interest in low redshift clusters of galaxies; well-studied
low redshift clusters are the necessary benchmark for comparison with higher redshiftsamples, and
provide the best opportunity to probe deep into luminosity functions. The result of these trends is
that many intermediate redshift clusters (z ∼ 0.2) have been largely overlooked.
Abell 2111, at z = 0.23, has the distinction of being the richest cluster in the original BO84
study with N = 155 (i.e., 30% of the cluster’s total projected galaxies amounts to 155 galaxies).
30
For reference, the next richest cluster in that study, A520, had N = 126 and the 3C295 cluster
30
which inspired the original research had only N = 45. A2111 also was among the higher blue
30
fraction clusters noted in BO84 at f = 0.16±0.03. The primary concern with the interpretation
b
of the BO84 results was that of contamination, prompting subsequent campaigns to obtain optical
spectroscopy and confirm whether the blue galaxies were truly cluster members or simply galaxies
viewed in projection on the clusters. Consequently, spectroscopy results for 24 galaxies in the
direction of A2111 were presented by Lavery & Henry (1986). These included 14 cluster members
and confirmed the high blue fraction determined photometrically by BO84. The same authors
further investigated the Butcher-Oemler effect using their A2111 data along with several other
clusters, and found evidence that the blue galaxies often had nearby companions indicative of
galaxy-galaxy mergers (Lavery & Henry 1988) and that their morphologies frequently included
disks (Lavery & Henry 1994). However, outside of these papers and the presentation of galaxy
morphologies within the very core of the cluster (Fasano et al. 2000), there has been little optical
study of A2111.
In addition to its richness and high blue fraction, X-ray studies of A2111 reveal an interesting
cluster. Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997) presented ROSAT observations of A2111 in conjunction
withopticalimaginginR-band. TheX-raydatarevealed acomplexmorphologyfortheintracluster
gas, includingelongated emission whosedegree of elongation changes withintensity. Thecluster X-
ray emission was further decomposed into a main component with a superimposed subcomponent.
The subcomponent consisted of a main central blob located between the two bright galaxies at
the cluster center, a diffuse twisted tail to the northwest, and a lobe to the southeast. This was

interpretedasevidenceforA2111representingahead-onmerger. Thesubclusterwouldhaveentered
from the northwest, leaving the diffuse tail. Its core, the central blob of emission, would be heated
as it plowed through the center of the main cluster component. The ROSAT data did indicate a
higher temperature for the blob, which was later confirmed by ASCA (Henriksen, Wang, & Ulmer
1999). Related studies have argued that cluster mergers evidenced by the elliptical appearance
of their X-ray emitting intracluster gas are intimately related to galaxy evolution and high blue
fractions (Wang & Ulmer 1997; Metevier, Romer, & Ulmer 2000).
Recent investigations of the radio galaxy populations of clusters have also yielded tantalizing
evidence that cluster mergers may be associated with increased galaxy activity. The best-studied
example is A2125, a high blue fraction cluster at z = 0.25. In an initial study using the NRAO
Very Large Array (VLA), Dwarakanath & Owen (1999) and Owen et al. (1999) found a much
higher detection rate for A2125 galaxies relative to the comparable richness but low blue fraction
cluster A2645. The significance of the radio data is that radio emission from individual galaxies is
an excellent tracer of star formation and AGN activity (e.g., Condon 1992; Yun, Reddy, & Condon
2001). In the absence of an AGN, the radio continuum emission (typically at 1.4 GHz) is a nearly
directmeasureofthestarformationrate(SFR).TheprincipaldifferencebetweenA2125 andA2645

Further investigation of A2125, including optical spectroscopy of hundreds of galaxies (Miller et
al. 2004) and deeper, higher resolution radio observations and ancillary data (Owen et al. 2005)
supported the dynamical assessment and strengthened the association of the radio detections with
actively star-forming galaxies. Additional examples of dynamically-active clusters with increased
populations of radio galaxies are gradually being identified (A2255, A3562, A851; Miller & Owen
2003; Miller 2005; Morrison et al. 2005). In the case of A851, radio observations proved especially
fruitful as several galaxies with post-starburst optical spectra – and hence no optical evidence for
current star formation – appear to be heavily dust-enshrouded starbursts (Smail et al. 1999). The
activity of these galaxies was revealed through their detection at radio wavelengths.
In this paper, we present a detailed multiwavelength analysis of A2111. It includes much more
comprehensive optical spectroscopy than previously published, with over 200 collected spectra.
Thesedataenableusto presentadynamicalanalysis of thecluster inorder toassess thehypothesis
that A2111 is a cluster merger. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000) has
also recently covered A2111, thereby providing accurate multiband photometry of cluster galaxies.
With these data and our spectroscopy, we re-investigate the cluster blue fraction: is A2111 truly
a “blue” cluster, or is it significantly contaminated by foreground and background galaxies? What
do the spectra tell us about the cluster galaxies – is there evidence for current or recent starbursts,
potentially related tothecluster dynamicalstate? Finally, wepresentadeepVLAradiocontinuum
observation ofA2111. Theradiodataachieve anrmssensitivity of13µJy, therebydetecting cluster
galaxies with SFR as low as 5.5 M⊙ year−1 (using the relationship of Yun, Reddy, & Condon 2001,
which assumed a Salpeter IMF from 0.1 to 100 M⊙). In addition to study of the cluster itself,
the multiwavelength data are a useful dataset for understanding galaxy evolution from deep field
– 4 –
observations. Thus, all optical sources with associated radio detections are reported along with
useful information such as photometric redshifts (or spectroscopic redshifts when available).
Unless otherwise stated, we adopt the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmology with
H = 71 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ω = 0.27 and Ω = 0.73 (Spergel et al. 2003). This translates to
0 m Λ
1′′ equaling 3.6 kpc at A2111. The assumed cluster center position is 15h39m40s.9 +34◦25′04′′ (all
reported coordinates are J2000) taken from the X-ray analysis of Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997).
This lies between the two brightest optical galaxies, often associated with the cluster center. The
first of these, at 15h39m40s.5 +34◦25′27′′, has historically been used as the cluster center (e.g.,
Sandage, Kristian, & Westphal 1976). The second is located 47′′ away at 15h39m41s.8 +34◦24′43′′.
2. Data
2.1. Optical Spectroscopy
GalaxyspectrawithinthefieldofA2111wereobtainedusingtheHydramultifiberspectrograph
on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope during 1996. Several clusters were the targets of these observations,
and the reader is referred to Miller et al. (2004) for additional details on the data collection,
reduction, and analysis. Briefly, three fiber configurations were observed during 1996 May 20–22,
with a fourth observed on 1996 June 10–11 (this fourth configuration was obtained during queue
mode scheduling). Typically around 30 of the 96 available fibers were assigned to random locations
to produce a good quality sky spectrum for subtraction. The observations all used the blue fibers
(3′.′1)anda400linemm−1 gratingblazedat4000˚A,withtheresultingspectrahavingaresolutionof
7˚Aandspanningfromabout4300˚Ato7500˚A. Eachfiberconfigurationwasobservedmultipletimes
to facilitate cosmic ray rejection, with total exposure times ranging from 2 to 5 hours. Standard
calibration exposures were also obtained (bias frames, flat fields, fiber flats for tracing extraction
apertures,andCuArlampsforwavelength calibration), however, nofluxcalibration wasperformed.
Velocities were measured by cross correlation with velocity standards using the IRAF RV
package (Tonry & Davis 1979), and by Gaussian fitting of emission lines. For thecross correlations,
a set of 22 velocity standard templates were usedwith the adopted velocity representing a weighted
average of the results from theindividualtemplates (for details see Miller et al. 2004). Initial errors
in cross correlation velocities were based on the goodness of fit, R, such that δcz = 280(1+R)−1
km s−1 (Hill & Oegerle 1998). A velocity for an emission line object was simply determined as the
mean of the velocity implied by each of its fitted lines, shifted by the heliocentric correction. The
initial error for an emission line measured velocity was simply the dispersion of the individual line
fits divided by the square root of the number of fitted lines (i.e., the error in the mean). If a given
galaxy hadbothacrosscorrelation andanemissionlineredshift,weadoptedthemeasurementwith
the lower error. There were 20 such galaxies, and the velocities were found to be highly consistent
with the largest difference between a cross correlation and emission line redshift being 120 km s−1.
Finally, an additional error of 40 km s−1 was added in quadrature to the error for each measured
– 5 –
velocity. This value was determined based on repeated observations of velocity standards over the
course of the observations (see Miller et al. 2004).
The final velocities are presented in Table 1. In addition, we have used the NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database (NED) to identify galaxies with velocity measurements in the literature
and within 22.′5 of the center of A2111, with this radius chosen based on our radio data (see
Section 2.3). It corresponds to a linear diameter of 9.8 Mpc at the redshift of A2111. In total,
there were 13 galaxies in the A2111 field which had NED velocities, six of which are also found in
Table 1. Our velocities are on average about 100 km s−1 greater, with a large dispersion of nearly
700 km s−1. The NED velocities come from three prior works: Lavery & Henry (1994)1, Crawford
et al. (1999), and Morrison et al. (2003). The bulk of the discrepancy between our velocities and
thoseinNEDcanbeattributedtoafairlylargeoffsetfromtheLavery&Henry(1994)values,which
are fairly coarse estimates (they are presented in terms of redshift out to three decimal places, and
hence have an implied error of ∼ 300 km s−1). For the three galaxies in common with Lavery &
Henry, our velocities are on average about 600 km s−1 greater. Similarly, spectroscopy covering the
A2111 field has recently become available in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (DR4,
Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2005). There are 19 galaxy velocities in common with those in Table 1.
The mean difference in velocity between our measurements and the SDSS values is 15 km s−1 with
a dispersion of 56 km s−1, and hence an associated error in the mean of 13 km s−1. Thus, our
velocities are consistent with those of the SDSS. We also note this is a useful check on our derived
errors. The dispersion in the mean velocity difference between our values and those of the SDSS
represents the combined errors of the two measurements. The SDSS quotes an rms velocity error
of ∼30 km s−1, which would imply our velocity error is ∼45 km s−1. Indeed, this uncertainty is
typical of those velocities presented in Table 1.
2.2. Optical Imaging
High quality optical imaging of A2111 is available from theSDSSData Release 3 (DR3 Abaza-
jian et al. 2005). This provides imaging in five filters, u g r i z, with point source detection limits
in magnitudes ranging from 20.5 (z) to 22.2 (g and r) and photometric calibration good to about
2%. The full width half maximum of the PSF in r is typically around 1′.′4.
Photometric data for all objects within the A2111 field were obtained from the DR3. The
adopted magnitudes corresponded to the “best” magnitudes, which are determined usingthe latest
version of the SDSS reduction pipeline (the pipeline has been unchanged since the release of the
DR2 Abazajian et al. 2004). They are model magnitudes based on the AB magnitude system,
and correspond to the better of an exponential or DeVaucouleurs profile fit. In addition to this

catalog data, FITS images were obtained for visual inspection of possibleradio sources (see Section
2.3.2). We have also used an R image kindly provided by Glenn Morrison for visual confirmations
of sources in the inner regions of the surveyed area. This image was obtained using the KPNO
0.9m with the T2KA CCD, providing a 23′ by 23′ field of view. Details may be found in Morrison
et al. (2003).
2.3. Radio Continuum Imaging
2.3.1. Observations and Reductions
The radio data were collected using the VLA under program code AM759. A total of ten
hours of time were scheduled, consisting of a pair of five-hour tracks centered on the transit of
A2111 on 2003 June 4 and 2003 June 9. The VLA was in its largest configuration (A array),
producing 1′.′5 resolution images for the 1.4 GHz observations. The usual “4” mode was used for
the correlator, which results in seven 3.125 MHz channels at each of two IFs for both right and left
circular polarization. This allows for deep imaging by reducing the effects of bandwidth smearing
over the large primary beam area. An integration time of 10 seconds was used, which reduced the
size of the (u,v) data set at the expense of some time-average smearing. The pointing center was
15h39m41s +34◦25′04′′.
Calibration was achieved in AIPS via the standard procedures. The raw data were loaded
including antenna-specific weights, which account for differences in observed system temperature
among the 27 antennas. Flux calibration was based on observations of 3C286, and the source
1602+334wasobservedroughlyevery45minutesforthepurposeofphaseandbandpasscalibration.
It lies within 5◦ of A2111. Additional self-calibration of the (u,v) data was performed during the
imaging steps.
Imaging was performed using the AIPS task IMAGR. This included multiple facets to account
for sky curvature over the large primary beam size (the “3D effect”). The majority of the primary
beam, aradiusof 22.′5whichtranslates to abouttheradiuswheretheresponseis about20% of that
at the pointing center, was imaged in 37 facets each of 1024 × 1024 0′.′4 pixels. An additional 19
facets were devoted to bright sources at the very edges of the primary beam and in the sidelobes.
The overall procedure was incremental, with imaging followed by inspection of the images and
boxing of detected sources to be used as input to subsequent imaging runs. Self-calibration steps
were also included, initially just in phase and later in both amplitude and phase. The final images
had a 1′.′51 × 1′.′50 FWHM beam, with most facets having an rms noise of 13 µJy. The noise was
higher in the vicinity of a few bright sources, although only one of these was located within 2 Mpc
of the cluster center (J153912.0+342933). Near this source, the rms noise rises to 20 µJy.
A catalog of radio sources was then constructed from the 37 primary facets using the AIPS
task SAD. This catalog was meant to be fairly generous in detection of sources, and SAD extracted
– 7 –
sources for which the peak and integral fluxes were above 52 µJy (i.e., 4σ sources at the pointing
center). SADwasalsodirected tocreateresidualmapswhichwereinspectedtoidentify anysources
missed by the algorithm. These were added to the output catalog manually. All possible sources
were later subjected to more rigorous standards after correlating with the optical data, as detailed
in the next section.
2.3.2. Optical IDs for Radio Sources
The SDSS photometric database of all detected objects within the A2111 field was correlated
withthepreliminaryradiocatalog. Thesearch radiusforthiscorrelation was 1′.′5, as determinedby
examining the distribution of the separations of each optical source to its nearest radio source (see
Figure1). Thepresenceof realassociations means this distributionpeaks near aseparation of zero,
then declines rapidly. As the search radius increases, random associations become more likely and
the distribution increases steadily. The 1′.′5 search radius covers the real associations while limiting
the number of chance superpositions. Thenumber of chance superpositionsin the final list of radio
sources with corresponding optical detections was evaluated by determining the average density
of objects from the optical catalog around the positions of sources in the radio catalog (note that
this is the more appropriate pairing to use, as the surface density of radio sources is a function of
distance from the pointing center of the radio observations due to the power pattern response of
the VLA). This produceda probability of chance superposition of about1.7% for objects separated
by 1′.′5, dropping to less than 1% for sources separated by under 1′′.
All sources in the catalog were then analyzed to remove objects with low significance of radio
detection. After correcting for the power pattern response of the VLA, the local noise around
each radio source was evaluated over a 1.′5 box centered on the radio position. The source itself
was fit using the task JMFIT, which fits Gaussians to the radio emission and returns the best
fit parameters. JMFIT was instructed to correct for the power pattern and also for bandwidth
smearing. Sources for which the fitted major axis had a minimum size of zero were considered
unresolved and their peak flux measurements were adopted as their flux (e.g., Owen et al. 2005),
otherwise the fitted integral flux was adopted. The source flux was then compared to the local
noise figure, and sources with fluxes less than five times the local rms were removed. In practice,
this removed 16 low significance objects from the list of radio sources with optical IDs.
The list of IDs was then checked by a visual inspection of the actual images. Radio contours
were overlaid on the optical images, and all catalog identifications were confirmed. This step also
found one radio galaxy with the morphology of a compact double. The separation between the
optical galaxy position and the nearer of the two radio lobes was more than 1′.′5, and hence would
be excluded in our radio galaxy catalog. However, using the midpoint of the radio lobe positions
results in the source being accepted. This radio galaxy will be discussed in more detail in Section
3.4.2. The final list is presented in Table 2 and includes 175 objects. The majority of these were
classified as galaxies in the SDSS photometric catalogs, although including objects classified as
– 8 –
stars yielded nine detections. Of the optical IDs, 29 are included among our spectroscopic database
and a further six had reported spectroscopy from other sources (including one object with an
SDSS photometric classification of “star,” for which the spectroscopy reveals to be a quasar). This
information is included in Table 2, along with photometric redshifts for sources without optical
spectroscopy (details on the photometric redshifts will be provided in Section 3.4.1). A histogram
of the distribution of magnitudes for the radio sources with optical counterparts is provided in
Figure 2.
3. Analysis
3.1. Cluster Dynamics from Optical Spectroscopy
Thereare196 galaxy velocities presentedinTable1, plusanadditional9targets whosespectra
suggest they are faint stars. Velocity histograms along the line of sight to A2111 are provided in
Figure 3. Using the robust statistics of Beers, Flynn, & Gebhardt (1990), our spectroscopic data
indicate that the observed systemic velocity of the cluster (the biweight location) is 68573 ± 91
km s−1 (z = 0.2287) with a velocity dispersion (the biweight scale) of 889+73 km s−1. These
−59
values are based on 95 cluster galaxies as determined using 3σ clipping, with the galaxy velocities
corrected for measurement errors and relativistic effects. Based on these figures, the ±3σ range of
observed velocities corresponding to the cluster is 65177 – 72014 km s−1. The biweight location
for the cluster center is 15h39m42s.0 +34◦26′27′′, about 80′′ from the adopted X-ray center. Using
these data, we derived a virial mass of 3.6×1015 M⊙. An additional 10 galaxies with velocities
from public sources fall within the range of accepted cluster velocities (five each from NED and the
SDSS), with a further two galaxies just below the lower velocity limit (see Figure 3). Six of the
seven NED velocities, including the two just below the lower velocity limit, come from Lavery &
Henry(1994) andhencemayreflectafairlylargeoffsetfromourmeasurements. However, including
all additional NED and SDSS velocities does not significantly change the cluster systemic velocity
and dispersion,yielding 68536±94 km s−1 and 974+75 km s−1, respectively. Thetwo lower velocity
−61
galaxiesareacceptedasclustermembersinthisextendeddatabaseonaccountoftheirhighassigned
errors of 300 km s−1.
Thevelocity data were subjected to a wide variety of statistical tests designed to evaluate sub-
structure, as described in Pinkney et al. (1996) and references therein. The majority of the tests
indicated no significant substructure, although the bimodality hinted at in the velocity histogram
(Figure 3) did produce some marginal differences from the null hypothesis of a Gaussian veloc-
ity distribution. Substructure tests including positional information failed to indicate significant
substructure with the exception of the Fourier Elongation (FE) test (Pinkney et al. 1996). This
test compares the galaxy distribution to a circularly symmetric distribution, and its significance
is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. None of the 1000 Monte Carlo runs produced a higher
FE test statistic. The elongation is not proof of substructure, but clusters with substructure are
– 9 –
typically elongated. In particular, elongation observed in the X-ray emission of the intracluster gas
is often viewed as evidence for non-relaxed systems as was noted earlier in the description of prior
X-ray results for A2111. The position angle of the elongation in the galaxy distribution, 150◦±8
measured east from north, is consistent with that found in the X-ray analysis of Wang, Ulmer, &
Lavery (1997), 162◦+12 (90% confidence range).
−21
To further investigate the possible bimodality in the cluster population, we used the KMM
algorithm (Ashman, Bird, & Zepf 1994). The first application of KMM was made on the veloc-
ity data only, using the 95 cluster velocities reported in this paper. The input velocities were
cosmologically-corrected to the cluster rest frame, and KMM was allowed to fit two Gaussians with
identical dispersions to the data (i.e., the homoskedastic case). This fit did largely confirm the
impression of bimodality obtained from Figure 3, producing systems with mean velocities of 69177
km s−1 and 67358 km s−1, respectively, after conversion back to observed velocities. The fitted
dispersion for these two groups was 543 km s−1, and 63 galaxies were assigned to the former while
32 were assigned to the latter. The significance of the improvement of this two-component fit over
that of a single Gaussian was fairly modest, at about 96%. The separation of the two components
was quite clean and is easily apparent in Figure 3: the trough in the velocity histogram at 68000
km s−1 is exactly where the split occurred, with higher velocity objects belonging to the larger
system and lower velocity objects belonging to the smaller one.
We also attempted to include positional information in the KMM fitting. In this case, KMM
evaluates the probability for each galaxy to belong to either of two components by considering how
each variable(twopositionalcoordinates andvelocity) comparestothemeansofthosecomponents.
Thethreevariablesareproperlyweightedbytheirindividualdispersionsandcovariances amongthe
variables are taken into account. Provided with the 95 cluster galaxy velocities and their positions,
KMM apportioned the galaxies very differently than it did for the homoskedastic case. The two
fitted components had similar mean values for their positions and velocities but with very different
dispersions in these quantities. Plotting up the positions of the galaxies by fitted component
revealed that KMM had taken the core of the cluster and separated it from its outskirts: the core
had smaller dispersions in the two positional coordinates and a larger dispersion in velocity. The
uncertainty in this split was reflected in a fairly low estimate of correct allocation of galaxies to the
“outskirt” component (73%). KMM is known to be sensitive to outliers, so we next restricted the
input list to galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center. This resulted in a very similar situation to
thehomoskedastic case, withtwo components slightly offset inposition (15h39m48s +34◦25′19′′ and
15h39m36s +34◦26′11′′, each to within an accuracy of about an arcminute) and distinguished more
by their large separation in velocity (69212 km s−1 and 67408 km s−1 observed velocities, or about
1400 km s−1 in the cluster rest frame). The fitted dispersions were 593 km s−1 and 610 km s−1,
with38 galaxies assigned tothefirstcomponentand28 tothesecond. Theactual assignments were
very similar to those made in the homoskedastic case: only four galaxies had different assignments
in the 3D case from those made in the 1D homoskedastic KMM run. All of these had been assigned
to the first component in the homoskedastic fitting but were placed in the second component when
– 10 –
positional data were included. Velocity histograms and galaxy positions for these assignments may
be found in Figure 4. The two brightest galaxies at the cluster center both belong to the first
component. Treating these two components separately, we determined virial masses of 8.5×1014
and 1.1×1015 M⊙, respectively.
3.2. Cluster Blue Fraction
Theavailability of accurate photometric data from theSDSSmakes computation of the cluster
blue fraction a straightforward proposition. In addition, the large spectroscopic database allows
for direct testing of whether the high reported blue fraction for A2111 is significantly biased by
contamination from foreground and background galaxies, as one might naively expect based on the
rich line of sight evidenced in the velocity histogram of Figure 3.
We have emulated the original procedure of Butcher & Oemler (1984) in evaluating the blue
fraction forA2111. Intheir calculation, BO84 usedgalaxy counts with M ≤ −20 andacosmology

with H = 50 km s−1 Mpc−1 and q = 0.1. We have used kcorrect v3.2 (Blanton et al. 2003) to

we determined that m = 20.68 corresponds to the cutoff of M = −20. The BO84 definition of
r V
blue was a B − V color more than 0.2 magnitudes bluer than the E/S0 galaxies in the cluster.
For the SDSS data, this corresponds to 0.2 magnitudes in g−r. The next important step is that
of fitting the color-magnitude (CM) relation in A2111, also referred to as the E/S0 ridgeline. For
this purpose, we have followed the procedure outlined in Lopez-Cruz et al. (2004) and arrived at
(g−r)= 2.28−0.047r (see Figures 5 and 6).
With these results in place, the blue fraction was determined using the SDSS photometric
catalog of galaxies. The BO84 blue fraction was calculated inside a radius of 4.′1, and we found
183 galaxies with m ≤ 20.68 within this distance of our adopted cluster center position. These
r
183 galaxies included 45 which were 0.2 magnitudes or more bluer than the fitted CM relation.
The background was fit using galaxies at large radial separations from the cluster center where the
galaxy surface density had fallen to a constant value. This produced final numbers of 20.1 blue
counts and 134.7 total counts, or f = 0.15±0.03 (see Figure 6). This is in excellent agreement
b
with the original BO84 estimate of f = 0.16±0.03. The lower number of total counts relative to
b
the BO84 value (134.7 compared to 155) was also noted by Lavery & Henry (1986), who opted to
reduce their magnitude limit to reproduce the net counts of BO84.
The spectroscopic observations confirm this high blue fraction in A2111. There are available
redshifts for 44 galaxies in the above analysis, 34 of which are for “red” galaxies and 10 of which
are for “blue” galaxies. The majority of each prove to be cluster members (33 of 34 red galaxies,
9 of 10 blue). Using these fractions to correct the total counts for foreground and background
– 11 –
contamination yields f = 0.23±0.03.
b
We have similarly calculated blue fractions for galaxies with M ≤ −20 under the WMAP
r
cosmology within a radius of 2 Mpc (9.′1). In this case, there were 466 net galaxy counts of which
156 were bluer than the cluster CM relation. The resulting fraction using backgrounds estimated
from the photometry data was f = 0.17 ± 0.03. The spectroscopy data include 64 red galaxies
b
within this area, 56 of which are cluster members.2 For theblue galaxies, these numbersare 42 and
18, respectively. The resulting blue fraction using spectroscopic data to correct for the background
is f =0.20±0.03.

3.3. Spectroscopic Classifications
Thegalaxies withopticalspectrawerealsoclassifiedusingthe“MORPHS”scheme(Dressleret
al.1999; Poggianti etal.1999). Thisisbasedprimarilyontwospectralfeatures,the[Oii]λ3727 line
in emission and the Hδ λ4102 line in absorption. Passive galaxies, defined as those lacking emission
lines, are designated “k” and are further classified on the basis of their Hδ absorption lines: those
with weak Hδ are simply “k” galaxies, while strong Hδ absorption caused by a large population
of young A stars produces a “k+a” classification (or if especially strong, “a+k”). These k+a and
a+k galaxies are often referred to as post-starburst or “E+A” galaxies (Dressler & Gunn 1983).
The presence of [Oii] in emission indicates an active galaxy, with such galaxies being designated
“e()” wherethe parenthetical value takes one of fourpossibleoptions. If examination of line widths
and other lines such as [Oiii] indicate an AGN, the galaxy is classified as “e(n).” Galaxies with
spectra representative of continuous star formation histories evidenced by moderate [Oii] emission
and at most slight Hδ absorption are classified “e(c),” while those with unusually strong [Oii]
emission representative of a current starburst are classified “e(b).” Finally, star forming galaxies
with strong Hδ absorption are classified “e(a).” This type of spectrum appears to arise in dusty
starburst galaxies (Poggianti et al. 1999).
Ourclassifications were made within IRAF through visualinspection of the spectra and fitting
Gaussians to the appropriate lines. This does imply a certain degree of subjectivity, as the S/N of
thespectraareonlymoderateinthevicinity ofHδ (ameanofabout12perresolutionelement, with
a range from 8 to 18) and fitted equivalent widths are influenced by our assumed continuum levels.
However, the objective of making the assigments is to assess trends in the star formation history of
theclustergalaxies asanoverall population. Thus,suchissuesshouldhave minimaleffects. Among
our 95 cluster galaxies with Hydra spectra, we identified 63 galaxies of type k, 5 k+a, 14 e(a), 12
e(c), and 1 e(n). The classifications are presented in Table 3 and example spectra are presented in
Figure 7, with both the lowest and highest S/N spectrum within the major classes plotted. The

analysis with that done for thecluster dynamics.
– 12 –
availability of the SDSS spectroscopy allows classification of another five cluster galaxies, all of
which are of type k. That all the galaxies with SDSS spectra are type k is to be expected, as the
faint limit of the SDSS main galaxy sample is m = 17.77 (Strauss et al. 2002) which corresponds
r
to M = −22.9 for an elliptical in A2111. Some ellipticals fainter than this apparent magnitude
r
limit have SDSS spectra through their selection in the SDSS luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample
(Eisenstein et al. 2001).
3.4. Characterizing the Radio Galaxies
3.4.1. Cluster Radio Galaxies
Table 4 includes the derived quantities for the 14 radio galaxies whose velocities place them
within A2111. The majority of these (9) have optical spectra which indicate their radio emission
arises from active star formation. The remaining five radio galaxies include three passive or k type
galaxies, one emission line AGN, and one galaxy whose velocity was reported in Morrison et al.
(2003). This last galaxy is presumably of type k on the basis of its optical color. The AGN is
among the fainter cluster galaxies with an obtained spectrum (M = −21.3) and is located in a
R
tight grouping of galaxies nearly 2 Mpc to the south of the cluster center.
Radio luminosities for the cluster galaxies were determined using the WMAP cosmology and
assuming a spectral index of 0.7 in performing the k correction (i.e., S ∝ ν−0.7). There are
ν
no cluster galaxies with extended radio morphologies and luminosities representative of Fanaroff
& Riley (1974) class sources. Star formation rates for the active galaxies were derived using the
relationshipinYun,Reddy,&Condon(2001), whichisbasedonthelocalfar-infrared(FIR)density
and the strong correlation between radio and FIR emission in star-forming galaxies. Underlying
assumptions in the FIR-derived SFR, and hence the radio one, are a Salpeter initial mass function
with mass limits of 0.1 and 100 M⊙. With this conversion, the sensitivity limit of the radio
observations translates to about 5.5 M⊙ year−1 (8.5 M⊙ year−1 in the noisier regions within 2 Mpc
of the cluster center). Thus, the radio observations select the more vigorously star-forming galaxies
inthecluster andhencewedetect only 6of the15 spectroscopically-identified e(a) galaxies and3of
the 12 e(c) galaxies. Additionally, many of the non-detected emission line galaxies lie farther from
the cluster center where the sensitivity of the radio observations are lower. Of the 9 undetected
e(a) galaxies, 5 lie over 2 Mpc from the cluster center including one which is outside the region
covered by the radio images. Similarly, 7 of the 9 undetected e(c) galaxies are greater than 2 Mpc
from the cluster center.
An additional use of the kcorrect software is that it can be used to determine photometric
redshifts (z ). These are especially useful for determining the properties of the radio galaxies
phot
without available spectra, and are presented for such cases in Table 2. The1σ error in these values,
determined by comparison of z calculated for all galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts presented
phot
in Table 1, is 0.044 (after 5 sigma clipping and the 1+z correction). From this information we
– 13 –
are also able to identify those radio galaxies without optical spectra which are probable cluster
members. There are 25 possible cluster radio galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center, of which
8 are photometrically classified as “blue” with the remaining 17 being “red.” Allowing a ±3σ
range, galaxies with 0.10 ≤ z ≤ 0.36 are potential cluster members and we find that 7 of the
phot
8 blue galaxies meet this criterion while 5 of the 17 red galaxies do. These 12 potential cluster
radio galaxies are presented in Table 5 along with their absolute quantities calculated under the
assumption of cluster membership. Most are fairly faint optically, providing a simple explanation
for their exclusion in our spectroscopy observations.
3.4.2. Foreground and Background Radio Galaxies
Radio galaxies not located within the cluster are usefulin other investigations. Themore pow-
erfulradiogalaxies, withL & 1023 WHz−1,aregenerally foundinclusterorgroupenvironments.
1.4
This is particularly true for sources with FR1 morphologies (Fanaroff & Riley 1974), which have
twin jets of radio emission which fade with distance from the host galaxy (“edge darkened”). The
bright radio nature of these types of radio galaxies makes them efficient signposts to the presence
of galaxy clusters and groups out to high redshifts(e.g., Blanton et al. 2001; Venemans et al. 2002).
There are 21 radio galaxies with optical spectra indicating they lie in the foreground or back-
ground. The properties of these galaxies are provided in Table 6. Distances, and hence absolute
quantities, are based directly on the measured redshifts; possible peculiar motions of galaxies in
clusters are unaccounted. Based on their optical spectra and radio luminosities, most of the galax-
ies appear to be powered by star formation. The two highest redshift sources, with z = 0.5512 and
z = 0.8718, are quasars with spectra taken from the SDSS DR4. The MORPHS classifications for
foreground and background galaxies are often more uncertain on account of the wavelength cover-
age of the spectra having been optimized for cluster galaxies. Nevertheless, we provide MORPHS
classes for the non-cluster radio galaxies in Table 6 with flags noting where classes are uncertain
due to wavelength coverage or signal-to-noise issues.
Twoforegroundgalaxiesareassociatedwithpowerfulradiosourcesandhencearelikelymarkers
for poor groups. The galaxy J154125+342830 has the twin jet radio morphology of an FR1 and is
presented in Figure 8. Its redshiftis z = 0.1842, producinga radio luminosity of 9.1×1023 W Hz−1

z = 0.1942 has a radio luminosity of 1.6×1024 W Hz−1 and the optical spectrum of an elliptical
galaxy (although with slight measured [Nii] and [Sii]). Its location 16.′1 from the pointing center of
theradioobservations meansitsuffersfromsmearingeffects andconsequently its radiomorphology
is not easily described, although clearly is compact. It is at best marginally resolved by FIRST
(Becker, White, & Helfand 1995), with a deconvolved major axis of 1′.′6 and a flux measurement
of 15.34 mJy, consistent with the measured flux from our observations. Neither galaxy has any
counterparts within 3000 km s−1 and 1 Mpc projected separation in Table 1.

This is the compact double noted in Section 2.3.2, and may be seen in Figure 9. Its photometric
redshift is 0.50. In addition to the two main lobes of radio emission, there is diffuse emission to
the southeast which appears to connect to the southeast lobe. Including this diffuse emission the
system flux is 19.8±0.5 mJy, equivalent to 1.7×1025 W Hz−1. Without the diffuse emission, the
radio flux is still 10.3±0.2 mJy or a luminosity of 8.7×1024 W Hz−1. These values are consistent
with the expectations for radio sources with compact double morphologies at the assumed redshift.
4. Discussion
The objective of our study was to characterize the galaxy population of A2111 and investigate
any possible connection it has with the dynamical state of the cluster. We shall turn first to a
discussion of the overall cluster dynamics and then investigate the active galaxy populations.
4.1. Dynamical Assessment of A2111: Evidence for a Cluster Merger?
The dynamical assessment made from our measured velocities is only suggestive of A2111 rep-
resenting acluster merger. Based on our 95 cluster galaxies, few statistical tests indicate significant
substructure consistent with a merger scenario. The tests performed exclusively on velocity (i.e.,
the “ROSTAT” package of Beers, Flynn, & Gebhardt 1990) produced a few results indicating a
more kurtotic velocity distribution than would be expected should the true velocity distribution be
a Gaussian, yet these were only significant at around the 90% confidence level. Application of the
KMM algorithm did indicate that the velocities were better fit by a pair of Gaussians, as might
resultshouldA2111 betwo separate clusters in theprocess of merging. However, thesignificance of
the improvement of this fit over a single Gaussian was only a modest 96%. Inclusion of positional
information did little to change this interpretation, as all but two of the 2D and 3D tests described
in Pinkney et al. (1996) failed to indicate significant substructure at even the 90% confidence level.
For one of these two, the ∆ test (Dressler & Shectman 1988), the marginal significance (98 of
1000 Monte Carlo shuffles of the velocity data while holding the positions fixed produced higher
∆ statistics) is likely not related to substructure so much as sampling. Restricting the analysis
to galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center, the signficance declines to about 75% (255 of 1000
MC runs with higher ∆). The ∆ test uses nearest neighbors to identify local deviations from the
overall systemic velocity or dispersion. Much of the higher ∆ for the full sample results from the
lower velocity dispersion of galaxies at the periphery of the cluster, which is expected for relaxed
systems. The 66 galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center have σ = 951+96 km s−1, while the
v −74
29 outside this radial limit have σ = 711+118 km s−1.
v −79
It is interesting, however, that the one significant substructure test matches so well with the
X-ray data. The Fourier Elongation (FE) test yielded highly significant evidence for an elongated
– 15 –
galaxydistribution,withnoneof1000MCsimulationsproducingastrongersignatureofelongation.
This result was unchanged when only galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center were considered
(in this case, 1 of 1000 MC runs had higher FE). As noted earlier, the derived position angle
of the galaxy distribution is consistent with the large-scale X-ray emission. This alignment was
noted by Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997), along with its consistency to the alignment of the two
brightest galaxies at the cluster core. This overall impression may be seen in Figure 10 which
depicts the R-band optical image with overlaid contours of the X-ray emission from the ROSAT
PSPC observation. Comparison with the galaxy distributions from the KMM analysis (Figure 4)
suggests a connection between the extension of the X-ray emission to the northwest of the cluster
center and the second fitted group.

by Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997) and later Henriksen, Wang, & Ulmer (1999)? The merger
interpretation of the X-ray data was based on the asymmetric X-ray morphology which leads to
shiftsinthefittedcentroidandellipticitywithscale,alongwiththepresenceofahighertemperature
core. These results are consistent with hydro/N-body simulations after the subcluster has passed
through the core of the primary cluster (Roettiger, Burns, & Loken 1993). The simulations of
Pinkney et al. (1996) indicate that substructure tests performed exclusively on velocities generally
do not produce significant results within 2 Gyr of the time when the cores of merging clusters
are coincident, provided the difference between the merger axis and the line of sight is greater
than about 30◦. Were the difference between the viewing angle and the merger axis smaller than
this amount, the velocity data would almost certainly produce significant deviations from the null
hypothesis of a single Gaussian velocity distribution. Folding in the results of the KMM analysis
thatthetwopossiblemergingpartnershavenearlyequaldispersionbutareseparated invelocity by
∼ 1400 km s−1, the substructure tests would argue for the system being viewed shortly after core
passage. This same description of the merger timing and geometry can be consistent with the tests
which include positional information. The FE statistic is quite good at times near core passage,
provided the system is not viewed along the merger axis (i.e., the same constraint resulting from
the lack of significant tests based exclusively on velocities). The remaining tests generally do not
produce significant results shortly after core passage, with the possible exception of the ∆ test. In
summary, while the substructure tests on the galaxy position and velocity data do not themselves
providestrongevidenceforaclustermerger,theyareconsistentwiththeinterpretationoftheX-ray
data that a head-on cluster merger has occurred recently provided that the merger axis is & 30◦
different from the line of sight. Finally, we note that the merging partners implied by the KMM
fit meet the Newtonian condition for a bound system if the difference between the merger axis and
the line of sight is between 5◦ and 73◦. Thus, the X-ray and optical data may be explained by a
cluster-cluster merger provided the viewing angle is between about 30◦ and 70◦ from the merger
axis and the system is seen near the time when the cores of the progenitor clusters are coincident.

4.2. Active Galaxies in A2111: Colors, Spectra, and Radio Properties
The SDSS photometric data and our spectroscopy confirm the high blue fraction for A2111,
indentifying it as an active cluster. Similarly, the blue galaxies do appear to be a dynamically
young population with a higher velocity dispersion than that of the red galaxy population. The
velocity dispersion of the red galaxies from our spectroscopic observations (72 members) is 807+77
−60
km s−1 whereas for the blue galaxies (23 members) it is 1128+217 km s−1, a difference significant
−138
at just over 2σ. This general result is unchanged if we consider only those galaxies within 2 Mpc,
and suggests that the blue galaxies are more representative of an infalling population which has
not virialized. Previous Butcher-Oemler studies have noted the same general effect (e.g., Lavery &
Henry 1994, and references therein).
The interpretation of the blue galaxies as active galaxies which represent the infalling popula-
tion does not translate simply to the spectroscopic classifications of the galaxies. In fact, there is
no significant difference between the velocity dispersion of the passive, non-emission line galaxies
compared to the emission line galaxies. The former have a velocity dispersion of 860+85 km s−1
−66
while the latter have a velocity dispersion of 737+128 km s−1. In this case, the effect of including
−84
only galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center is larger as the emission line galaxies are more
likely to be located at greater clustercentric distance where the local velocity dispersion is lower.
There are 27 total emission line galaxies, of which 14 lie outside 2 Mpc. Using only galaxies within
2 Mpc, the velocity dispersion of the emission line galaxies rises to 1038+298 km s−1, although this
−160
is still consistent with the dispersion of the non-emission line galaxies.
Of course, one reason for any differences in the calculated dispersions is that the simple corre-
spondence of a blue galaxy being an emission line galaxy is often false. Of the 27 cluster emission
line galaxies, eight have colors consistent with the cluster red sequence. One of these is the AGN
J153945.7+341625, whiletheother sevenhave spectraof star-forminggalaxies. Star-forminggalax-
ies with colors consistent with a cluster’s red sequence have been identified previously by several
authors (Homeier et al. 2005; Wolf, Gray, & Meisenheimer 2005). There are also exceptions on the
converse side, with four non-emission line galaxies having blue colors. Two of these are k+a galax-
ies, J153938.7+342639 and J153941.9+342420, where the blue color is consistent with the recent
burst of star formation implied by the A star features in the galaxies’ spectra (the strong Balmer
absorption and blue color for these particular galaxies are also noted in Lavery & Henry 1994).
These two galaxies also lie very close to the center of the cluster, with projected clustercentric
distances of 360 and 170 kpc. The remaining two passive cluster galaxies with blue colors are also
located near the cluster center (about 0.6 and 1.1 Mpc). Although not detected by the radio data,
they are potentially analogs to the cluster star-forming galaxies without notable emission lines in
the blue portion of their spectra identified in Miller & 0wen (2002).
The spectral classifications of the galaxies in combination with the radio data do indicate
evidence for starburst activity in member galaxies, with the strong suggestion that dust extinction
is important. Although our MORPHS classifications of cluster galaxies include no e(b) galaxies,
– 17 –
such types of objects are generally rare in clusters. Of the ten clusters studied by Dressler et al.
(1999), most have only 0 to 2 such galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with e(b) spectra are almost
always intrinsically fairly faint (Poggianti et al. 1999) and our spectroscopy is primarily of brighter
cluster galaxies (with M . −21.5). Thisis compoundedby ourradio detection limit, which would
R
require relatively high SFR for such galaxies. Even so, there may be examples of e(b) galaxies
among the radio galaxies with photometric redshifts consistent with cluster membership (Table 5),
as these were typically missed by our spectroscopy on account of their fainter magnitudes. There
are, however, 14 e(a) galaxies identified in A2111, including six associated with radio emission.
Models and nearby examples of galaxies with such spectra indicate that e(a) galaxies are dusty
starbursts, where emission line regions face larger extinction than the more dispersed young star
(∼A) population (e.g., Poggianti et al. 1999; Shioya, Bekki, & Couch 2001). The e(a) galaxies in
A2111 include the strongest cluster radio galaxy, J153949.3+342640, an Sc galaxy (morphology
from Fasano et al. 2000) in the cluster core with L = 9.3×1022 W Hz−1. This translates to a
1.4
SFR of over 55 M⊙ year−1. Finally, two of the three radio-detected e(c) cluster galaxies have colors
which place them along the cluster red sequence. If these are also dusty star-forming galaxies as
suggested by Wolf, Gray, & Meisenheimer (2005), their radio emission implies SFRs of 17 and 27
M⊙ year−1.
Smail et al. (1999) examined the cluster A851 and identified several k+a galaxies with radio
emission, concluding that these were likely highly dust-enshrouded starbursts. Such spectra are
essentially an extreme manifestation of the e(a) class, in which dust extinction has removed even
the [Oii] line. The rms sensitivity of the Smail et al. (1999) data corresponds to a 5σ limit of 14.2
M⊙ year−1, meaning k+a galaxies in A2111 with comparable SFR would be detected. None of the
five k+a galaxies in our spectroscopic data are formal radio detections, however we note that one is
identified with low significance. The k+a galaxy J153938.7+342639 is resolved and has an integral
flux of 99±41 µJy and a local noise of 13 µJy, however it did not enter our catalog of possible
radio sources as its peak flux was only 40 µJy. The integral flux of this galaxy corresponds to a
SFR of 8.4 M⊙ year−1. It is one of the two blue k+a galaxies near the cluster core.
Are such findings on star formation in A2111 unusual relative to other clusters? First, we
compare the populations in the various spectroscopic classes with those of the ten clusters with
0.37 ≤ z ≤ 0.56 used in the MORPHS study. In general, the fraction of star-forming galaxies is
consistent with the overall results of the MORPHS study. We find that 0.13±0.03 of the A2111
galaxies have e(c) spectra, whereas thefraction forthis class in theMORPHSstudywas 0.14±0.02.
Similarly, A2111 has an e(a) fraction of 0.15±0.04 compared to the MORPHS result of 0.11±0.02.
The possible excess in the e(a) population is offset by the noted lack of e(b) galaxies in A2111,
which make up 0.05±0.01 of the MORPHS sample. Our A2111 spectroscopy are more discrepant
with the MORPHS results when we consider passive galaxies. In particular, we findrelatively more
k type galaxies (0.67±0.05 compared to 0.48±0.04) at the expense of k+a galaxies (0.05±0.02
comparedto0.21±0.02). Inpart,someoftheseminordifferencesmaybecausedbysamplingasour
spectroscopic sampling is ≈ 0.5 magnitude less deep than the MORPHS. Thus, we are less likely to
– 18 –
observe the fainter galaxies (especially e(b) galaxies) and will hence have a higher fraction of the
brighter spectroscopic classes (i.e., the k galaxies). We do, however, sample a larger physical area
than theMORPHS.Based on theradial distributionsof thevarious spectroscopic classes, wewould
expect this to increase the relative numbers of active galaxies as these are less concentrated in the
cluster cores. These arguments do not apply to the apparent deficit in k+a galaxies, however. In
the MORPHS work, such spectral types are nearly as bright as the k galaxies and only slightly less
centrally concentrated. Only one of the seven MORPHS clusters (Cl1447+23) has a k+a fraction
which is not significantly (i.e., at 2σ) greater than that of A2111. In a general sense, with the
exception of the k+a galaxies, the relative fractions of the various spectral classes indicate that
despite its lower redshift A2111 has active galaxy populations typical of higher redshift clusters.
Second, we can qualitatively compare theradio galaxy population of A2111 with other clusters
studied by radio observations. If we restrict the comparison to galaxies within 2 Mpc of cluster
centers and with L ≥ 1.4×1022 W Hz−1 (i.e., 5σ detections in the noisier region of our data),
1.4
there are 11 spectroscopically confirmed cluster radio galaxies in A2111 plus an additional 10
with photometric redshifts suggestive of cluster membership. Inclusion of the photometric redshift
sources is probably wise, since the clusters to which we draw comparisons are generally studied
down to fainter optical limits. Working in the opposite direction is the known correlation that
optically faint galaxies are not often associated with radio sources at luminosities above our noted
limit (e.g., Miller & 0wen 2002). In the highly active cluster A2125 at the comparable redshift of
z = 0.2465, there are 43 galaxies within 2 Mpc and with L ≥ 1.4×1022 W Hz−1 (Owen et al.
1.4
2005). When factoring in the apparently lower richness of A2125 relative to A2111 (N values
30
of 62 and 155, respectively, from Butcher & Oemler 1984), it is clear that A2111 is less active.
At lower redshift, the active cluster A2255 (z = 0.0800) has 15 radio galaxies meeting the above
criteria (Miller &Owen 2003). Onlyfiveofthese arepoweredby star formation, with fourclassified
as e(c) and one as e(a). Still, this is about twice the radio galaxy population of the comparable
richness Coma cluster.
One possible difference of A2111 from other clusters with large active galaxy populations
identified is in its lack of powerful radio AGN, in particular the sources with extended radio mor-
phologies and high luminosities. In fact, there are no FR1 or FR2 type sources in A2111, which is
fairly unusual for a rich cluster of galaxies. A851 is the MORPHS cluster best-studied in the radio
(Morrison et al. 2005), and it also has a large population of radio-detected star-forming galaxies
without any FR1 or FR2 galaxies. Venturi et al. (2000) suggest that cluster mergers may switch
off powerful radio galaxies, based on an apparent lack of such objects in A3558. In contrast, the
above mentioned A2255 has six: three head-tail radio galaxies and a strong compact double near
the cluster core, plus a wide-angle tail and narrow-angle tail each about 1.5 Mpc from the cluster
center.
Finally, we have investigated whether there were any significant differences in the galaxy pop-
ulations between the two components identified by the KMM analysis. Such a difference might
result should one component be associated with an active population merging with a more quies-
– 19 –
cent population describing the main cluster. We tested the blue fractions, emission line fractions,
and radio galaxy fractions and found no statistical difference in these quantities between the two
fitted components (for both the fits found using only velocity data and those found using positions
as well as velocities). Although not statistically significant, we note that the second component
in the KMM fit using a radial cutoff of 2 Mpc and both positional and velocity data included
both blue k+a galaxies. The five emission line galaxies assigned to this component were all of the
e(a) spectral class and were also all blue. The X-ray data provide circumstantial evidence that this
second fitted component is associated with themorediffusetrail of X-ray emission to thenorthwest
of the cluster center (Figures 4 and 10).
5. Conclusions
We have presented an in-depth analysis of the Butcher-Oemler cluster A2111. This analysis
was based on optical spectroscopy providing 196 galaxy spectra, plus multicolor optical imaging
from the SDSS and a deep VLA radio continuum image. This combination has been extremely
effective in providing a coherent picture of the situation in this cluster.
The optical spectroscopy included 95 confirmed cluster members that allowed us to make a
detailed dynamical analysis of the cluster. A large number of statistical tests of substructure were
applied, producing only one significant result: the galaxy distribution in A2111 is elongated, with
the position angle consistent with that determined from prior X-ray analysis. The velocity data
thereby do not themselves provide significant evidence for A2111 being a cluster merger, however
they are consistent with this dynamical assessment provided the system is viewed near the time
whenthecores ofthetwoprogenitor clustershavecrossed. Inaddition,thestatistical tests required
that the viewing angle is & 30◦ different from the merger axis.
With theSDSS data and our spectroscopy we have confirmedthe high bluefraction for A2111.
Based on the photometry data alone and using the same aperture as Butcher & Oemler (1984),
we derived a blue fraction of f = 0.15±0.03. Redshifts are available for 44 of the galaxies that
b
entered this analysis, which revealed that 9 of 10 blue galaxies and 33 of 34 red galaxies are cluster
members. Using these figures to account for the background produced f = 0.23 ±0.03, further
b
strengthening A2111’s description as a high blue fraction cluster.
The optical spectroscopy and radio data reveal a substantial population of dusty starbursts
within the cluster. The sensitivity of the radio data imply that galaxies with SFR as low as 5.5
M⊙ yr−1 are detected, and we identified 9 radio galaxies with spectra indicative of star formation
from our spectroscopy database. Most of these have “e(a)” type spectra, arguing that they are
dusty starbursts. Indeed, the strongest radio source in the cluster is of this variety and has a radio
SFR of 55 M⊙ yr−1. In addition to the radio galaxies with attendant spectroscopy, we identified
12 galaxies whose photometric redshifts are consistent with their being cluster members. Over half
of these had blue colors representative of starbursts. Photometric redshifts were presented for all
– 20 –
SDSS objects associated with radio emission, in hope that they will prove useful in other studies.
In total, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that dynamically-active clusters are
associated with more active member galaxies than relaxed clusters.

aA consistent velocity was found for this galaxy via cross cor-
relation of absorption features with velocity standards.
bA velocity for this galaxy is also reported in NED.
cA velocity for this galaxy is also in the SDSS DR4.
Note. — All reported velocities are heliocentric. When a ve-
locity has been determined on the basis of emission lines, these
lines are noted in the “Lines” column. If identified lines are off-
set by parentheses, they were not used to determine the reported
velocity but were found to be consistent with that velocity. Note
that [Oiii] usually refers to the λ5007 line, but sometimes also
includes the λ4959 line. Similarly, [Nii] is usually the λ6584 line
but may also include the λ6548 line and [Sii] may be either or
both of λ6717 and λ6731.

Note. — SN is the signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element
in the vicinity of Hδ. Color is simply R for consistent with red
sequence, BifblueinBO84 sense(i.e., ∆(g−r) ≤ −0.2). Distance
is in Mpc from cluster center. Radio is N for non-detected, D for
detected and in Table 4, and O for outside surveyed area.

aBased on the color and/or optical spectrum, the galaxy is likely to be an AGN and
hence the SFR is an upper limit due to inclusion of radio emission associated with the
active nucleus.
bNoisy spectrum, so Hδ absorption may be insufficient for e(a) classification.
cSeyfert 2 spectrum.
dVelocity reported in Morrison et al. (2003).
Note. — Apparent R magnitudes were estimated from the SDSS u g r i z magnitudes
using the observed redshifts and kcorrect software (Blanton et al. 2003), with the abso-
lute R magnitudes based on D = 1129 Mpc, z = 0.2287, and A = 0.07. ∆(g −r) is
L R
color relative to the cluster CM relation. Values less than -0.2 are thus considered blue
in the Butcher-Oemler sense. The radio luminosities were calculated assuming a spectral
index of 0.7.

eFormally an e(c) on basis of EW([Oii])< 40, but EW(Hα+[Nii])> 100
warrants classification as e(b).
fHβ is present but contaminated by telluric 5577 line, [Oii] and Hα
outside wavelength coverage. [Oiii] emission is very slight and the rest
frame color is blue, so tentative classification of e(c) is assigned.
gNarrow line AGN, QSO in SDSS.
hSpectral wavelength coverage does not include Hδ. The classification
is based on other Balmer lines.
iPossibly a weak AGN, as the spectrum includes weak [Oii] and [Oiii],
but no Hβ. Similarly, the rest frame color is moderately red.
