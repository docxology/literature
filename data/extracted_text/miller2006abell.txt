ABSTRACT
We present an in-depth analysis of the Butcher-Oemler clust er A2111, including new
optical spectroscopy plus a deep Very Large Array (VLA) radi o continuum observation.
These are combined with optical imaging from the Sloan Digit al Sky Survey (SDSS)
to assess the activity and properties of member galaxies. Pr ior X-ray studies have sug-
gested A2111 is a head-on cluster merger, a dynamical state w hich might be connected
to the high level of activity inferred from its blue fraction . We are able to directly
assess this claim, using our spectroscopic data to identify 95 cluster members among
196 total galaxy spectra. These galaxy velocities do not the mselves provide signiﬁcant
evidence for the merger interpretation, however they are co nsistent with it provided the
system is viewed near the time of core passage and at a viewing angle ≳ 30◦ diﬀerent
from the merger axis. The SDSS data allow us to conﬁrm the high blue fraction for
A2111, fb = 0 . 15 ± 0. 03 based on photometry alone and fb = 0 . 23 ± 0. 03 using spectro-
scopic data to remove background galaxies. We are able to det ect 175 optical sources
from the SDSS in our VLA radio data, of which 35 have redshift i nformation. We use
the SDSS photometry to determine photometric redshifts for the remaining 140 radio-
optical sources. In total we identify up to 26 cluster radio g alaxies, 14 of which have
spectroscopic redshifts. The optical spectroscopy and rad io data reveal a substantial
population of dusty starbursts within the cluster. The high blue fraction and prevalence
of star formation is consistent with the hypothesis that dyn amically-active clusters are
associated with more active member galaxies than relaxed cl usters.

1. Introduction
The discovery of the Butcher-Oemler eﬀect (Butcher & Oemler 1 984, hereafter BO84) has led to
an unusual bias in the study of galaxy evolution in clusters. As the Butcher-Oemler eﬀect indicates
galaxy clusters were more active at earlier epochs, there ha s been great interest in the study of
clusters at higher and higher redshift. This interest has al so been fueled by better observational
capabilities, which have increasingly made it possible to o btain high quality data at fainter limits.
These same factors have sparked continued interest in low re dshift clusters of galaxies; well-studied
low redshift clusters are the necessary benchmark for compa rison with higher redshift samples, and
provide the best opportunity to probe deep into luminosity f unctions. The result of these trends is
that many intermediate redshift clusters ( z ∼ 0. 2) have been largely overlooked.
Abell 2111, at z = 0 . 23, has the distinction of being the richest cluster in the or iginal BO84
study with N30 = 155 (i.e., 30% of the cluster’s total projected galaxies am ounts to 155 galaxies).
For reference, the next richest cluster in that study, A520, had N30 = 126 and the 3C295 cluster
which inspired the original research had only N30 = 45. A2111 also was among the higher blue
fraction clusters noted in BO84 at fb = 0 . 16 ± 0. 03. The primary concern with the interpretation
of the BO84 results was that of contamination, prompting sub sequent campaigns to obtain optical
spectroscopy and conﬁrm whether the blue galaxies were trul y cluster members or simply galaxies
viewed in projection on the clusters. Consequently, spectr oscopy results for 24 galaxies in the
direction of A2111 were presented by Lavery & Henry (1986). T hese included 14 cluster members
and conﬁrmed the high blue fraction determined photometric ally by BO84. The same authors
further investigated the Butcher-Oemler eﬀect using their A 2111 data along with several other
clusters, and found evidence that the blue galaxies often ha d nearby companions indicative of
galaxy-galaxy mergers (Lavery & Henry 1988) and that their m orphologies frequently included
disks (Lavery & Henry 1994). However, outside of these paper s and the presentation of galaxy
morphologies within the very core of the cluster (Fasano et a l. 2000), there has been little optical
study of A2111.
In addition to its richness and high blue fraction, X-ray stu dies of A2111 reveal an interesting
cluster. Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997) presented ROSAT observations of A2111 in conjunction
with optical imaging in R-band. The X-ray data revealed a complex morphology for the i ntracluster
gas, including elongated emission whose degree of elongati on changes with intensity. The cluster X-
ray emission was further decomposed into a main component wi th a superimposed subcomponent.
The subcomponent consisted of a main central blob located be tween the two bright galaxies at
the cluster center, a diﬀuse twisted tail to the northwest, an d a lobe to the southeast. This was
– 3 –
interpreted as evidence for A2111 representing a head-on me rger. The subcluster would have entered
from the northwest, leaving the diﬀuse tail. Its core, the cen tral blob of emission, would be heated
as it plowed through the center of the main cluster component . The ROSAT data did indicate a
higher temperature for the blob, which was later conﬁrmed by ASCA (Henriksen, Wang, & Ulmer
1999). Related studies have argued that cluster mergers evi denced by the elliptical appearance
of their X-ray emitting intracluster gas are intimately rel ated to galaxy evolution and high blue
fractions (Wang & Ulmer 1997; Metevier, Romer, & Ulmer 2000) .
Recent investigations of the radio galaxy populations of cl usters have also yielded tantalizing
evidence that cluster mergers may be associated with increa sed galaxy activity. The best-studied
example is A2125, a high blue fraction cluster at z = 0 . 25. In an initial study using the NRAO
Very Large Array (VLA), Dwarakanath & Owen (1999) and Owen et al. (1999) found a much
higher detection rate for A2125 galaxies relative to the com parable richness but low blue fraction
cluster A2645. The signiﬁcance of the radio data is that radi o emission from individual galaxies is
an excellent tracer of star formation and AGN activity (e.g. , Condon 1992; Yun, Reddy, & Condon
2001). In the absence of an AGN, the radio continuum emission (typically at 1.4 GHz) is a nearly
direct measure of the star formation rate (SFR). The princip al diﬀerence between A2125 and A2645
was their dynamical states, with A2125 being a probable clus ter merger and A2645 a relaxed cluster.
Further investigation of A2125, including optical spectro scopy of hundreds of galaxies (Miller et
al. 2004) and deeper, higher resolution radio observations and ancillary data (Owen et al. 2005)
supported the dynamical assessment and strengthened the as sociation of the radio detections with
actively star-forming galaxies. Additional examples of dy namically-active clusters with increased
populations of radio galaxies are gradually being identiﬁe d (A2255, A3562, A851; Miller & Owen
2003; Miller 2005; Morrison et al. 2005). In the case of A851, radio observations proved especially
fruitful as several galaxies with post-starburst optical s pectra – and hence no optical evidence for
current star formation – appear to be heavily dust-enshroud ed starbursts (Smail et al. 1999). The
activity of these galaxies was revealed through their detec tion at radio wavelengths.
In this paper, we present a detailed multiwavelength analys is of A2111. It includes much more
comprehensive optical spectroscopy than previously publi shed, with over 200 collected spectra.
These data enable us to present a dynamical analysis of the cl uster in order to assess the hypothesis
that A2111 is a cluster merger. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS, York et al. 2000) has
also recently covered A2111, thereby providing accurate mu ltiband photometry of cluster galaxies.
With these data and our spectroscopy, we re-investigate the cluster blue fraction: is A2111 truly
a “blue” cluster, or is it signiﬁcantly contaminated by fore ground and background galaxies? What
do the spectra tell us about the cluster galaxies – is there ev idence for current or recent starbursts,
potentially related to the cluster dynamical state? Finall y, we present a deep VLA radio continuum
observation of A2111. The radio data achieve an rms sensitiv ity of 13 µJy, thereby detecting cluster
galaxies with SFR as low as 5.5 M ⊙ year−1 (using the relationship of Yun, Reddy, & Condon 2001,
which assumed a Salpeter IMF from 0.1 to 100 M ⊙). In addition to study of the cluster itself,
the multiwavelength data are a useful dataset for understan ding galaxy evolution from deep ﬁeld
– 4 –
observations. Thus, all optical sources with associated ra dio detections are reported along with
useful information such as photometric redshifts (or spect roscopic redshifts when available).
Unless otherwise stated, we adopt the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probecosmology with
H0 = 71 km s −1 Mpc−1 and Ω m = 0 . 27 and Ω Λ = 0 . 73 (Spergel et al. 2003). This translates to
1′′ equaling 3.6 kpc at A2111. The assumed cluster center positi on is 15 h39m40.s9 +34 ◦25′04′′ (all
reported coordinates are J2000) taken from the X-ray analys is of Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997).
This lies between the two brightest optical galaxies, often associated with the cluster center. The
ﬁrst of these, at 15 h39m40.s5 +34 ◦25′27′′, has historically been used as the cluster center (e.g.,
Sandage, Kristian, & Westphal 1976). The second is located 4 7′′ away at 15 h39m41.s8 +34 ◦24′43′′.
2. Data
2.1. Optical Spectroscopy
Galaxy spectra within the ﬁeld of A2111 were obtained using t he Hydra multiﬁber spectrograph
on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope during 1996. Several clusters wer e the targets of these observations,
and the reader is referred to Miller et al. (2004) for additio nal details on the data collection,
reduction, and analysis. Brieﬂy, three ﬁber conﬁgurations were observed during 1996 May 20–22,
with a fourth observed on 1996 June 10–11 (this fourth conﬁgu ration was obtained during queue
mode scheduling). Typically around 30 of the 96 available ﬁb ers were assigned to random locations
to produce a good quality sky spectrum for subtraction. The o bservations all used the blue ﬁbers
(3.′′1) and a 400 line mm −1 grating blazed at 4000 ˚
A, with the resulting spectra having a resolution of
7˚
A and spanning from about 4300 ˚
A to 7500 ˚
A. Each ﬁber conﬁguration was observed multiple times
to facilitate cosmic ray rejection, with total exposure tim es ranging from 2 to 5 hours. Standard
calibration exposures were also obtained (bias frames, ﬂat ﬁelds, ﬁber ﬂats for tracing extraction
apertures, and CuAr lamps for wavelength calibration), how ever, no ﬂux calibration was performed.
Velocities were measured by cross correlation with velocit y standards using the IRAF RV
package (Tonry & Davis 1979), and by Gaussian ﬁtting of emiss ion lines. For the cross correlations,
a set of 22 velocity standard templates were used with the ado pted velocity representing a weighted
average of the results from the individual templates (for de tails see Miller et al. 2004). Initial errors
in cross correlation velocities were based on the goodness o f ﬁt, R, such that δcz = 280(1 + R)−1
km s −1 (Hill & Oegerle 1998). A velocity for an emission line object was simply determined as the
mean of the velocity implied by each of its ﬁtted lines, shift ed by the heliocentric correction. The
initial error for an emission line measured velocity was sim ply the dispersion of the individual line
ﬁts divided by the square root of the number of ﬁtted lines (i. e., the error in the mean). If a given
galaxy had both a cross correlation and an emission line reds hift, we adopted the measurement with
the lower error. There were 20 such galaxies, and the velocit ies were found to be highly consistent
with the largest diﬀerence between a cross correlation and em ission line redshift being 120 km s −1.
Finally, an additional error of 40 km s −1 was added in quadrature to the error for each measured
– 5 –
velocity. This value was determined based on repeated obser vations of velocity standards over the
course of the observations (see Miller et al. 2004).
The ﬁnal velocities are presented in Table 1. In addition, we have used the NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database (NED) to identify galaxies with vel ocity measurements in the literature
and within 22 .′5 of the center of A2111, with this radius chosen based on our r adio data (see
Section 2.3). It corresponds to a linear diameter of 9.8 Mpc a t the redshift of A2111. In total,
there were 13 galaxies in the A2111 ﬁeld which had NED velocit ies, six of which are also found in
Table 1. Our velocities are on average about 100 km s −1 greater, with a large dispersion of nearly
700 km s −1. The NED velocities come from three prior works: Lavery & Hen ry (1994) 1, Crawford
et al. (1999), and Morrison et al. (2003). The bulk of the disc repancy between our velocities and
those in NED can be attributed to a fairly large oﬀset from the L avery & Henry (1994) values, which
are fairly coarse estimates (they are presented in terms of r edshift out to three decimal places, and
hence have an implied error of ∼ 300 km s −1). For the three galaxies in common with Lavery &
Henry, our velocities are on average about 600 km s −1 greater. Similarly, spectroscopy covering the
A2111 ﬁeld has recently become available in the Sloan Digita l Sky Survey Data Release 4 (DR4,
Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2005). There are 19 galaxy velociti es in common with those in Table 1.
The mean diﬀerence in velocity between our measurements and t he SDSS values is 15 km s −1 with
a dispersion of 56 km s −1, and hence an associated error in the mean of 13 km s −1. Thus, our
velocities are consistent with those of the SDSS. We also not e this is a useful check on our derived
errors. The dispersion in the mean velocity diﬀerence betwee n our values and those of the SDSS
represents the combined errors of the two measurements. The SDSS quotes an rms velocity error
of ∼ 30 km s −1, which would imply our velocity error is ∼ 45 km s −1. Indeed, this uncertainty is
typical of those velocities presented in Table 1.
2.2. Optical Imaging
High quality optical imaging of A2111 is available from the S DSS Data Release 3 (DR3 Abaza-
jian et al. 2005). This provides imaging in ﬁve ﬁlters, u g r i z , with point source detection limits
in magnitudes ranging from 20.5 ( z) to 22.2 ( g and r) and photometric calibration good to about
2%. The full width half maximum of the PSF in r is typically around 1 .′′4.
Photometric data for all objects within the A2111 ﬁeld were o btained from the DR3. The
adopted magnitudes corresponded to the “best” magnitudes, which are determined using the latest
version of the SDSS reduction pipeline (the pipeline has bee n unchanged since the release of the
DR2 Abazajian et al. 2004). They are model magnitudes based o n the AB magnitude system,
and correspond to the better of an exponential or DeVaucoule urs proﬁle ﬁt. In addition to this
1A prior paper (Lavery & Henry 1986) detailed the spectroscop ic data, which were collected in the mid-1980s, but
the derived redshifts were not speciﬁcally noted until Lave ry & Henry (1994).
– 6 –
catalog data, FITS images were obtained for visual inspecti on of possible radio sources (see Section
2.3.2). We have also used an R image kindly provided by Glenn Morrison for visual conﬁrmat ions
of sources in the inner regions of the surveyed area. This ima ge was obtained using the KPNO
0.9m with the T2KA CCD, providing a 23 ′ by 23 ′ ﬁeld of view. Details may be found in Morrison
et al. (2003).
2.3. Radio Continuum Imaging
2.3.1. Observations and Reductions
The radio data were collected using the VLA under program cod e AM759. A total of ten
hours of time were scheduled, consisting of a pair of ﬁve-hou r tracks centered on the transit of
A2111 on 2003 June 4 and 2003 June 9. The VLA was in its largest c onﬁguration (A array),
producing 1 .′′5 resolution images for the 1.4 GHz observations. The usual “ 4” mode was used for
the correlator, which results in seven 3.125 MHz channels at each of two IFs for both right and left
circular polarization. This allows for deep imaging by redu cing the eﬀects of bandwidth smearing
over the large primary beam area. An integration time of 10 se conds was used, which reduced the
size of the ( u,v) data set at the expense of some time-average smearing. The p ointing center was
15h39m41s +34◦25′04′′.
Calibration was achieved in AIPS via the standard procedure s. The raw data were loaded
including antenna-speciﬁc weights, which account for diﬀer ences in observed system temperature
among the 27 antennas. Flux calibration was based on observa tions of 3C286, and the source
1602+334 was observed roughly every 45 minutes for the purpo se of phase and bandpass calibration.
It lies within 5 ◦ of A2111. Additional self-calibration of the ( u,v) data was performed during the
imaging steps.
Imaging was performed using the AIPS task IMAGR. This includ ed multiple facets to account
for sky curvature over the large primary beam size (the “3D eﬀe ct”). The majority of the primary
beam, a radius of 22 .′5 which translates to about the radius where the response is a bout 20% of that
at the pointing center, was imaged in 37 facets each of 1024 × 1024 0 .′′4 pixels. An additional 19
facets were devoted to bright sources at the very edges of the primary beam and in the sidelobes.
The overall procedure was incremental, with imaging follow ed by inspection of the images and
boxing of detected sources to be used as input to subsequent i maging runs. Self-calibration steps
were also included, initially just in phase and later in both amplitude and phase. The ﬁnal images
had a 1 .′′51 × 1.′′50 FWHM beam, with most facets having an rms noise of 13 µJy. The noise was
higher in the vicinity of a few bright sources, although only one of these was located within 2 Mpc
of the cluster center (J153912.0+342933). Near this source , the rms noise rises to 20 µJy.
A catalog of radio sources was then constructed from the 37 pr imary facets using the AIPS
task SAD. This catalog was meant to be fairly generous in dete ction of sources, and SAD extracted
– 7 –
sources for which the peak and integral ﬂuxes were above 52 µJy (i.e., 4 σ sources at the pointing
center). SAD was also directed to create residual maps which were inspected to identify any sources
missed by the algorithm. These were added to the output catal og manually. All possible sources
were later subjected to more rigorous standards after corre lating with the optical data, as detailed
in the next section.
2.3.2. Optical IDs for Radio Sources
The SDSS photometric database of all detected objects withi n the A2111 ﬁeld was correlated
with the preliminary radio catalog. The search radius for th is correlation was 1 .′′5, as determined by
examining the distribution of the separations of each optic al source to its nearest radio source (see
Figure 1). The presence of real associations means this dist ribution peaks near a separation of zero,
then declines rapidly. As the search radius increases, rand om associations become more likely and
the distribution increases steadily. The 1 .′′5 search radius covers the real associations while limiting
the number of chance superpositions. The number of chance su perpositions in the ﬁnal list of radio
sources with corresponding optical detections was evaluat ed by determining the average density
of objects from the optical catalog around the positions of s ources in the radio catalog (note that
this is the more appropriate pairing to use, as the surface de nsity of radio sources is a function of
distance from the pointing center of the radio observations due to the power pattern response of
the VLA). This produced a probability of chance superpositi on of about 1.7% for objects separated
by 1 .′′5, dropping to less than 1% for sources separated by under 1 ′′.
All sources in the catalog were then analyzed to remove objec ts with low signiﬁcance of radio
detection. After correcting for the power pattern response of the VLA, the local noise around
each radio source was evaluated over a 1 .′5 box centered on the radio position. The source itself
was ﬁt using the task JMFIT, which ﬁts Gaussians to the radio e mission and returns the best
ﬁt parameters. JMFIT was instructed to correct for the power pattern and also for bandwidth
smearing. Sources for which the ﬁtted major axis had a minimu m size of zero were considered
unresolved and their peak ﬂux measurements were adopted as t heir ﬂux (e.g., Owen et al. 2005),
otherwise the ﬁtted integral ﬂux was adopted. The source ﬂux was then compared to the local
noise ﬁgure, and sources with ﬂuxes less than ﬁve times the lo cal rms were removed. In practice,
this removed 16 low signiﬁcance objects from the list of radi o sources with optical IDs.
The list of IDs was then checked by a visual inspection of the a ctual images. Radio contours
were overlaid on the optical images, and all catalog identiﬁ cations were conﬁrmed. This step also
found one radio galaxy with the morphology of a compact doubl e. The separation between the
optical galaxy position and the nearer of the two radio lobes was more than 1 .′′5, and hence would
be excluded in our radio galaxy catalog. However, using the m idpoint of the radio lobe positions
results in the source being accepted. This radio galaxy will be discussed in more detail in Section
3.4.2. The ﬁnal list is presented in Table 2 and includes 175 o bjects. The majority of these were
classiﬁed as galaxies in the SDSS photometric catalogs, alt hough including objects classiﬁed as
– 8 –
stars yielded nine detections. Of the optical IDs, 29 are inc luded among our spectroscopic database
and a further six had reported spectroscopy from other sourc es (including one object with an
SDSS photometric classiﬁcation of “star,” for which the spe ctroscopy reveals to be a quasar). This
information is included in Table 2, along with photometric r edshifts for sources without optical
spectroscopy (details on the photometric redshifts will be provided in Section 3.4.1). A histogram
of the distribution of magnitudes for the radio sources with optical counterparts is provided in
Figure 2.
3. Analysis
3.1. Cluster Dynamics from Optical Spectroscopy
There are 196 galaxy velocities presented in Table 1, plus an additional 9 targets whose spectra
suggest they are faint stars. Velocity histograms along the line of sight to A2111 are provided in
Figure 3. Using the robust statistics of Beers, Flynn, & Gebh ardt (1990), our spectroscopic data
indicate that the observed systemic velocity of the cluster (the biweight location) is 68573 ± 91
km s −1 (z = 0 . 2287) with a velocity dispersion (the biweight scale) of 889 +73
−59 km s −1. These
values are based on 95 cluster galaxies as determined using 3 σ clipping, with the galaxy velocities
corrected for measurement errors and relativistic eﬀects. B ased on these ﬁgures, the ± 3σ range of
observed velocities corresponding to the cluster is 65177 – 72014 km s −1. The biweight location
for the cluster center is 15 h39m42.s0 +34 ◦26′27′′, about 80 ′′ from the adopted X-ray center. Using
these data, we derived a virial mass of 3 . 6 × 1015 M⊙. An additional 10 galaxies with velocities
from public sources fall within the range of accepted cluste r velocities (ﬁve each from NED and the
SDSS), with a further two galaxies just below the lower veloc ity limit (see Figure 3). Six of the
seven NED velocities, including the two just below the lower velocity limit, come from Lavery &
Henry (1994) and hence may reﬂect a fairly large oﬀset from our measurements. However, including
all additional NED and SDSS velocities does not signiﬁcantl y change the cluster systemic velocity
and dispersion, yielding 68536 ± 94 km s −1 and 974 +75
−61 km s −1, respectively. The two lower velocity
galaxies are accepted as cluster members in this extended da tabase on account of their high assigned
errors of 300 km s −1.
The velocity data were subjected to a wide variety of statist ical tests designed to evaluate sub-
structure, as described in Pinkney et al. (1996) and referen ces therein. The majority of the tests
indicated no signiﬁcant substructure, although the bimoda lity hinted at in the velocity histogram
(Figure 3) did produce some marginal diﬀerences from the null hypothesis of a Gaussian veloc-
ity distribution. Substructure tests including positiona l information failed to indicate signiﬁcant
substructure with the exception of the Fourier Elongation ( FE) test (Pinkney et al. 1996). This
test compares the galaxy distribution to a circularly symme tric distribution, and its signiﬁcance
is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. None of the 1000 Mo nte Carlo runs produced a higher
FE test statistic. The elongation is not proof of substructu re, but clusters with substructure are
– 9 –
typically elongated. In particular, elongation observed i n the X-ray emission of the intracluster gas
is often viewed as evidence for non-relaxed systems as was no ted earlier in the description of prior
X-ray results for A2111. The position angle of the elongatio n in the galaxy distribution, 150 ◦± 8
measured east from north, is consistent with that found in th e X-ray analysis of Wang, Ulmer, &
Lavery (1997), 162 ◦+12
−21 (90% conﬁdence range).
To further investigate the possible bimodality in the clust er population, we used the KMM
algorithm (Ashman, Bird, & Zepf 1994). The ﬁrst application of KMM was made on the veloc-
ity data only, using the 95 cluster velocities reported in th is paper. The input velocities were
cosmologically-corrected to the cluster rest frame, and KM M was allowed to ﬁt two Gaussians with
identical dispersions to the data (i.e., the homoskedastic case). This ﬁt did largely conﬁrm the
impression of bimodality obtained from Figure 3, producing systems with mean velocities of 69177
km s −1 and 67358 km s −1, respectively, after conversion back to observed velociti es. The ﬁtted
dispersion for these two groups was 543 km s −1, and 63 galaxies were assigned to the former while
32 were assigned to the latter. The signiﬁcance of the improv ement of this two-component ﬁt over
that of a single Gaussian was fairly modest, at about 96%. The separation of the two components
was quite clean and is easily apparent in Figure 3: the trough in the velocity histogram at 68000
km s −1 is exactly where the split occurred, with higher velocity ob jects belonging to the larger
system and lower velocity objects belonging to the smaller o ne.
We also attempted to include positional information in the K MM ﬁtting. In this case, KMM
evaluates the probability for each galaxy to belong to eithe r of two components by considering how
each variable (two positional coordinates and velocity) co mpares to the means of those components.
The three variables are properly weighted by their individu al dispersions and covariances among the
variables are taken into account. Provided with the 95 clust er galaxy velocities and their positions,
KMM apportioned the galaxies very diﬀerently than it did for t he homoskedastic case. The two
ﬁtted components had similar mean values for their position s and velocities but with very diﬀerent
dispersions in these quantities. Plotting up the positions of the galaxies by ﬁtted component
revealed that KMM had taken the core of the cluster and separa ted it from its outskirts: the core
had smaller dispersions in the two positional coordinates a nd a larger dispersion in velocity. The
uncertainty in this split was reﬂected in a fairly low estima te of correct allocation of galaxies to the
“outskirt” component (73%). KMM is known to be sensitive to o utliers, so we next restricted the
input list to galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center. Thi s resulted in a very similar situation to
the homoskedastic case, with two components slightly oﬀset i n position (15 h39m48s +34◦25′19′′ and
15h39m36s +34◦26′11′′, each to within an accuracy of about an arcminute) and distin guished more
by their large separation in velocity (69212 km s −1 and 67408 km s −1 observed velocities, or about
1400 km s −1 in the cluster rest frame). The ﬁtted dispersions were 593 km s−1 and 610 km s −1,
with 38 galaxies assigned to the ﬁrst component and 28 to the s econd. The actual assignments were
very similar to those made in the homoskedastic case: only fo ur galaxies had diﬀerent assignments
in the 3D case from those made in the 1D homoskedastic KMM run. All of these had been assigned
to the ﬁrst component in the homoskedastic ﬁtting but were pl aced in the second component when

positional data were included. Velocity histograms and gal axy positions for these assignments may
be found in Figure 4. The two brightest galaxies at the cluste r center both belong to the ﬁrst
component. Treating these two components separately, we de termined virial masses of 8 . 5 × 1014
and 1 . 1 × 1015 M⊙, respectively.
3.2. Cluster Blue Fraction
The availability of accurate photometric data from the SDSS makes computation of the cluster
blue fraction a straightforward proposition. In addition, the large spectroscopic database allows
for direct testing of whether the high reported blue fractio n for A2111 is signiﬁcantly biased by
contamination from foreground and background galaxies, as one might naively expect based on the
rich line of sight evidenced in the velocity histogram of Fig ure 3.
We have emulated the original procedure of Butcher & Oemler ( 1984) in evaluating the blue
fraction for A2111. In their calculation, BO84 used galaxy c ounts with MV ≤ − 20 and a cosmology
with H0 = 50 km s −1 Mpc−1 and q0 = 0 . 1. We have used kcorrect v3.2 (Blanton et al. 2003) to
determine the appropriate k correction for an MV = − 20 E/S0 galaxy at z = 0 . 2287. The kcorrect
software also has the feature of synthesizing B V R magnitudes from the SDSS u g r i z magnitudes,
making this particularly useful for the purpose at hand. Inc luding AV = 0 . 087 (Schlegel et al. 1998),
we determined that mr = 20 . 68 corresponds to the cutoﬀ of MV = − 20. The BO84 deﬁnition of
blue was a B − V color more than 0.2 magnitudes bluer than the E/S0 galaxies i n the cluster.
For the SDSS data, this corresponds to 0.2 magnitudes in g − r. The next important step is that
of ﬁtting the color-magnitude (CM) relation in A2111, also r eferred to as the E/S0 ridgeline. For
this purpose, we have followed the procedure outlined in Lop ez-Cruz et al. (2004) and arrived at
(g − r) = 2 . 28 − 0. 047r (see Figures 5 and 6).
With these results in place, the blue fraction was determine d using the SDSS photometric
catalog of galaxies. The BO84 blue fraction was calculated i nside a radius of 4 .′1, and we found
183 galaxies with mr ≤ 20. 68 within this distance of our adopted cluster center positi on. These
183 galaxies included 45 which were 0.2 magnitudes or more bl uer than the ﬁtted CM relation.
The background was ﬁt using galaxies at large radial separat ions from the cluster center where the
galaxy surface density had fallen to a constant value. This p roduced ﬁnal numbers of 20.1 blue
counts and 134.7 total counts, or fb = 0 . 15 ± 0. 03 (see Figure 6). This is in excellent agreement
with the original BO84 estimate of fb = 0 . 16 ± 0. 03. The lower number of total counts relative to
the BO84 value (134.7 compared to 155) was also noted by Laver y & Henry (1986), who opted to
reduce their magnitude limit to reproduce the net counts of B O84.
The spectroscopic observations conﬁrm this high blue fract ion in A2111. There are available
redshifts for 44 galaxies in the above analysis, 34 of which a re for “red” galaxies and 10 of which
are for “blue” galaxies. The majority of each prove to be clus ter members (33 of 34 red galaxies,
9 of 10 blue). Using these fractions to correct the total coun ts for foreground and background
– 11 –
contamination yields fb = 0 . 23 ± 0. 03.
We have similarly calculated blue fractions for galaxies wi th Mr ≤ − 20 under the WMAP
cosmology within a radius of 2 Mpc (9 .′1). In this case, there were 466 net galaxy counts of which
156 were bluer than the cluster CM relation. The resulting fr action using backgrounds estimated
from the photometry data was fb = 0 . 17 ± 0. 03. The spectroscopy data include 64 red galaxies
within this area, 56 of which are cluster members. 2 For the blue galaxies, these numbers are 42 and
18, respectively. The resulting blue fraction using spectr oscopic data to correct for the background
is fb = 0 . 20 ± 0. 03.
3.3. Spectroscopic Classiﬁcations
The galaxies with optical spectra were also classiﬁed using the “MORPHS” scheme (Dressler et
al. 1999; Poggianti et al. 1999). This is based primarily on t wo spectral features, the [O ii] λ3727 line
in emission and the H δ λ 4102 line in absorption. Passive galaxies, deﬁned as those l acking emission
lines, are designated “k” and are further classiﬁed on the ba sis of their H δ absorption lines: those
with weak H δ are simply “k” galaxies, while strong H δ absorption caused by a large population
of young A stars produces a “k+a” classiﬁcation (or if especi ally strong, “a+k”). These k+a and
a+k galaxies are often referred to as post-starburst or “E+A ” galaxies (Dressler & Gunn 1983).
The presence of [O ii] in emission indicates an active galaxy, with such galaxies being designated
“e()” where the parenthetical value takes one of four possib le options. If examination of line widths
and other lines such as [O iii] indicate an AGN, the galaxy is classiﬁed as “e(n).” Galaxie s with
spectra representative of continuous star formation histo ries evidenced by moderate [O ii] emission
and at most slight H δ absorption are classiﬁed “e(c),” while those with unusuall y strong [O ii]
emission representative of a current starburst are classiﬁ ed “e(b).” Finally, star forming galaxies
with strong H δ absorption are classiﬁed “e(a).” This type of spectrum appe ars to arise in dusty
starburst galaxies (Poggianti et al. 1999).
Our classiﬁcations were made within IRAF through visual ins pection of the spectra and ﬁtting
Gaussians to the appropriate lines. This does imply a certai n degree of subjectivity, as the S/N of
the spectra are only moderate in the vicinity of H δ (a mean of about 12 per resolution element, with
a range from 8 to 18) and ﬁtted equivalent widths are inﬂuence d by our assumed continuum levels.
However, the objective of making the assigments is to assess trends in the star formation history of
the cluster galaxies as an overall population. Thus, such is sues should have minimal eﬀects. Among
our 95 cluster galaxies with Hydra spectra, we identiﬁed 63 g alaxies of type k, 5 k+a, 14 e(a), 12
e(c), and 1 e(n). The classiﬁcations are presented in Table 3 and example spectra are presented in
Figure 7, with both the lowest and highest S/N spectrum withi n the major classes plotted. The
2Since the need for the spectroscopy is simply to indicate clu ster membership, we include NED and SDSS velocities
in this analysis. This explains the apparent discrepancy in numbers of cluster galaxies within 2 Mpc used for this
analysis with that done for the cluster dynamics.
– 12 –
availability of the SDSS spectroscopy allows classiﬁcatio n of another ﬁve cluster galaxies, all of
which are of type k. That all the galaxies with SDSS spectra ar e type k is to be expected, as the
faint limit of the SDSS main galaxy sample is mr = 17 . 77 (Strauss et al. 2002) which corresponds
to Mr = − 22. 9 for an elliptical in A2111. Some ellipticals fainter than t his apparent magnitude
limit have SDSS spectra through their selection in the SDSS l uminous red galaxy (LRG) sample
(Eisenstein et al. 2001).
3.4. Characterizing the Radio Galaxies
3.4.1. Cluster Radio Galaxies
Table 4 includes the derived quantities for the 14 radio gala xies whose velocities place them
within A2111. The majority of these (9) have optical spectra which indicate their radio emission
arises from active star formation. The remaining ﬁve radio g alaxies include three passive or k type
galaxies, one emission line AGN, and one galaxy whose veloci ty was reported in Morrison et al.
(2003). This last galaxy is presumably of type k on the basis o f its optical color. The AGN is
among the fainter cluster galaxies with an obtained spectru m ( MR = − 21. 3) and is located in a
tight grouping of galaxies nearly 2 Mpc to the south of the clu ster center.
Radio luminosities for the cluster galaxies were determine d using the WMAP cosmology and
assuming a spectral index of 0.7 in performing the k correcti on (i.e., Sν ∝ ν−0. 7). There are
no cluster galaxies with extended radio morphologies and lu minosities representative of Fanaroﬀ
& Riley (1974) class sources. Star formation rates for the ac tive galaxies were derived using the
relationship in Yun, Reddy, & Condon (2001), which is based o n the local far-infrared (FIR) density
and the strong correlation between radio and FIR emission in star-forming galaxies. Underlying
assumptions in the FIR-derived SFR, and hence the radio one, are a Salpeter initial mass function
with mass limits of 0.1 and 100 M ⊙. With this conversion, the sensitivity limit of the radio
observations translates to about 5.5 M ⊙ year−1 (8.5 M ⊙ year−1 in the noisier regions within 2 Mpc
of the cluster center). Thus, the radio observations select the more vigorously star-forming galaxies
in the cluster and hence we detect only 6 of the 15 spectroscop ically-identiﬁed e(a) galaxies and 3 of
the 12 e(c) galaxies. Additionally, many of the non-detecte d emission line galaxies lie farther from
the cluster center where the sensitivity of the radio observ ations are lower. Of the 9 undetected
e(a) galaxies, 5 lie over 2 Mpc from the cluster center includ ing one which is outside the region
covered by the radio images. Similarly, 7 of the 9 undetected e(c) galaxies are greater than 2 Mpc
from the cluster center.
An additional use of the kcorrect software is that it can be used to determine photometric
redshifts ( zphot). These are especially useful for determining the properti es of the radio galaxies
without available spectra, and are presented for such cases in Table 2. The 1 σ error in these values,
determined by comparison of zphot calculated for all galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts p resented
in Table 1, is 0.044 (after 5 sigma clipping and the 1 + z correction). From this information we
– 13 –
are also able to identify those radio galaxies without optic al spectra which are probable cluster
members. There are 25 possible cluster radio galaxies withi n 2 Mpc of the cluster center, of which
8 are photometrically classiﬁed as “blue” with the remainin g 17 being “red.” Allowing a ± 3σ
range, galaxies with 0 . 10 ≤ zphot ≤ 0. 36 are potential cluster members and we ﬁnd that 7 of the
8 blue galaxies meet this criterion while 5 of the 17 red galax ies do. These 12 potential cluster
radio galaxies are presented in Table 5 along with their abso lute quantities calculated under the
assumption of cluster membership. Most are fairly faint opt ically, providing a simple explanation
for their exclusion in our spectroscopy observations.
3.4.2. Foreground and Background Radio Galaxies
Radio galaxies not located within the cluster are useful in o ther investigations. The more pow-
erful radio galaxies, with L1. 4 ≳ 1023 W Hz −1, are generally found in cluster or group environments.
This is particularly true for sources with FR1 morphologies (Fanaroﬀ & Riley 1974), which have
twin jets of radio emission which fade with distance from the host galaxy (“edge darkened”). The
bright radio nature of these types of radio galaxies makes th em eﬃcient signposts to the presence
of galaxy clusters and groups out to high redshifts (e.g., Bl anton et al. 2001; Venemans et al. 2002).
There are 21 radio galaxies with optical spectra indicating they lie in the foreground or back-
ground. The properties of these galaxies are provided in Tab le 6. Distances, and hence absolute
quantities, are based directly on the measured redshifts; p ossible peculiar motions of galaxies in
clusters are unaccounted. Based on their optical spectra an d radio luminosities, most of the galax-
ies appear to be powered by star formation. The two highest re dshift sources, with z = 0 . 5512 and
z = 0 . 8718, are quasars with spectra taken from the SDSS DR4. The MO RPHS classiﬁcations for
foreground and background galaxies are often more uncertai n on account of the wavelength cover-
age of the spectra having been optimized for cluster galaxie s. Nevertheless, we provide MORPHS
classes for the non-cluster radio galaxies in Table 6 with ﬂa gs noting where classes are uncertain
due to wavelength coverage or signal-to-noise issues.
Two foreground galaxies are associated with powerful radio sources and hence are likely markers
for poor groups. The galaxy J154125+342830 has the twin jet r adio morphology of an FR1 and is
presented in Figure 8. Its redshift is z = 0 . 1842, producing a radio luminosity of 9 . 1 × 1023 W Hz −1
(again assuming α = 0 . 7 for the k correction). Its color and optical spectrum are ty pical of a massive
elliptical galaxy as would be expected based on its radio pro perties. Similarly, J154055+343015 at
z = 0 . 1942 has a radio luminosity of 1 . 6 × 1024 W Hz −1 and the optical spectrum of an elliptical
galaxy (although with slight measured [N ii] and [S ii]). Its location 16 .′1 from the pointing center of
the radio observations means it suﬀers from smearing eﬀects an d consequently its radio morphology
is not easily described, although clearly is compact. It is a t best marginally resolved by FIRST
(Becker, White, & Helfand 1995), with a deconvolved major ax is of 1 .′′6 and a ﬂux measurement
of 15.34 mJy, consistent with the measured ﬂux from our obser vations. Neither galaxy has any
counterparts within 3000 km s −1 and 1 Mpc projected separation in Table 1.
– 14 –
Although it lacks an optical spectrum, J154041+341837 is an interesting extended radio source.
This is the compact double noted in Section 2.3.2, and may be s een in Figure 9. Its photometric
redshift is 0.50. In addition to the two main lobes of radio em ission, there is diﬀuse emission to
the southeast which appears to connect to the southeast lobe . Including this diﬀuse emission the
system ﬂux is 19.8 ± 0.5 mJy, equivalent to 1 . 7 × 1025 W Hz −1. Without the diﬀuse emission, the
radio ﬂux is still 10.3 ± 0.2 mJy or a luminosity of 8 . 7 × 1024 W Hz −1. These values are consistent
with the expectations for radio sources with compact double morphologies at the assumed redshift.
4. Discussion
The objective of our study was to characterize the galaxy pop ulation of A2111 and investigate
any possible connection it has with the dynamical state of th e cluster. We shall turn ﬁrst to a
discussion of the overall cluster dynamics and then investi gate the active galaxy populations.
4.1. Dynamical Assessment of A2111: Evidence for a Cluster Merger?
The dynamical assessment made from our measured velocities is only suggestive of A2111 rep-
resenting a cluster merger. Based on our 95 cluster galaxies , few statistical tests indicate signiﬁcant
substructure consistent with a merger scenario. The tests p erformed exclusively on velocity (i.e.,
the “ROSTAT” package of Beers, Flynn, & Gebhardt 1990) produ ced a few results indicating a
more kurtotic velocity distribution than would be expected should the true velocity distribution be
a Gaussian, yet these were only signiﬁcant at around the 90% c onﬁdence level. Application of the
KMM algorithm did indicate that the velocities were better ﬁ t by a pair of Gaussians, as might
result should A2111 be two separate clusters in the process o f merging. However, the signiﬁcance of
the improvement of this ﬁt over a single Gaussian was only a mo dest 96%. Inclusion of positional
information did little to change this interpretation, as al l but two of the 2D and 3D tests described
in Pinkney et al. (1996) failed to indicate signiﬁcant subst ructure at even the 90% conﬁdence level.
For one of these two, the ∆ test (Dressler & Shectman 1988), th e marginal signiﬁcance (98 of
1000 Monte Carlo shuﬄes of the velocity data while holding th e positions ﬁxed produced higher
∆ statistics) is likely not related to substructure so much a s sampling. Restricting the analysis
to galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center, the signﬁcanc e declines to about 75% (255 of 1000
MC runs with higher ∆). The ∆ test uses nearest neighbors to id entify local deviations from the
overall systemic velocity or dispersion. Much of the higher ∆ for the full sample results from the
lower velocity dispersion of galaxies at the periphery of th e cluster, which is expected for relaxed
systems. The 66 galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center ha ve σv = 951 +96
−74 km s −1, while the
29 outside this radial limit have σv = 711 +118
−79 km s −1.
It is interesting, however, that the one signiﬁcant substru cture test matches so well with the
X-ray data. The Fourier Elongation (FE) test yielded highly signiﬁcant evidence for an elongated
– 15 –
galaxy distribution, with none of 1000 MC simulations produ cing a stronger signature of elongation.
This result was unchanged when only galaxies within 2 Mpc of t he cluster center were considered
(in this case, 1 of 1000 MC runs had higher FE). As noted earlie r, the derived position angle
of the galaxy distribution is consistent with the large-sca le X-ray emission. This alignment was
noted by Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997), along with its consist ency to the alignment of the two
brightest galaxies at the cluster core. This overall impres sion may be seen in Figure 10 which
depicts the R-band optical image with overlaid contours of the X-ray emis sion from the ROSAT
PSPC observation. Comparison with the galaxy distribution s from the KMM analysis (Figure 4)
suggests a connection between the extension of the X-ray emi ssion to the northwest of the cluster
center and the second ﬁtted group.
Are these results consistent with a head-on cluster merger, the dynamical assessment advocated
by Wang, Ulmer, & Lavery (1997) and later Henriksen, Wang, & U lmer (1999)? The merger
interpretation of the X-ray data was based on the asymmetric X-ray morphology which leads to
shifts in the ﬁtted centroid and ellipticity with scale, alo ng with the presence of a higher temperature
core. These results are consistent with hydro/N-body simul ations after the subcluster has passed
through the core of the primary cluster (Roettiger, Burns, & Loken 1993). The simulations of
Pinkney et al. (1996) indicate that substructure tests perf ormed exclusively on velocities generally
do not produce signiﬁcant results within 2 Gyr of the time whe n the cores of merging clusters
are coincident, provided the diﬀerence between the merger ax is and the line of sight is greater
than about 30 ◦. Were the diﬀerence between the viewing angle and the merger a xis smaller than
this amount, the velocity data would almost certainly produ ce signiﬁcant deviations from the null
hypothesis of a single Gaussian velocity distribution. Fol ding in the results of the KMM analysis
that the two possible merging partners have nearly equal dis persion but are separated in velocity by
∼ 1400 km s −1, the substructure tests would argue for the system being vie wed shortly after core
passage. This same description of the merger timing and geom etry can be consistent with the tests
which include positional information. The FE statistic is q uite good at times near core passage,
provided the system is not viewed along the merger axis (i.e. , the same constraint resulting from
the lack of signiﬁcant tests based exclusively on velocitie s). The remaining tests generally do not
produce signiﬁcant results shortly after core passage, wit h the possible exception of the ∆ test. In
summary, while the substructure tests on the galaxy positio n and velocity data do not themselves
provide strong evidence for a cluster merger, they are consi stent with the interpretation of the X-ray
data that a head-on cluster merger has occurred recently pro vided that the merger axis is ≳ 30◦
diﬀerent from the line of sight. Finally, we note that the merg ing partners implied by the KMM
ﬁt meet the Newtonian condition for a bound system if the diﬀer ence between the merger axis and
the line of sight is between 5 ◦ and 73 ◦. Thus, the X-ray and optical data may be explained by a
cluster-cluster merger provided the viewing angle is betwe en about 30 ◦ and 70 ◦ from the merger
axis and the system is seen near the time when the cores of the p rogenitor clusters are coincident.

4.2. Active Galaxies in A2111: Colors, Spectra, and Radio Properties
The SDSS photometric data and our spectroscopy conﬁrm the hi gh blue fraction for A2111,
indentifying it as an active cluster. Similarly, the blue ga laxies do appear to be a dynamically
young population with a higher velocity dispersion than tha t of the red galaxy population. The
velocity dispersion of the red galaxies from our spectrosco pic observations (72 members) is 807 +77
−60
km s −1 whereas for the blue galaxies (23 members) it is 1128 +217
−138 km s −1, a diﬀerence signiﬁcant
at just over 2 σ. This general result is unchanged if we consider only those g alaxies within 2 Mpc,
and suggests that the blue galaxies are more representative of an infalling population which has
not virialized. Previous Butcher-Oemler studies have note d the same general eﬀect (e.g., Lavery &
Henry 1994, and references therein).
The interpretation of the blue galaxies as active galaxies w hich represent the infalling popula-
tion does not translate simply to the spectroscopic classiﬁ cations of the galaxies. In fact, there is
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the velocity dispersion of t he passive, non-emission line galaxies
compared to the emission line galaxies. The former have a vel ocity dispersion of 860 +85
−66 km s −1
while the latter have a velocity dispersion of 737 +128
−84 km s −1. In this case, the eﬀect of including
only galaxies within 2 Mpc of the cluster center is larger as t he emission line galaxies are more
likely to be located at greater clustercentric distance whe re the local velocity dispersion is lower.
There are 27 total emission line galaxies, of which 14 lie out side 2 Mpc. Using only galaxies within
2 Mpc, the velocity dispersion of the emission line galaxies rises to 1038 +298
−160 km s −1, although this
is still consistent with the dispersion of the non-emission line galaxies.
Of course, one reason for any diﬀerences in the calculated dis persions is that the simple corre-
spondence of a blue galaxy being an emission line galaxy is of ten false. Of the 27 cluster emission
line galaxies, eight have colors consistent with the cluste r red sequence. One of these is the AGN
J153945.7+341625, while the other seven have spectra of sta r-forming galaxies. Star-forming galax-
ies with colors consistent with a cluster’s red sequence hav e been identiﬁed previously by several
authors (Homeier et al. 2005; Wolf, Gray, & Meisenheimer 200 5). There are also exceptions on the
converse side, with four non-emission line galaxies having blue colors. Two of these are k+a galax-
ies, J153938.7+342639 and J153941.9+342420, where the blu e color is consistent with the recent
burst of star formation implied by the A star features in the g alaxies’ spectra (the strong Balmer
absorption and blue color for these particular galaxies are also noted in Lavery & Henry 1994).
These two galaxies also lie very close to the center of the clu ster, with projected clustercentric
distances of 360 and 170 kpc. The remaining two passive clust er galaxies with blue colors are also
located near the cluster center (about 0.6 and 1.1 Mpc). Alth ough not detected by the radio data,
they are potentially analogs to the cluster star-forming ga laxies without notable emission lines in
the blue portion of their spectra identiﬁed in Miller & 0wen ( 2002).
The spectral classiﬁcations of the galaxies in combination with the radio data do indicate
evidence for starburst activity in member galaxies, with th e strong suggestion that dust extinction
is important. Although our MORPHS classiﬁcations of cluste r galaxies include no e(b) galaxies,
– 17 –
such types of objects are generally rare in clusters. Of the t en clusters studied by Dressler et al.
(1999), most have only 0 to 2 such galaxies. Furthermore, gal axies with e(b) spectra are almost
always intrinsically fairly faint (Poggianti et al. 1999) a nd our spectroscopy is primarily of brighter
cluster galaxies (with MR ≲ − 21. 5). This is compounded by our radio detection limit, which wo uld
require relatively high SFR for such galaxies. Even so, ther e may be examples of e(b) galaxies
among the radio galaxies with photometric redshifts consis tent with cluster membership (Table 5),
as these were typically missed by our spectroscopy on accoun t of their fainter magnitudes. There
are, however, 14 e(a) galaxies identiﬁed in A2111, includin g six associated with radio emission.
Models and nearby examples of galaxies with such spectra ind icate that e(a) galaxies are dusty
starbursts, where emission line regions face larger extinc tion than the more dispersed young star
(∼ A) population (e.g., Poggianti et al. 1999; Shioya, Bekki, & Couch 2001). The e(a) galaxies in
A2111 include the strongest cluster radio galaxy, J153949. 3+342640, an Sc galaxy (morphology
from Fasano et al. 2000) in the cluster core with L1. 4 = 9 . 3 × 1022 W Hz −1. This translates to a
SFR of over 55 M ⊙ year−1. Finally, two of the three radio-detected e(c) cluster gala xies have colors
which place them along the cluster red sequence. If these are also dusty star-forming galaxies as
suggested by Wolf, Gray, & Meisenheimer (2005), their radio emission implies SFRs of 17 and 27
M⊙ year−1.
Smail et al. (1999) examined the cluster A851 and identiﬁed s everal k+a galaxies with radio
emission, concluding that these were likely highly dust-en shrouded starbursts. Such spectra are
essentially an extreme manifestation of the e(a) class, in w hich dust extinction has removed even
the [O ii] line. The rms sensitivity of the Smail et al. (1999) data cor responds to a 5 σ limit of 14.2
M⊙ year−1, meaning k+a galaxies in A2111 with comparable SFR would be d etected. None of the
ﬁve k+a galaxies in our spectroscopic data are formal radio d etections, however we note that one is
identiﬁed with low signiﬁcance. The k+a galaxy J153938.7+3 42639 is resolved and has an integral
ﬂux of 99 ± 41 µJy and a local noise of 13 µJy, however it did not enter our catalog of possible
radio sources as its peak ﬂux was only 40 µJy. The integral ﬂux of this galaxy corresponds to a
SFR of 8.4 M ⊙ year−1. It is one of the two blue k+a galaxies near the cluster core.
Are such ﬁndings on star formation in A2111 unusual relative to other clusters? First, we
compare the populations in the various spectroscopic class es with those of the ten clusters with
0. 37 ≤ z ≤ 0. 56 used in the MORPHS study. In general, the fraction of star- forming galaxies is
consistent with the overall results of the MORPHS study. We ﬁ nd that 0.13 ± 0.03 of the A2111
galaxies have e(c) spectra, whereas the fraction for this cl ass in the MORPHS study was 0.14 ± 0.02.
Similarly, A2111 has an e(a) fraction of 0.15 ± 0.04 compared to the MORPHS result of 0.11 ± 0.02.
The possible excess in the e(a) population is oﬀset by the note d lack of e(b) galaxies in A2111,
which make up 0.05 ± 0.01 of the MORPHS sample. Our A2111 spectroscopy are more di screpant
with the MORPHS results when we consider passive galaxies. I n particular, we ﬁnd relatively more
k type galaxies (0 . 67 ± 0. 05 compared to 0 . 48 ± 0. 04) at the expense of k+a galaxies (0 . 05 ± 0. 02
compared to 0 . 21± 0. 02). In part, some of these minor diﬀerences may be caused by sa mpling as our
spectroscopic sampling is ≈ 0. 5 magnitude less deep than the MORPHS. Thus, we are less likel y to
– 18 –
observe the fainter galaxies (especially e(b) galaxies) an d will hence have a higher fraction of the
brighter spectroscopic classes (i.e., the k galaxies). We d o, however, sample a larger physical area
than the MORPHS. Based on the radial distributions of the var ious spectroscopic classes, we would
expect this to increase the relative numbers of active galax ies as these are less concentrated in the
cluster cores. These arguments do not apply to the apparent d eﬁcit in k+a galaxies, however. In
the MORPHS work, such spectral types are nearly as bright as t he k galaxies and only slightly less
centrally concentrated. Only one of the seven MORPHS cluste rs (Cl1447+23) has a k+a fraction
which is not signiﬁcantly (i.e., at 2 σ) greater than that of A2111. In a general sense, with the
exception of the k+a galaxies, the relative fractions of the various spectral classes indicate that
despite its lower redshift A2111 has active galaxy populati ons typical of higher redshift clusters.
Second, we can qualitatively compare the radio galaxy popul ation of A2111 with other clusters
studied by radio observations. If we restrict the compariso n to galaxies within 2 Mpc of cluster
centers and with L1. 4 ≥ 1. 4 × 1022 W Hz −1 (i.e., 5 σ detections in the noisier region of our data),
there are 11 spectroscopically conﬁrmed cluster radio gala xies in A2111 plus an additional 10
with photometric redshifts suggestive of cluster membersh ip. Inclusion of the photometric redshift
sources is probably wise, since the clusters to which we draw comparisons are generally studied
down to fainter optical limits. Working in the opposite dire ction is the known correlation that
optically faint galaxies are not often associated with radi o sources at luminosities above our noted
limit (e.g., Miller & 0wen 2002). In the highly active cluste r A2125 at the comparable redshift of
z = 0 . 2465, there are 43 galaxies within 2 Mpc and with L1. 4 ≥ 1. 4 × 1022 W Hz −1 (Owen et al.
2005). When factoring in the apparently lower richness of A2 125 relative to A2111 ( N30 values
of 62 and 155, respectively, from Butcher & Oemler 1984), it i s clear that A2111 is less active.
At lower redshift, the active cluster A2255 ( z = 0 . 0800) has 15 radio galaxies meeting the above
criteria (Miller & Owen 2003). Only ﬁve of these are powered b y star formation, with four classiﬁed
as e(c) and one as e(a). Still, this is about twice the radio ga laxy population of the comparable
richness Coma cluster.
One possible diﬀerence of A2111 from other clusters with larg e active galaxy populations
identiﬁed is in its lack of powerful radio AGN, in particular the sources with extended radio mor-
phologies and high luminosities. In fact, there are no FR1 or FR2 type sources in A2111, which is
fairly unusual for a rich cluster of galaxies. A851 is the MOR PHS cluster best-studied in the radio
(Morrison et al. 2005), and it also has a large population of r adio-detected star-forming galaxies
without any FR1 or FR2 galaxies. Venturi et al. (2000) sugges t that cluster mergers may switch
oﬀ powerful radio galaxies, based on an apparent lack of such objects in A3558. In contrast, the
above mentioned A2255 has six: three head-tail radio galaxi es and a strong compact double near
the cluster core, plus a wide-angle tail and narrow-angle ta il each about 1.5 Mpc from the cluster
center.
Finally, we have investigated whether there were any signiﬁ cant diﬀerences in the galaxy pop-
ulations between the two components identiﬁed by the KMM ana lysis. Such a diﬀerence might
result should one component be associated with an active pop ulation merging with a more quies-
– 19 –
cent population describing the main cluster. We tested the b lue fractions, emission line fractions,
and radio galaxy fractions and found no statistical diﬀerenc e in these quantities between the two
ﬁtted components (for both the ﬁts found using only velocity data and those found using positions
as well as velocities). Although not statistically signiﬁc ant, we note that the second component
in the KMM ﬁt using a radial cutoﬀ of 2 Mpc and both positional a nd velocity data included
both blue k+a galaxies. The ﬁve emission line galaxies assig ned to this component were all of the
e(a) spectral class and were also all blue. The X-ray data pro vide circumstantial evidence that this
second ﬁtted component is associated with the more diﬀuse tra il of X-ray emission to the northwest
of the cluster center (Figures 4 and 10).
5. Conclusions
We have presented an in-depth analysis of the Butcher-Oemle r cluster A2111. This analysis
was based on optical spectroscopy providing 196 galaxy spec tra, plus multicolor optical imaging
from the SDSS and a deep VLA radio continuum image. This combi nation has been extremely
eﬀective in providing a coherent picture of the situation in t his cluster.
The optical spectroscopy included 95 conﬁrmed cluster memb ers that allowed us to make a
detailed dynamical analysis of the cluster. A large number o f statistical tests of substructure were
applied, producing only one signiﬁcant result: the galaxy d istribution in A2111 is elongated, with
the position angle consistent with that determined from pri or X-ray analysis. The velocity data
thereby do not themselves provide signiﬁcant evidence for A 2111 being a cluster merger, however
they are consistent with this dynamical assessment provide d the system is viewed near the time
when the cores of the two progenitor clusters have crossed. I n addition, the statistical tests required
that the viewing angle is ≳ 30◦ diﬀerent from the merger axis.
With the SDSS data and our spectroscopy we have conﬁrmed the h igh blue fraction for A2111.
Based on the photometry data alone and using the same apertur e as Butcher & Oemler (1984),
we derived a blue fraction of fb = 0 . 15 ± 0. 03. Redshifts are available for 44 of the galaxies that
entered this analysis, which revealed that 9 of 10 blue galax ies and 33 of 34 red galaxies are cluster
members. Using these ﬁgures to account for the background pr oduced fb = 0 . 23 ± 0. 03, further
strengthening A2111’s description as a high blue fraction c luster.
The optical spectroscopy and radio data reveal a substantia l population of dusty starbursts
within the cluster. The sensitivity of the radio data imply t hat galaxies with SFR as low as 5.5
M⊙ yr−1 are detected, and we identiﬁed 9 radio galaxies with spectra indicative of star formation
from our spectroscopy database. Most of these have “e(a)” ty pe spectra, arguing that they are
dusty starbursts. Indeed, the strongest radio source in the cluster is of this variety and has a radio
SFR of 55 M ⊙ yr−1. In addition to the radio galaxies with attendant spectrosc opy, we identiﬁed
12 galaxies whose photometric redshifts are consistent wit h their being cluster members. Over half
of these had blue colors representative of starbursts. Phot ometric redshifts were presented for all
– 20 –
SDSS objects associated with radio emission, in hope that th ey will prove useful in other studies.
In total, these results are consistent with the hypothesis t hat dynamically-active clusters are
associated with more active member galaxies than relaxed cl usters.

aA consistent velocity was found for this galaxy via cross cor -
relation of absorption features with velocity standards.
bA velocity for this galaxy is also reported in NED.
cA velocity for this galaxy is also in the SDSS DR4.
Note. — All reported velocities are heliocentric. When a ve-
locity has been determined on the basis of emission lines, th ese
lines are noted in the “Lines” column. If identiﬁed lines are oﬀ-
set by parentheses, they were not used to determine the repor ted
velocity but were found to be consistent with that velocity. Note
that [O iii] usually refers to the λ5007 line, but sometimes also
includes the λ4959 line. Similarly, [N ii] is usually the λ6584 line
but may also include the λ6548 line and [S ii] may be either or
both of λ6717 and λ6731.

Note. — SN is the signal-to-noise ratio per resolution eleme nt
in the vicinity of H δ. Color is simply R for consistent with red
sequence, B if blue in BO84 sense (i.e., ∆( g − r) ≤ − 0. 2). Distance
is in Mpc from cluster center. Radio is N for non-detected, D f or
detected and in Table 4, and O for outside surveyed area.

aBased on the color and/or optical spectrum, the galaxy is lik ely to be an AGN and
hence the SFR is an upper limit due to inclusion of radio emiss ion associated with the
active nucleus.
bNoisy spectrum, so H δ absorption may be insuﬃcient for e(a) classiﬁcation.
cSeyfert 2 spectrum.
dVelocity reported in Morrison et al. (2003).
Note. — Apparent R magnitudes were estimated from the SDSS u g r i z magnitudes
using the observed redshifts and kcorrect software (Blanton et al. 2003), with the abso-
lute R magnitudes based on DL = 1129 Mpc, z = 0 . 2287, and AR = 0 . 07. ∆( g − r) is
color relative to the cluster CM relation. Values less than - 0.2 are thus considered blue
in the Butcher-Oemler sense. The radio luminosities were ca lculated assuming a spectral
index of 0.7.

Note. — The photometric redshifts and apparent R magnitudes were deter-
mined using the SDSS u g r i z magnitudes and kcorrect software (Blanton et
al. 2003). The absolute R magnitudes and radio luminosities were then calcu-
lated as in Table 4 assuming the galaxies were cluster member s with z = 0 . 2287
and DL = 1129 Mpc. ∆( g − r) is the color relative to the cluster CM relation.
Values less than -0.2 are thus considered blue in the Butcher -Oemler sense.

eFormally an e(c) on basis of EW([O ii])< 40, but EW(H α +[Nii])> 100

f Hβ is present but contaminated by telluric 5577 line, [O ii] and H α
outside wavelength coverage. [O iii] emission is very slight and the rest
frame color is blue, so tentative classiﬁcation of e(c) is as signed.

hSpectral wavelength coverage does not include H δ. The classiﬁcation
is based on other Balmer lines.
iPossibly a weak AGN, as the spectrum includes weak [O ii] and [O iii],
