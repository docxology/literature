In this short communication we investigate an information theoretic analogue of the classic two
masses on spring system, arising from a physical interpretation of Friston’s free energy principle in
the theory of learning in a system of agents. Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds,
we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy
function defined in terms of stress on the agents’ beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian)
produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function
is defined using the Jeffrey’s divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear
spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically
to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information
theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed
target is a more stable approach to altering an agent’s belief than providing a slowly changing belief
state that approaches the target.
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The free energy principle was developed by Friston,
Kilner and Harrison [1] as a thermodynamically in-
spired model of perception that presupposes the brain
minimizes surprise (entropy) by maintaining an inter-
nal model of reality that is updated regularly through
sensory input. Connections between this work, statis-
tical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics have been sub-
sequently studied by Friston and others [2–12] and ex-
tended to more generic biological systems [13] as well as
machine learning contexts [14]. More recently, Hein et
al. [15] showed that the principle of “surprise minimiza-
tion” allows for collective behavior to arise in complex
interacting systems.
In this short communication, we rephrase the free en-
ergy principle in terms of free entropy, which arises natu-
rally from the information geometry of the Fisher metric
[16–18]. This quantity and the corresponding techniques
from information geometry have been used extensively in
statistical physics [19–27].
Using techniques from classical mechanics on mani-
folds, we derive an alternative to the DeGroot averaging
model (see e.g., [28–30]), which has similar structure and
properties but emerges naturally from our information
theoretic variation of the free energy principle as a classi-
cal mass/spring system, further supporting the hypoth-
esis that “surprise minimization” can lead to collective
behavior [15]. In this derivation, a statistical divergence
replaces the classical square distance in the Hooke spring
potential. Convergence to an opinion is ensured by the
inclusion of a dissipative “dashpot” term [31, 32] and
consensus is determined by the spring constants. While
opinion dynamics have been studied extensively [33–48]
along with the related disciplines of flocking and con-
sensus [30, 33, 34, 49–56], we believe this is the first

derivation of these dynamics from the free energy prin-
ciple or the corresponding “minimum surprise principle”
rephrased as a free entropy minimization.
Let p(x|η) be a probability distribution parameter-
ized by η. For two distributions p(x|η) and q(x|η), the
Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence is given by,
DKL(p|q) =
Z
X
p(x|η) log
p(x|η)
q(x|η)

dx. (1)
It is straightforward to see that the KL-divergence is nei-
ther symmetric nor does it satisfy any version of the tri-
angle inequality [57]. Likewise, the quadratic form of the
Fisher metric is defined componentwise as,
gjk(η) =
Z
X
∂ log [p(x|η)]
∂xj
∂ log [p(x|η)]
∂xk
p(x|η) dx.
In addition to the usual Riemannian geodesic distance,
statistical manifolds admit divergences, which are locally
consistent with the Fisher metric and yield affine con-
nections [57, 58], but are themselves not true distances.
The KL-divergence, already introduced, is one such di-
vergence. In particular, we can locally write,
DKL (p(x|η)|p(x|η0)) =
X
j,k
1
2gjk(η0)∆ηj∆ηk+O(∥∆η∥3),
showing the relationship between the metric and the di-
vergence [57]. In this communication we use the Fisher
metric to measure distance and length locally, while the
KL-divergence will play the role of a global Mahalanobis
distance.
Using the kinetic energy, computed using the Fisher
metric, we can form a Lagrangian
L(η, ˙η) =
X
j,k

2gjk(η) ˙ηj ˙ηk − V (η), (2)
where V is a potential function, to be defined in context.

Let ∆n−1 be the n−1 dimensional unit simplex embed-
ded in Rn. The categorical distribution with parameters
q1, . . . , qn−1 is the vector (q0, . . . , qn−1) ∈ ∆n−1, where
q0 = 1 −

j
qj. (3)
In this case, the metric tensor can be computed explicitly
as gij = δij/qi + 1/q0, where 1 ≤ i, j≤ n − 1.
II. OPINION DYNAMICS AS A NONLINEAR
SPRING SYSTEM
Consider the two outcome (Bernoulli) case and letq1 =
q and q0 = 1 − q. Then the kinetic energy is,
T(q) = m
2
˙q2
q(1 − q). (4)
Here, m is a mass term that could be unitized.
For the remainder of this paper, we consider the setting
where q is the parameter in a Bernoulli random variable
representing an agent’s belief about a certain outcome
or opinion about a certain bivalent topic. If q′ ∈ (0, 1)
is a fixed belief point (i.e., an external reference point)
then the KL-divergence yields an information theoretic
“squared distance” from q to q′ as,
D(q, q′) = q log
 q
q′

+ (1 − q) log
 1 − q
1 − q′

.
In this scenario q′ is treated as a prior belief and q is
treated as a posterior belief. Mimicking the potential
energy for a spring, and using Eq. (2) and Eq. (4), the
Lagrangian written in terms of q, ˙q, and q′ is,
L(q, q′) = m
2
˙q2
q(1 − q) − k
2 D(q, q′),
where we assume (for now) that q′ represents a fixed
Bernoulli distribution and k is a notional spring constant.
This has corresponding Hamiltonian,
H(q, p) = q(1 − q)
2m p2 + k
2 D(q, q′),
where,
∂L
∂ ˙q = p = m ˙q
q(1 − q),
is the conjugate momentum variable. Expanding to sec-
ond order around q = q′ = 1
2 , H(q, p) has form,
H(q, p) = q(1 − q)
2m p2 + k(q − q′)2 + O(q3),
showing that this is just a nonlinear spring potential.
Using the foregoing analysis, we can derive a variant of
the DeGroot dynamics [29, 30, 59]. As before, let qi be
the parameter in a Bernoulli random variable represent-
ing an agent’s belief about a certain outcome or opinion
about a certain bivalent topic. Let kij, be a spring con-
stant, denoting the degree to which agent i and agent
j influence each other’s belief and let q′
i be a prior be-
lief held by agent i with a restoring force ki. Then the
Hamiltonian for this system in canonical coordinates is
given by,
H(q, p) =
X
i
qi(1 − qi)

ki

. (5)
Assuming each agent experiences stress from an opin-
ion that differs from a fixed (or prior) opinionq′
i, the stan-
dard DeGroot Hamiltonian (stress function) [29, 30, 59]
is similar,
HD(q) =
X
i
ki
2 (qi − q′
i)2 +
X
i<j
kij
2 (qi − qj)2 . (6)
Under most circumstances, q′
i is the initial belief of the
agent, although it can represent any fixed belief that in-
fluences the agent. The repeated averaging dynamics
[29, 30] are derived by differentiating HD with respect
to qi and solving for the local minimum. Agents then
update their belief to the local minimum. Alternatively,
Gavrilets et al. [60] assumes a Jacobi iteration so that,
˙qi = −∂HD
∂qi
, which is consistent with the consensus dy-
namics literature (see [56] for an overview).
A modification to the stress function that is consistent
with the free energy hypothesis [1] is to assume that the
stress of internal model adjustment occurs continuously,
rather than from a fixed initial assumption. This adds
an additional term to Eq. (6),
ˆHD(q) =
X
i
ˆki(ϵ)
2 [qi(t + ϵ) − qi(t)]2
+
X
i
ki
2 (qi − q′
i)2 +
X
i<j
kij
2 (qi − qj)2 , (7)
and allows the stress contributed by the initial belief to
be disregarded (by setting ki = 0) while still producing
transitive dynamics. If ˆki(ϵ) ∝ 1/ϵ then we recover the
form of Eq. (5) from Eq. (7) as ϵ → 0.
The dynamics of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) are fundamentally
different. The kinetic energy term causes belief oscilla-
tion (discussed in detail in the sequel), while this is not
observed in long-run human behavior (though may be
expected in the short term [61]), with convergence to a
consensus opinion expected over time. We can recover
such dynamics by introducing a dissipative element to
the Lagrangian used to generate Eq. (5). As in [32], let,

Like the repeated averaging DeGroot model with increas-
ing peer-pressure [29, 30, 59], this system converges to
consensus when ki = 0 for all i; that is, when there are
no external spring forces outside of the agents’ beliefs.
The oscillating behavior for smaller values of α is consis-
tent with some theories of human cognition (see Fink et
al. [61, 62] and their references), which assert that beliefs
will oscillate, going so far as to use a spring analogy. Con-
vergence to consensus is illustrated in Fig. 1 for varying
values of α. It is worth noting that when α is small, con-
vergence does not necessarily occur to a weighted mean of
the initial conditions, as it does in the work of Gavrilets
et al. [60] and in Griffin et al. [29, 30, 59].
Notably when ki > 0 for some i, the inclusion of fixed
external belief forces implies that consensus is not en-
sured, even though the agents converge to fixed beliefs,
as is expected for a dissipative system. This is shown in
Fig. 2, where ki = 0.3 for all i.
For practical modeling purposes, we expect the mass
terms mi and α to be comparatively large, explaining
why decision makers are slow to make changes to their
mental models and do not oscillate substantially in their
beliefs. This reduces the kinetic energy component of the
Hamiltonian, thus making the model much more like the
DeGroot model with an increasing peer-pressure term as
in [30]. Notably the dissipative multiplier is equivalent to
assuming jointly increasing peer-pressure and decreasing
mass. Nevertheless, it is worth studying the Hamiltonian
dynamics in non-dissipative systems as an interesting ex-
ample of a nonlinear spring-mass system in an unusual
geometry. This investigation can also provide insight into
transient belief dynamics.

III. CHAOTIC DYNAMICS IN THE TWO
AGENT SYSTEM
Consider the two-agent Hamiltonian,
H(q, p) = 1
2q1(1 − q1)p2
1 + 1
2q2(1 − q2)p2
2 + k
2 DJ(q1, q2),
(9)
where mass constants are unitized for simplicity and
DJ(q1, q2) is the Jeffrey’s divergence,
DJ(q1, q2) = D(q1, q2) + D(q2, q1).
This is a classic two-mass spring system in a non-
Euclidean geometry. In the Euclidean case, it is easy
to see the resulting dynamics are integrable and admit
two constants of motion, the energy (given by the corre-
sponding Hamiltonian) and the linear momentum of the
total system. In contrast, we can show numerically that
the Hamiltonian dynamics in Eq. (9) are not integrable,
showing signs of weak chaos [63].
Introduce the canonical coordinate transform,
qi = cos2
θi
2

i ∈ {1, 2}. (10)
Then Eq. (9) becomes a classical non-linear spring Hamil-

(11)
As expected and consistent with Eq. (5), the second order
approximation for this is,
H0(θ, ω) = p2
1
2 + p2
2
2 + k
2 (θ1 − θ2)2 + O(∥θ∥3). (12)
Consequently, we can express H(θ, ω) as,
H(θ, ω) = H0(θ, ω) + ϵH1(θ, ω),
where H0 is an integrable Hamiltonian, ϵ is a perturba-
tion constant and H1 is the nonlinear Hamiltonian per-
turbation. Since the coordinate transform in Eq. (10) is
a diffeomorphism, we expect to see Hamiltonian chaos
arise in the dynamics generated by Eq. (9). We find ev-
idence for weak chaos [63] associated to behavior near
the manifold boundary. To obtain this result, we used a
time-varying estimate for the maximum Lyapunov expo-
nent of the dynamical system using the Wolf algorithm
[64]. In particular, we used Sandri’s implementation of
the Wolf algorithm [65], which returns an estimation of
the the Lyapunov spectrum using a single long trajectory
after an initial burn-in period. Fig. 3 shows the instan-
taneous estimates of the maximum Lyapunov exponent
during algorithm execution over the long trajectory. The
final estimate provided by the algorithm for the maxi-
mum Lyapunov exponent is λ ≈ 0.0003 > 0. Positivity
of the maximum Lyapunov exponent is further supported
by the fact that the trajectory shown in Fig. 3 turns up
after an initial period of decay. In Fig. 3, the spring
constant k = 2, which improves numerical stability of
the long trajectory required to execute the Wolf algo-
rithm. The fact that the maximum Lyapunov exponent
is positive and the dynamics play out on a compact set
is sufficient to conclude that they are (weakly) chaotic.
FIG. 3. The Wolf algorithm [64] is used to estimate the Lya-
punov spectrum for the Hamiltonian dynamics arising from
Eq. (9). The upturn in the plot of the estimate for the maxi-
mum Lyapunov exponent suggests weak chaos caused by be-
havior near the boundaries of the space. The Wolf algorithm
estimate for the maximum Lyapunov is λ ≈ 0.0003 > 0.
This is consistent with prior results for Hamiltonian
chaos on a compact set defined by the unit simplex that
showed that the chaotic dynamics arose as a result of
interactions with the boundary [66]. This Hamiltonian
system is unusual in that it has an infinite line of fixed
points q1 = q2 and p1 = p2 = 0. The result is a de-
generacy, which makes application of the classical Kol-
mogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem impossible [67]
because the dynamics generated by H0 evolve on a cylin-
der homeomorphic to S1 × R, rather than the two-torus
S2. From this we see that sensitivity to initial condi-
tions and the classical behaviors associated to weak chaos
emerge as a result of asymmetries in the initial condi-
tions. This is shown in Fig. 4, where we fix q2(0) = 1
4
and vary q1(0), illustrating the distinct trajectory struc-
tures that emerge. In Fig. 4, we project all trajectories
onto the plane q1 +q2 = 1, effectively collapsing the cylin-
ders on which the dynamics evolve near the interior fixed
point q1 = q2 = 1
2 into ellipses. These nested cylinders

spanned by u = ⟨0, 0, 1⟩ and v = ⟨ 1√
2 , − 1√
2 , 0⟩. We fix
q2(0) = 1
4 and vary q1(0). As the initial condition for q1 is
varied, the structure of the trajectory ( q1, q2) changes. When
q1(0) is close to 1
2 , the dynamics are in a spatial region that is
largely flat and the trajectories are projected ellipses. When
q1(0) is far from 1
2 , the geometry influences the trajectory and
the trajectories are more chaotic.
are (essentially) degenerate KAM tori. This is because
of the region in the interior of unit simplex, where the
geometry is locally Euclidean. In this region, the behav-
ior of the system is given almost entirely by a two-mass
and spring system. Non-integrability (and thus the de-
struction of additional conserved quantities) is only in-
troduced when the dynamics interact with the boundary,
which induces an effective nonlinear force, not present in
Euclidean space. That is, when q1(0) is near the bound-
ary, we see a more chaotic trajectory emerge in Fig. 4 a
result of the boundary interactions.

IV. CONTROL OF OPINION DYNAMICS
The introduction of nonlinear forces from the geometry
of the space itself has implications for the corresponding
control problem, which can provide insights into under-
standing persuasion in bivalent topics [68]. Of particular
interest is the question of whether an external belief (i.e.,
perceived evidence) or its associated spring constant (i.e.,
social pressure) are more effective control parameters.
Formally stated, given a binary belief in θ-coordinates
and an initial belief θ0, the goal is to use either an exter-
nal belief θ′ or the associated spring constant k to move θ
to a desired target θf in time horizon T while minimizing
the objective function,
O =
Z tf
t0
p2
2 + C(k, θ, θ′) dt, (13)
where C(k, θ, θ′) is a cost associated to the control param-
eter. The exact definition of C depends on the method of
control (external belief or spring constant) and is speci-
fied in the following. We include the kinetic energy term
in Eq. (13) because without some cost associated to mo-
mentum, Eq. (13) degenerates into a “bang-bang” style
control problem [69]. Additionally, the momentum cost
is related to the “accumulated surprise” generated by the
control signal [68], and minimizing the accumulated sur-
prise is consistent with the free energy principle.
We work inθ coordinates for simplicity of form and be-
cause the resulting dynamics are more numerically sta-
ble. The associated control Hamiltonian (which is dis-
tinct from the system Hamiltonian H) [70] is,
H = p2
2 + C(k, θ, θ′) + λ∂H
∂p − µ∂H
∂θ , (14)
where λ and µ are the Lagrange multipliers associated to
θ and p, respectively.
For the θ′-control case we define the cost function,
CD(θ, θ′) = βD[cos2(θ/2), cos2(θ′/2)],
and suppose that the state dynamics are derived from
the full Hamiltonian H from Eq. (11) with θ1 = θ and
θ2 = θ′. The optimal control path resulting from Eq. (14)
is characterized by Pontryagin’s maximum principle [71],
as usual. Since the resulting system of differential equa-
tions is poorly behaved, we also consider the second-order
approximation to H with cost function,
CS(θ, θ′) = β
4 (θ − θ′)2,
and state dynamics given by Eq. (12). The approximate
control problem is quadratic in cost with linear dynamics
(LQC) and, consequently, is much better behaved [70].
As long as both belief boundary conditions are suf-
ficiently removed from the edges of the space, the θ′-
control problem is well behaved and the second-order ap-
proximation is reasonably accurate. The system becomes
poorly behaved numerically in regions near certainty be-
cause the curvature of the information manifold makes
both the cost and the state dynamics stiff. Additionally,
the approximate control problem begins to exhibit wrap-
ping in this regime, resulting in non-physical solutions.
Since the control variable acts via the KL-divergence,
which is unbounded on the manifold, it would seem pos-
sible to reach any target belief within an arbitrary time
horizon. However the Fisher-Rao metric is poorly condi-
tioned near the manifold boundaries so that in practice
the control problem becomes intractable, in addition to
a potential breakdown in overall model fidelity.
To demonstrate, consider boundary values θ(0) =
2 arccos
√
0.5 and θ(3) = 2 arccos
√
0.9 ( q0 = 0 .5 and
qf = 0.9, respectively) and parameters α = 0.5, β = 10,
and k = 1. Additionally assume zero initial momen-
tum, p(0) = 0 , and the transversality boundary value
µ(3) = 0. For the exact formulation of the control prob-
lem, a globally optimal solution can be found numerically
using standard solvers. For the approximate formulation,
an approximately optimal control path can be written
analytically, as it is a LQC problem [70]. We can model
the behavior of this solution under the full system dy-
namics by using the approximate control to propagate
the forward initial value problem defined via H. Fig. 5
shows the resulting control paths θ′ and corresponding
belief evolution in probability coordinates q for both the
exact and approximate control problems. The two so-
lutions are fairly similar with the approximate solution
achieving a final belief value of qf = 0.93 instead of the
intended qf = 0.9.
Since the spring potential is smaller than the KL-
divergence, particularly near the boundaries where the
KL-divergence goes to infinity, we find that the approxi-
mate solution generally achieves a boundary value more
extreme (closer to the boundaries of the manifold) than
the desired target when applied to the exact dynamics.
This is an acceptable error in most applications, although
it does come with the increased costs associated to using
a non-optimal solution.

FIG. 5. Belief evolution and control for the θ′-control formu-

formulation of the control Hamiltonian as well as the second-
order approximation in belief coordinates q. The boundary
values correspond to q0 = 0 .5, p0 = 0 and qf = 0 .9 with
α = 0.5, β= 10, k= 1 and time horizon T = 3.
While proximity to the geometric boundary drives stiff-
ness in the control problem, this can be ameliorated to
6
some extent by choosing a longer time horizon T. We
can very roughly approximate a lower bound for an ac-
ceptable time horizon by solving the approximate control
problem with the maximum (minimum) possible control
input θ′ = π (θ′ = 0), to estimate the shortest horizon
over which the desired belief target can be met with-
out “wrapping” the control. While this lower bound
doesn’t have a clean analytic formula, it is straightfor-
ward to compute numerically. Using the parameter val-
ues above the minimum time horizon to avoid wrapping
is T ≈ 1.9. Numerical experimentation indicates that
reasonable control solutions can be found for T > 2.2,
below which both the exact system and the forward sim-
ulation of the approximate control system become stiff.
As T approaches this threshold the approximate control
curve gets closer to the boundaries of the geometry, and
the approximation breaks down.
As an alternative to controlling the belief distribu-
tion by changing θ′, we can instead fix θ′ = θf to be
the desired belief and use the spring constant k as the
control parameter. We use the same objective function
as Eq. (13) with the quadratic cost CK(k) = βk2. We
use this cost for both the exact dynamics, given by H,
and approximate dynamics, given by H0. The result-
ing k-control problems do not appear to have a simple
closed-form solution. However, the approximate control
problem is again a LQC problem and both formulations
are much better behaved numerically than the θ′-control
formulation. This is because the control parameter k
does not lie on the information manifold and is not as
strongly impacted by the manifold curvature.
As an example, consider the same control problem as
above except with θ′ = 3 arccos
√
0.9 and T = 1. As
before, we compute both the solution to the full control
Hamiltonian as well as the approximate control Hamilto-
nian. For the approximate solution we again recompute
the forward problem using the exact dynamics. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 6. Again the second-order ap-
proximation provides reasonable control of the full sys-
tem, although the approximate solution underestimates
the response of the belief to the control variable for the
same reasons as the θ′-control case. The approximate so-
lution produces a final belief of qf = 0.94, instead of the
intended target qf = 0.9.
Notably the time horizon for this formulation of the
problem is smaller than the minimum threshold esti-
mated for the θ′-control formulation. Since k is not
bounded by the information geometry there is no cor-
responding threshold in the k-control case and the nu-
merical problem remains tractable down to T ≈ 0.1.
While a more thorough analysis of this information
control problem, including joint ( k, θ′)-control, is out-
side the scope of this paper, this initial analysis indi-
cates that the spring constant (i.e., social pressure) is a
more robust control parameter than the observed belief.
At a high level this is because the spring constant pro-
duces information potentials which scale linearly, while
the observed belief can only achieve large potentials by

interacting with the highly curved portions of the man-
ifold boundary. Additionally, the simpler second-order
approximation to the control problem, which utilizes tra-
ditional spring potentials and is a LQC problem, can pro-
duce effective control solutions, particularly in regions of
high entropy.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this paper, we introduced a model of belief combin-
ing Friston’s minimum energy principle and information
geometry, making use of the Bayesian brain hypothesis.
Using a Bernoulli distribution as a model of an agent’s
belief about a bivalent topic (e.g., humans cause climate
change), we showed how to recover a variant of DeGroot
opinion dynamics via a classical Lagrangian. We fur-
ther showed conditions under which opinion converges or
comes to consensus through the use of a dissipative La-
grangian. In studying the nonlinear dynamics for two
agents arising from the non-dissipative form of the La-
grangian, we showed that the corresponding Hamiltonian
was a perturbation of a well-known integrable Hamilto-
nian. Despite the fact that the KAM theorem does not
apply in this case, we illustrated symplectic flow near
the fixed points and used Wolf’s algorithm to numeri-
cally prove the existence of chaotic behavior in trajecto-
ries near the boundary.
In studying the control problem arising from these dy-
namics, we identified interesting facts about the problem
of persuasion. We found that manipulating peer pres-
sure with a fixed (preferred) belief state is a more sta-
ble approach to altering an agent’s belief than providing
a slowly changing belief state that approaches a target.

These results may have real-world implications. Prior re-
search shows that peer-pressure is a powerful motivator
for inducing cooperation [72], especially (for example)
in climate change beliefs and actions [73, 74]. More-
over, while information innoculation appears to be the
most effective counter-misinformation strategy, research
supports the hypothesis that “nudging” (through social
pressure) provides a potentially useful way to counter-act
misinformation as opposed to “debunking”, which has
been shown to be less effective [75]. The mathematical
results presented in this paper provide the first poten-
tial explanation for these empirical observations using a
biophysical model. As such, further research into model
generalizations may provide additional insights into per-
suasion and misinformation management.
