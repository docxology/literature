ABSTRACT
Nonlinearmean-fieldmodelsofthe solardynamoshowlong-termvariability,whichmaybe relevant
to different states of activity inferred fromlong-termradiocarbondata. This paper is aimed to probe
the dynamo hysteresis predicted by the recent mean-field models of Kitchatinov & Olemskoy (2010)
with direct numerical simulations. We perform three-dimensional simulations of large-scale dynamos
ina shearingbox withhelically forcedturbulence. As initialcondition,we either takea weakrandom
magnetic field or we start from a snapshot of an earlier simulation. Two quasi-stable states are
found to coexist in a certain range of parameters close to the onset of the large-scale dynamo. The
simulations converge to one of these states depending on the initial conditions. When either the
fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is increased between successive runs above the
critical value for onset of the dynamo, the field strength jumps to a finite value. However, when the
fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is then decreased again, the field strength stays
at a similar value (strong field branch) even below the original onset. We also observe intermittent
decayingphases awayfromthe strongfieldbranchcloseto the point wherelarge-scaledynamoaction

Rempel et al. (2009), but for an incompressible fluid. In
the nonlinear regime, Brummell et al. (2001) found two
distinct classes of behavior depending on the initial hy-

earlier results by Fuchs et al. (1999) in spherical geome-
try. Oneproducesthestationarysolutionfollowedbyan
initial exponential growthof the magnetic field, whereas
the other initially produces a dynamo solution but later
turns into a decaying one because the flow itself evolves
to a non-dynamo stage through hydrodynamic instabil-
ity. However, our study of hysteresis is different from
Brummell et al. (2001) because we take different initial
conditions for velocity as well as magnetic fields and we
believe that the magnetic quenching rather than the hy-
drodynamic instability is the cause of the bistability.

ceases. The maximum period for G2 dwarfs is only
slightly larger than the rotation period of the Sun (see
Fig.1 in Rengarajan1984). The stars showing low mag-
netic activity similar to the solar grandminima are typ-
ically old and slow rotators (Saar & Baliunas 1992).
We note that the grand minima in models based on
stochastic fluctuations (e.g., Hoyng 1993; Hoyng et al.
1994;Brandenburg & Spiegel2008;Moss et al.2008) al-
ways result in random deviations from a single (regu-
lar) state. Thanks to the reconstructed solar activity
record(Usoskin et al.2014), however,a differentpicture
emerges in that the grand minima cannot be described
in terms of randomfluctuations of a single solar-activity
mode, but are distinct from the regular mode and pro-
duced as a result of sudden transitions from the regular
mode to weak-field mode.
Transitions between the distinct dynamo regimes may
be caused by small-scale hydromagnetic fluctuations in-
herentto3Dsimulations. Thetransitionsdoindeedhap-
