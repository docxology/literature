ABSTRACT
Nonlinear mean-ﬁeld models of the solar dynamo show long-term varia bility, which may be relevant
to diﬀerent states of activity inferred from long-term radiocarbo n data. This paper is aimed to probe
the dynamo hysteresis predicted by the recent mean-ﬁeld models o f Kitchatinov & Olemskoy (2010)
with direct numerical simulations. We perform three-dimensional sim ulations of large-scale dynamos
in a shearing box with helically forced turbulence. As initial condition, w e either take a weak random
magnetic ﬁeld or we start from a snapshot of an earlier simulation. Tw o quasi-stable states are
found to coexist in a certain range of parameters close to the onse t of the large-scale dynamo. The
simulations converge to one of these states depending on the initial conditions. When either the
fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is increased bet ween successive runs above the
critical value for onset of the dynamo, the ﬁeld strength jumps to a ﬁnite value. However, when the
fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is then decreas ed again, the ﬁeld strength stays
at a similar value (strong ﬁeld branch) even below the original onset. We also observe intermittent
decaying phases away from the strong ﬁeld branch close to the poin t where large-scale dynamo action
is just possible. The dynamo hysteresis seen previously in mean-ﬁeld models is thus reproduced by 3D
simulations. Its possible relation to distinct modes of solar activity su ch as grand minima is discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
The solar magnetic activity cycle is not a strictly pe-
riodic phenomenon. Its duration and strength vary from
cycle to cycle. An impressive example of this aperiodic-
ity is the famous Maunder minimum when sunspots were
extremely scarce over about 70 years (Hoyt & Schatten
1996). Prolonged events of low magnetic activity like
the Maunder minimum are typical characteristics of the
Sun. Radiocarbon data reveal solar activity variations
for the past ∼ 11, 000 years with 27 grand minima cover-
ing about 17% of the time (Usoskin et al. 2007; Usoskin
2013).
Based on the extensive literature on nonlinear dy-
namos displaying long-term variability, we can classify
two broad theories of grand minima: amplitude mod-
ulation through nonlinearity (Spiegel 1977; Tavakol
1978; Ruzmaikin 1981) and externally imposed noise
(Choudhuri 1992), as has been extensively reviewed
by Charbonneau (2010). Amplitude modulation is
found to exist in many nonlinear dynamo models. This
can result from the coupling between various dynamo
modes with close frequencies (e.g., Brandenburg et al.
1989a,b; Sokoloﬀ & Nesme-Ribes 1994; Beer et al.
1998; Brooke et al. 1998), and/or from the interac-
tion between magnetic ﬁeld and diﬀerential rotation
(Kitchatinov et al. 1994; K¨ uker et al. 1999). However,
the latter is less likely to apply to the Sun on the
grounds that the variation in observed diﬀerential
rotation is weak. Chaotic behavior of nonlinear dynamo

models was also identiﬁed to be a cause of amplitude
modulation in low-order models (e.g., Weiss et al.
1984). Originally this appeared to be a feature of
highly truncated models, but it was later also found
in two-dimensional models (Covas et al. 1998). On the
other hand, since turbulence is the driver of dynamo
action in stars, grand minima through the resulting
noise could be possible. Indeed, dynamo coeﬃcients
such as the α eﬀect and also the Babcock–Leighton
type α eﬀect (through variations in the tilt angle of
bipolar active regions; Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010) are
known to ﬂuctuate (Hoyng 1988; Brandenburg et al.
2008). Therefore, ﬂuctuations in the dynamo param-
eters (e.g., Choudhuri 1992; Moss et al. 1992; Hoyng
1993; Ossendrijver et al. 1996; Charbonneau et al.
2004; Moss et al. 2008; Choudhuri & Karak 2009;
Passos et al. 2014) and even the meridional circulation
(Karak 2010) are naturally invoked to explain the origin
of grand minima. Turbulence also introduces “magnetic
noise” that directly aﬀects the mean electromotive
force (Brandenburg & Spiegel 2008). The ﬂuctuations
cause irregular changes in dynamo cycle amplitudes
with occasional wandering into states of low cycle
strength. Dynamo models with ﬂuctuating parameters
generally reproduce the grand minima statistics (e.g.,
Choudhuri & Karak 2012; Karak & Choudhuri 2013;
Olemskoy & Kitchatinov 2013). Recent analysis of
radiocarbon data by Usoskin et al. (2014), however,
showed that grand minima do not constitute a low-
activity tail of the distribution common for all activity
cycles, but represent a separate activity mode that
2 Karak et al.
cannot be interpreted as a ﬂuctuation of the ‘regular’
mode. They concluded that solar dynamo regimes in
grand minima and in regular cycles are distinct.
The diﬀerence in dynamo operation between grand
minima and regular activity modes can be in-
terpreted as a consequence of a hysteresis phe-
nomenon found in nonlinear mean-ﬁeld dynamo mod-
els (Kitchatinov & Olemskoy 2010). In the majority of
such models of the solar dynamo, suppression of poloidal
ﬁeld generation by the magnetic ﬁeld ( α-quenching) is in-
voked. This nonlinearity serves well for stabilizing mag-
netic ﬁeld growth. The dynamo ampliﬁcation of the mag-
netic ﬁeld takes place when the dynamo number
D = α∆Ω R3
⊙
η2
T
(1)
exceeds a critical value Dc, where ηT = η + ηt is the
total (microphysical plus turbulent) magnetic diﬀusivity,
∆Ω is the angular velocity variation in the Sun, and α is
the measure of the α eﬀect; see Krause & R¨ adler (1980).
A decrease in α with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength
reduces the eﬀective dynamo number to saturate the ﬁeld
growth.
However, not only α but also the eddy diﬀusivity ηt is
magnetically quenched. Using predictions of the quasi-
linear theory for α- and ηt-quenching results in a non-
monotonous dependence of the eﬀective (magnetically
modiﬁed) dynamo number on the magnetic ﬁeld (see
Fig. 1 in Kitchatinov & Olemskoy 2010). This number
initially increases with the magnetic ﬁeld but the de-
pendence changes to a decrease for stronger ﬁelds. If
the dynamo number (1) is increased from a subcritical
value, the saturated ﬁeld amplitude jumps to a ﬁnite
value of the order of the equipartition ﬁeld just after
D exceeds Dc and then varies smoothly with increas-
ing D (R¨ udiger et al. 1994). If the dynamo number is
then decreased, dynamo-generated ﬁnite ﬁelds survive for
D < Dc, but for suﬃciently small values of D, the ﬁeld
eventually falls to zero. The saturated ﬁeld amplitude,
therefore, depends on the pre-history of the D variation
(the dynamo hysteresis). In a ﬁnite range of D-values,
there are two stable solutions with considerably diﬀerent
characteristic strengths of the magnetic ﬁeld. Fluctua-
tions in dynamo parameters provoke irregular transitions
between these two solutions (Kitchatinov & Olemskoy
2010). The dynamo hysteresis can thus explain the
distinction between grand minima and regular activity
modes found by Usoskin et al. (2014).
Kitchatinov & Olemskoy (2010) used a mean-ﬁeld dy-
namo model that cannot be free from arbitrary pre-
scriptions. Apart from magnetic quenching of α and
ηt , there are other nonlinearities that all are implic-
itly present in direct numerical simulations. This paper
probes the dynamo hysteresis with such simulations. Us-
ing a shearing box setup, we perform simulations of heli-
cally forced turbulence, which produce oscillating (solar-
type) dynamos. In principle, this can also be stud-
ied in realistic global rotating magneto-convection sim-
ulations in spherical geometry (e.g., Racine et al. 2011;
Nelson et al. 2013; Karak et al. 2015), but those simu-
lations are computationally more demanding and would
beneﬁt from guidance through simpler turbulence simu-
lations. By varying the amount of relative kinetic helic-
ity, the hysteresis-type dependence of the oscillation am-
plitude on the pre-history of helicity variations is clearly
seen. Similar behavior is also found when magnetic dif-
fusion is varied. The simulations generally conﬁrm the
presence of two distinct regimes of large-scale dynamos
in the vicinity of the dynamo threshold.
We note that turbulent large-scale dynamos near onset
have already been studied by Rempel et al. (2009), who
used ABC ﬂow forcing. They found intermittent large-
scale ﬁelds right after dynamo onset, but in their case no
cyclic dynamos were possible nor did they ﬁnd evidence
of two distinct states.
2. THE MODEL SETUP
In our model, we assume the ﬂuid to be isothermal and
compressible. It obeys the equation of state p = c2
s ρ, with
constant sound speed cs. Hence we solve the following
equations:
DU
Dt = −SUx ˆy−c2

Dt = −∇ · U, (3)

· ∇A = −SAy ˆx + U × B + η∇2A. (4)
Here D/Dt = ∂/∂t + ( U + U
(S)
) · ∇ is the advective
time derivative, U
(S)
= (0 , Sx, 0) with S = const is the
imposed uniform large-scale shear ﬂow, ν is the constant
kinematic viscosity, A is the magnetic vector potential,
B = ∇ × A is the magnetic ﬁeld, J = µ−1
0 ∇ × B is
the current density, η is the constant microscopic dif-
fusivity, and f is a forcing function to be speciﬁed be-
low. The traceless rate of strain tensor S is given by
Sij = 1
2 (Ui,j + Uj,i ) − 1
3 δij ∇ · U, where the commas de-
note partial diﬀerentiation with respect to the coordinate
(j or i). The contribution of
U
(S)
to S is omitted, be-
cause it would only introduce a small contribution.
Turbulence is sustained by supplying energy to the sys-
tem through a forcing function f = f(x, t), which is
helical and random in time ( δ-correlated). It is deﬁned
as
f(x, t) = Re {Nfk(t) exp[ik(t) · x + iφ(t)]}, (5)
where x is the position vector. At each timestep the
wavevector k(t) randomly takes any value from many
possible wavevectors in a certain range around a given
forcing wavenumber kf . The phase −π < φ (t) ≤ π
also changes randomly at every timestep. On dimen-
sional grounds, we choose N = f0cs(|k|cs/δt)1/ 2, where
f0 is a non-dimensional forcing amplitude. The trans-
verse helical waves are produced via Fourier amplitudes

large-scale magnetic ﬁeld as a function of σ (Set I). The ﬁlled cir-
cles (Runs A–L) and the red diamonds (Runs E1–E12) are from
simulations which started with weak random seed ﬁelds and st rong
oscillatory ﬁelds of the previous simulation, respectivel y. Arrows
denote the zero values for Runs A–D. Runs E5–E11 show intermi t-
tent behavior.
The ﬂuid and magnetic Reynolds numbers and the
magnetic Prandtl number are deﬁned as
Re = urms/νkf , R m = urms/ηkf , P m = ν/η, (7)
where urms = ⟨u2⟩1/ 2 is the rms value of the velocity
in the statistically stationary state with ⟨·⟩denoting the
average over the whole domain and kf is the mean forcing
wavenumber.
The boundary conditions are shearing–periodic in the
x direction and periodic in the y and z directions, with
dimensions Lx = Ly = Lz = 2 π. We always choose
S = −0.2, f0 = 0 .01 and kf = 5 k1 or 3 k1, where k1 =
2π/Lx = 1 is the smallest possible wavenumber of the
box. We use non-dimensional units by setting cs = ρ0 =
µ0 = 1, where ρ0 = ⟨ρ⟩ is the volume-averaged density,
which is constant in time. As initial conditions we take
u = ln ρ = 0 and a small-scale low amplitude (10 −4)
Gaussian noise for A. All computations are performed
using the Pencil Code1. The grid resolution of all runs
presented in this paper is 96 × 96 × 96.
3. RESULTS
We begin by focusing on the following two sets of sim-
ulations. In one, we have simulations for diﬀerent values
of σ, taking weak ﬁelds as initial conditions (described
in §2). These simulations are performed to identify the
onset of the dynamo. In the other set, we take as initial
conditions a snapshot of a previous simulation right after
the onset of dynamo action. The corresponding dynamo
solution is oscillatory. We perform several simulations by
successively reducing the helicity by a small value and
using the resulting ﬁelds of the previous simulation as
the initial condition. We continue this procedure until
there is only a decaying solution. In this way we identify
the regime of dynamo hysteresis as the location where,
depending on the initial conditions, both non-decaying
oscillatory dynamos and decaying solutions are possible,
i.e., the system becomes bistable. Finally, we repeat the

eq (which may be considered as a measure
of sunspot number). Here we do not see clear magnetic
oscillations. A few cycles started to appear at around
t = 2, but they did not survive. The overall ﬁeld is also
very weak. On increasing σ slightly we observe a dy-
namo transition at σ = 0 .322 (Run E) and the magnetic
ﬁeld becomes strong (
Brms > B eq). Hence the critical
value of σ for dynamo action is σc ≈ 0.322. The spatio-
temporal variation for this case is shown in Figure 3,
where we see clear magnetic cycles with dynamo wave
propagation along the positive z direction. Together with
positive helicity (which results in a negative α) and nega-
tive shear, migration in the positive z direction is indeed
expected. However, the cycles are not regular; the am-
plitude varies from cycle to cycle, similar to the observed
solar cycle. We recall that in stochastically forced mean-
ﬁeld dynamo models, the cycle irregularity is related to
the amount of imposed ﬂuctuations and the correspond-
ing coherence times (see examples in Charbonneau 2010;
Karak & Choudhuri 2011). In the present simulations,
however, this cycle irregularity is naturally coming be-
cause of the ﬁnite number of eddies and it is directly

Now we take a snapshot of a simulation at σ = σc =
0.322 (Run E, which is shown in Figure 3) and per-
form a set of simulations by reducing σ slowly and tak-
ing the output of the previous simulation as the ini-
tial conditions. Runs E1–E12 in Table 1 represent such
cases and the corresponding
Brms are shown in Fig-
ure 1 as red diamonds. We observe oscillatory solu-
tions over a broad parameter range, 0 .22 ≤ σ < 0.322,

in which there are otherwise decaying solutions when
started from weak ﬁelds. Therefore, in this range, the
results depend on the initial conditions, i.e., system be-
comes bistable. All the simulations are run for a suﬃ-
ciently long time to ensure that they remain in the same
state.
We recall that Brummell et al. (2001) studied
the linear and nonlinear dynamo properties using time-
dependent ABC ﬂows forcing in triply periodic Carte-
Hysteresis in turbulent dynamos 5
sian geometry. Their simulations are similar to those of
Rempel et al. (2009), but for an incompressible ﬂuid. In
the nonlinear regime, Brummell et al. (2001) found two
distinct classes of behavior depending on the initial hy-
dromagnetic properties of the forced ABC ﬂow, similar to
earlier results by Fuchs et al. (1999) in spherical geome-
try. One produces the stationary solution followed by an
initial exponential growth of the magnetic ﬁeld, whereas
the other initially produces a dynamo solution but later
turns into a decaying one because the ﬂow itself evolves
to a non-dynamo stage through hydrodynamic instabil-
ity. However, our study of hysteresis is diﬀerent from
Brummell et al. (2001) because we take diﬀerent initial
conditions for velocity as well as magnetic ﬁelds and we
believe that the magnetic quenching rather than the hy-
drodynamic instability is the cause of the bistability.
In Figure 4 we show the magnetic oscillations from
the last run (Run E11) at σ = 0 .22, below which the
oscillations die completely. We see that the magnetic
cycles persist most of the time in this simulation. The
interesting feature is that occasionally some of the cycles
disappear or become weaker. By comparing the ﬁrst two
panels of Figure 4 we note that during weaker cycles (for
example, at t ∼ 130 and 154),
Bx is not reduced as much
as By, implying that the α eﬀect dominates over the
Ω eﬀect. This kind of intermittent behavior somewhat
resembles the grand minima observed in the Sun. We see
a similar behavior for many runs in the bistable region,
particularly in Runs E5–E11.
3.3. Dynamo hysteresis: dependence onPm
To explore the robustness of the existence of dynamo
hysteresis, we repeat the same procedure in diﬀerent pa-
rameter regimes of the simulations. Here we ﬁx σ at 1
(fully helical ﬂow) but vary the magnetic diﬀusivity η
in each simulation; see Runs N–Z of Set II in Table 1.
Hence, Pm varies, but ν = 0 .005 is unchanged. This is
similar to the experiments of Rempel et al. (2009), who
used ABC ﬂow forcing.
The black points in Figure 5 show
Brms from diﬀerent
simulations started with weak seed ﬁelds as the initial
conditions (Runs N–Z). We see that when Pm just ex-
ceeds about 0.29, the dynamo is excited and the magnetic
ﬁeld becomes oscillatory. The critical Pm for dynamo ac-
tion is P c
m ≈ 0.294.
Next, as before, we take an oscillatory dynamo solu-
tion (Run T) as the initial condition for the new simu-
lation and decrease Pm by a small value progressively in
each simulation by taking as initial conditions the last
snapshot from the previous simulation. Runs T1–T12 in
Table 1 are such examples and the corresponding
Brms
are shown as red diamonds in Figure 5. We see that,
up to about Pm = 0 .16, we obtain an oscillatory large-
scale magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 6 shows the typical magnetic
cycles from a simulation at Pm = 0 .1613 (Run T6) be-
low which the oscillation dies. Note that in the bistable
stage, unlike the previous set of simulations, for exam-
ple shown in Figure 4 where some of the magnetic cycles
disappear occasionally, here we observe cycles all of the
time. However when we repeat the whole procedure at
σ = 0 .5 instead of 1, we see this kind of intermittent
behavior in the bistable regime. To obtain even more
conﬁdence in the results we have repeated another set of
Fig. 5.— Similar to Figure 1, but from a diﬀerent set of sim-
ulations (Set II, Runs N–T12; see also Table 1) where η is varied
while σ and ν are held ﬁxed.

0.1613, just above the value for the decaying solution (Run T6) .

simulations are at slightly higher Rm. Table 2 gives a
summary of these runs, and Figure 7 shows the corre-
sponding dynamo hysteresis. We clearly see a similar
behavior.
4. COMPARISON WITH ANALYTIC PREDICTIONS
To understand why the hysteresis discussed in this pa-
per has not been seen before, we need to assess more care-
fully the parameter regimes of our solutions. Given that
we use (shearing) periodic boundary conditions, there are
no magnetic helicity ﬂuxes in or out of the domain, so
we can describe the solutions by comparing with the an-
alytic results of Blackman & Brandenburg (2002, here-
after BB02). The dynamical quenching theory used in
BB02 was already compared with numerical solutions by
K¨ apyl¨ a & Brandenburg (2009). One of the predictions
they tested was that the saturation level of the mean
magnetic ﬁeld, which they gave in the form

Figure 8 shows our data from two sets of simulations
(Sets I–II) which produce signiﬁcant large-scale magnetic
ﬁelds, i.e., Runs E–E11 from Set I and Runs T–T6 from
Set II. We have added labels to some of the data points to
identify the runs. We note that, unlike Figures 1 and 5,
where we have plotted

but in a smaller range, which is why the data in Fig-
ure 8 show a nearly linear variation. Even in a limited
range, apart from a small oﬀset, there is a reasonable
agreement between our data and the theory given by
Equation (8); see the dotted line in Figure 8. However,
K¨ apyl¨ a & Brandenburg (2009) had data in a wider range
and found better agreement for higher ﬁeld strengths.
In Figure 8 we observe that, when increasing the helic-
ity parameter σ (from Runs E to M in Set I), both the
wavenumber ratio of ﬂuctuating to mean ﬁelds, as de-

asterisks are from Runs E1–E11 (red points in Figure 1). The
black squares represent data from Runs T–Z of Set II (also rep re-

ﬁned by Equation (9), and the strength of the mean ﬁeld
decrease. A similar trend is followed while decreasing σ
(Runs E1–E8), except for the last few runs (Runs E9–
E11), which deviate signiﬁcantly. Qualitatively similar
behavior is observed in Set II, when Pm is decreased from
Runs T1 to T6, although they consistently deviate from
the other runs. However for Runs T–Z, the trend is not
monotonous.
Another prediction of BB02 was that ǫm is directly
proportional to the ratio of poloidal to toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld amplitudes via
ǫm =

) 1/ 2
. (10)
From Equation (9) we compute ǫm by assuming km =
−k1 and show in Figure 9 a scatter plot of ǫm versus

Equation (10), as indicated by the dotted line. In Set I,
with increasing σ from Runs E to M, the ratio of the
poloidal to toroidal ﬁeld increases, but the same hap-
pens from Runs E1 to E11 with decreasing σ as well,
which was unexpected. The same trend is observed as
we decrease Pm from Runs T1 to T6 in Set II, but in
Runs T–Z the variation is not monotonous. Furthermore,
we note that the data points corresponding to two dif-
ferent regimes—subcritical and supercritical—lie on dif-
ferent lines (compare red and black points in Figure 9).
We note that in Figure 8, and also to some extent
in Figure 9, the simulation data are systematically be-
low the analytically expected values. A smaller value
of
Brms could readily be explained as being a combi-
nation of several modes, which results in reduced aver-
ages. This is reminiscent of the fratricide αΩ dynamos
of Hubbard et al. (2011), who found that they can be
destroyed by their growing α2 dynamo siblings. An im-
portant diﬀerence, however, is that they never found the
Hysteresis in turbulent dynamos 7

recovery of the αΩ dynamo. This might be related to
diﬀerent orderings of the onsets of α2 and αΩ dynamo
action, but this has not been investigated further.
5. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
As discussed in the Introduction, dynamo hystere-
sis predicted by the nonlinear mean-ﬁeld model of
Kitchatinov & Olemskoy (2010) may be relevant to the
understanding of distinct modes of solar activity found
by Usoskin et al. (2014). Our simulations of turbulent
dynamos in shearing boxes with helically forced turbu-
lent ﬂows, which resemble the equivalent αΩ solar dy-
namo, demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, hysteresis behav-
ior. By performing several simulations, either by varying
the helicity parameter σ or the magnetic Prandtl num-
ber Pm, we observe two stable states with largely diﬀer-
ent characteristic ﬁeld strengths depending on the initial
conditions of the simulation. A decaying solution is ob-
tained when the simulation is started with weak random
seed ﬁelds, but otherwise an oscillatory solution is ob-
tained when the simulation is started from a snapshot of
a previous oscillatory dynamo.
We emphasize that our simulations show hysteresis
close to the dynamo onset only. This raises the question
of whether the Sun may be close to the marginal state
for the dynamo. Stellar observations indicate that this
might indeed be the case. Magnetic activity is known
to be correlated with rotation rate, but leads to angu-
lar momentum loss through a magnetically coupled stel-
lar wind (Kraft 1967; Hartmann & Noyes 1987). Spin-
down of solar-type stars does not continue above a cer-
tain rotation period that depends on the spectral type
(Rengarajan 1984). The maximum period probably cor-
responds to the rotation rate where the global dynamo
ceases. The maximum period for G2 dwarfs is only
slightly larger than the rotation period of the Sun (see
Fig. 1 in Rengarajan 1984). The stars showing low mag-
netic activity similar to the solar grand minima are typ-
ically old and slow rotators (Saar & Baliunas 1992).
We note that the grand minima in models based on
stochastic ﬂuctuations (e.g., Hoyng 1993; Hoyng et al.
1994; Brandenburg & Spiegel 2008; Moss et al. 2008) al-
ways result in random deviations from a single (regu-
lar) state. Thanks to the reconstructed solar activity
record (Usoskin et al. 2014), however, a diﬀerent picture
emerges in that the grand minima cannot be described
in terms of random ﬂuctuations of a single solar-activity
mode, but are distinct from the regular mode and pro-
duced as a result of sudden transitions from the regular
mode to weak-ﬁeld mode.
Transitions between the distinct dynamo regimes may
be caused by small-scale hydromagnetic ﬂuctuations in-
herent to 3D simulations. The transitions do indeed hap-
pen in the simulations with relative kinetic helicity below
unity (Figure 4).
The intermittency of distinct dynamo regimes, how-
ever, disappeared for maximally helical forcing (Fig-
ure 6). In mean-ﬁeld language, an increase in fractional
helicity changes the dynamo from αΩ toward α2 type.
There is no hysteresis for the α2 dynamo. In any case,
maximal helical forcing would not be realistic for the Sun.
The dependence of intermittency on the (fractional) he-
licity should be explored further in future
work.
Besides the demonstration of a hysteresis phenomenon
in a turbulent dynamo, we have analyzed the simulation
data to compare with the dynamical theory of BB02.
We observe that the data from subcritical and supercrit-
ical dynamos behave in a qualitatively similar way and
that they are in reasonable agreement with the theoret-
ical predictions. We end by remarking that, although
our ﬁndings of hysteresis between two distinct modes of
dynamos is relevant to the recently discovered bi-modal
solar activity of Usoskin et al. (2014), our simulations
are far from the real Sun. Therefore, future research is
necessary to explore similar behaviors in more realistic
setups.
