Abstract
The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle
(FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the
intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated
this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference con-
sistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity:
variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise
(complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated infor-
mation and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores
organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly
and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no
significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling betweenΦand Bayesian surprise likely re-
flects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated
information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative,
rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory ofΦduring inference can be func-
tionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical
evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspec-
tive offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles
of phenomenology.

Introduction
Contemporary debates on the nature of consciousness have been shaped by two influential frameworks:
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [1–5] and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) [6]. IIT, grounded
in phenomenology, holds that consciousness is identical to a system’s integrated causal structure—an
irreducible cause–effect repertoire quantified byΦ—which specifies how experience exists here and now as
an intrinsic property of the system. In contrast, the FEP provides a normative account of self-organizing
living systems, proposing that agents must minimize variational free energy (VFE) to constrain sensory
surprise. This framework unifies perception, learning, and action under variational Bayesian inference
and active inference. Within this view, deep generative models that enable long-horizon prediction confer
adaptive advantages, suggesting why informational structures associated with consciousness may emerge.
Taken together, these perspectives suggest a complementary path toward synthesis. IIT provides
a proximate explanation, identifying conscious experience with integrated information structure itself,
whereas FEP-based theories of consciousness (e.g., [7–11]) offer an ultimate explanation in terms of tele-
ology and adaptive function, echoing Tinbergen’s classic distinction between the proximate and ultimate
causes [12]. The proposal of conceptual bridges between the two frameworks is a relatively recent devel-
opment. For example, Markovian monism highlights formal parallels between IIT’s complexes and FEP’s
Markov-blanketed agents, both of which insulate internal dynamics while mediating perception–action
exchanges [13]. Similarly, Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) further argues that richly unified
1
arXiv:2510.04084v1  [q-bio.NC]  5 Oct 2025
internal models—those with higherΦ—are favored under active inference because they support long-term
free-energy minimization [14]. Consistent with this view, simulation studies have reported that evolving
agents exhibit decreasing surprise alongside increasingΦ[15]. Collectively, these lines of research moti-
vate a unified account in which integrated informational structure serves simultaneously as the substrate
of experience (IIT) and as an emergent outcome of adaptive inferential dynamics (FEP).
Nevertheless, several important gaps remain. First, most evidence for an IIT–FEP association derives
from theoretical or simulation studies: direct neural evidence from living systems is still scarce. Second,
the often-postulated negative correlation betweenΦand VFE lacks mechanistic grounding and may not
consistently hold, as the moment-to-moment relationships betweenΦand surprise can vary in sign within
a single task [15]. Finally, it remains unsolved how intrinsically integrated information both arises and
operates during variational Bayesian inference under the FEP.
In this study, we address these gaps by employingin vitrodissociated neuronal cultures grown on
high-density multielectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). Previous works have shown that such cultures, when
driven by structured inputs, perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP and can be modeled
by canonical neural networks whose cost function is asymptotically equivalent to VFE [16–19]. Building
on this framework, we repeatedly presented stimuli generated by hidden signal sources and recorded
spiking activity across successive sessions. From these data, we estimated VFE and its decomposition
into Bayesian surprise (complexity) and accuracy. To obtain proxy measures of integrated information,
we computed pairwise synergistic information (ΦR) [20] and constructed weighted graphs, from which
main complexes were extracted using minimum-cut procedures inspired by IIT 2.0-style analyses [21,22].
Based on these considerations, we address the following questions. First, does integrated information
necessarily accompany a decrease in VFE, or does it instead track other FEP-related quantities? Second,
how does integrated information evolve as networks improve inference—does it increase monotonically,
remain stable, or follow a non-linear trajectory? Finally, if a consistent evolution pattern is observed, how
can it be functionally interpreted? Our aim is to answer these questions and to advance the IIT–FEP
dialogue from theoretical plausibility to empirical grounding by jointly quantifying FEP-related quantities
and integrated informational structure in living neural networks. In doing so, we frame consciousness—as
defined by IIT—as the intrinsic manifestation of adaptive belief updating (FEP), thereby bridging the
explanatory “how” and teleological “why” within a unified framework.
Results
Study aims and experimental paradigm
To bridge IIT and the FEP within a living neural system, we examined how integrated information
emerges and functions within a form of self-organization suggested to follow the FEP. We employed
dissociated neuronal cultures grown on HD-MEAs, using a repeated-stimulation paradigm in which prob-
abilistic observations generated by two hidden signal sources were delivered via 32 electrodes (Fig.1, left).
Previous studies have shown that such cultures acquire the capacity to infer hidden sources, with VFE—
empirically computed from a canonical neural network formulation—decreasing during learning [16–19].
Building on this design, we recorded spiking activity as networks inferred and learned, computed FEP-
related quantities (VFE, Bayesian surprise, and accuracy), and derived proxy measures of integrated
information (Φmc
R and coreness) to analyze their trajectories and interrelationships during perceptual
inference.
Within the FEP framework, VFE in variational Bayesian inference under a generative process mod-
elled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP; Fig.1, right) can be written as follows:

The canonical neural network [17,18] is mathematically equivalent to variational Bayes in this setting,
enabling the empirical estimates of VFE, Bayesian surprise, and accuracy directly from the recorded
activity.
The generative process comprised two independent binary signal sourcess(1) ands(2), which stochas-
tically generated 32 binary observations through a 0.75/0.25 likelihood mapping across channel halves.
Each observation was delivered to the culture as an electrical pulse (Fig.1, left). One experiment consisted

sessions (see Methods ’Electrophysiological experiment’ section for details).
Perceptual inference by neuronal networks
We conducted 27 independent experiments across 12 cultures using an HD-MEA (26,400 electrodes;
up to 1,024 recorded simultaneously at a sampling rate of 20 kHz; 32 stimulation channels and≤992
recording channels). Spike rasters and PSTHs at a representative electrode revealed source-selective
responses that strengthened progressively from session 1 to session 100 (Fig.2a). Across electrodes and
experiments, spike counts peaked around 100–200 ms post-stimulation; thus, the number of spikes within
a 10–300 ms window was defined as the evoked response (Fig.2b). Across electrodes, the Kullback-
Leibler divergence (KLD) of the responses between(s(1),s(2)) = (1,0)and(s (1),s(2)) = (0,1)increased
significantly (Fig.2c). Moreover, when tracking the changes in the average evoked responses ofs(1)-

in whichs (1) was active, demonstrating the emergence and reinforcement of source selectivity under

repeated, source-generated stimulation (Fig.2d). Together, these findings indicate perceptual inference
by neuronal networks: the cultures became sensitive to the hidden signal sources’ states despite receiving
probabilistically generated electrical stimulation.
Canonical neural network and variational Bayesian inference
We formalized the inference using a canonical neural network [17,18] (Fig.3a), which is mathematically
equivalent to variational Bayesian inference under the POMDP (Fig.1, right). This formulation allowed
empirical evaluation of VFE, its complexity term (Bayesian surprise), and accuracy from recorded neu-
ronal responses and inferred parameters (see Methods ’FEP-based analysis’ section for details). Across ex-
periments, VFE decreased, whereas both Bayesian surprise and accuracy increased significantly (Fig.3b–
3d), consistent with self-organization under the FEP and reflecting enhanced belief updating and model
complexity. We further decomposed Bayesian surprise by source and found it to be selectively larger
for the currently true source (two-sided binomial sign tests; Fig.3e). Moreover, Bayesian surprise was
strongly coupled to response diversity quantified by the session-wise interquartile range (IQR) of evoked
activity (meanρ= 0.777, 95% CI [0.678, 0.848],τ2 = 0.302,Q= 634.5andI 2 = 95.9; meta-analysis on
Spearman correlations under a random-effects model; Fig.3f, 3g).

outside the main complex (Wilcoxon signed-rank test;n= 2,700session pairs) (Fig.4g–4i). Together,
these results indicate that higher integrated information is accompanied by larger informational cores
that concentrate diverse neuronal activity.

information rises in tandem with belief updating, while model efficiency (i.e., low VFE) does not map
ontoΦ mc
R in a straightforward manner.
Finally, the contrast in coreness betweens(1)- ands(2)-preferring electrodes tracked the contrast in
source-specific Bayesian surprise (meanρ= 0.531, 95% CI [0.373, 0.660],Q= 616.3,I 2 = 95.8, and
τ2 = 0.270; Fig.5g, 5h). In other words, stronger belief updating coincided with greater contributions
to informational cores, linking the content of inference to the geography of integration within the same
network.
Discussion
Summary of main findings
We investigated how integrated information (Φmc
R and coreness) behaves when cultured cortical networks
perform perceptual inference formalized under variational Bayes, or the free-energy principle (FEP).
Consistent with prior work [16,17,19], repeated presentation of observations generated by hidden sources
elicited robust source selectivity, demonstrating the emergence of perceptual inference inin vitroneuronal
networks (Fig.2). Session-wise analyses showed that variational free energy (VFE) decreased, while
Bayesian surprise (complexity) and accuracy increased, consistent with self-organization under the FEP
(Fig.3b–3d).
At the network level,Φmc
R and main-complex size followed a hill-shaped trajectory across sessions and
were positively correlated (Fig.4c–4f). Informational cores concentrated diverse neuronal activity: mean
coreness positively correlated with the session-wise interquartile range (IQR) of evoked responses, and
the mean IQR of electrodes inside the main complex consistently exceeded that of electrodes outside
(Fig.4g–4i).
Across experiments,Φmc
R correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, showed a modest
and heterogeneous correlation with accuracy, and exhibited no significant overall relationship with VFE
(Fig.5a–5f). Moreover, the spatial allocation of belief updating predicted the geography of informational
cores: coreness contrasts mirrored source-specific Bayesian surprise contrasts (Fig.5g, 5h). Taken to-
gether, these findings suggest that integrated informational structure during FEP-guided self-organization
increases specifically when beliefs are being updated and sensory inputs are most informative, rather than
directly reflecting model efficiency. In this way, our results provide empirical evidence bridging IIT and
the FEP, linking the intrinsic structure of experience with the adaptive dynamics of inference.

Integrated information and Bayesian surprise
A central observation is the robust positive association betweenΦmc
R and Bayesian surprise across sessions
and experiments (meta-analytic Spearman’sρ= 0.879; Fig.5c, 5d). Bayesian surprise quantifies the
divergence between the priorP(s)and the variational posteriorQ(s)≈P(s|o), i.e., the degree of belief
updating elicited by new evidence. When belief change is small—because the current generative model
already explains inputs with high likelihood—processing can rely on pre-existing, localized, relatively
reflexive circuits with lower irreducibility. By contrast, when belief change is large, the model must be
reconstructed, yielding distributed and synergistic activity patterns that span subnetworks and increase
integratedinformation. Thismechanisticpicturealignswiththesession-wiseincreaseinresponsediversity

Figure 6:Proposed framework
Schematic of the proposed behavior of integrated information during self-organization under the FEP. As
VFE decreases over time, integrated information is predicted to follow a hill-shaped trajectory, reaching
a maximum at intermediate stages characterized by complex recurrent connectivity. Networks thus
transition from chaotic connections to more orderly structures. This trajectory parallels exploration
versus exploitation, and mutation versus selection in Darwinian dynamics. The previously reported
decrease in surprise with increasingΦover evolutionary timescales [15] may reflect the ascending phase
of this trajectory.

complex size andΦmc
R (meanρ= 0.411; Fig.4e, 4f), and the consistently higher IQR inside than outside
the main complex (Fig.4g–4i). Thus, diverse and widely coupled dynamics are likely to accompany belief
revision and covary withΦ. Functionally, because sustaining largeΦentails substantial spatial and
metabolic costs, it is expected to emerge primarily when these costs are offset by highly informative
inputs, as reflected in high Bayesian surprise.
Response diversity, quantified as the session-wise IQR of evoked responses, tracked Bayesian surprise
across experiments (meanρ= 0.879; Fig.3f, 3g). This result is consistent with operation near critical-
ity [25–29], a regime in which neural systems maximize dynamic range and stimulus–response mutual
information,I(S;R), while exhibiting rich long-range correlations. WhenQ(s)approximatesP(s|o)
and is averaged over observations, Bayesian surprise relates to the mutual information between observa-
tions and hidden states,I(o;s). Because observationsocorrespond to stimuli and beliefs about hidden
statessare encoded in neural responses, increases inI(S;R)near criticality can enhance bothI(o;s)and
Bayesian surprise. Given the theoretical and empirical predictions that integrated informationΦpeaks
near criticality [30–33], together with our findings of positive IQR–coreness covariation and consistently
higher IQR inside than outside the main complex (Fig.4g–4i), the observed positive correlation between
Φand Bayesian surprise appears to share a common foundation in criticality—where diverse activity is
globally coordinated without loss of differentiation.
Importantly, Bayesian surprise accords with the intrinsicality emphasized by IIT. Integrated infor-
9
mation structure is fundamentally intrinsic—as in dreaming—but can be modulated by external stimuli.
Bayesian surprise is defined solely in terms of internal elements, the priorP(s)and the variational pos-
teriorQ(s), yet depends implicitly on external observationsothroughQ(s)≈P(s|o). This perspective
aligns with IIT’s claim that integrated information reflects meaningful intrinsic cause–effect power, rather
than the extrinsic Shannon-style messages or codes [34].
Assuming thatΦunderlies consciousness, its coupling with Bayesian surprise offers a unifying account
of diverse experiential phenomena. In motor adaptation, such as learning to play an instrument, the early
stages involve awkward movements and vivid sensations (highΦ) because internal models fail to predict
inputs and require reorganization (high Bayesian surprise). With practice, performance becomes fluent;
prediction improves, belief updating diminishes, and phenomenological vividness decreases (lowΦand
Bayesian surprise). A similar trajectory is seen in perceptual adaptation, as in glare adjustment or Troxler
fading. The framework also explains why most spontaneous neural activity remains unconscious: such
fluctuations yield no new knowledge, elicit little belief updating, and are not integrated. By the same
logic, pathological experiences—such as hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia, associated with
aberrant salience [35]—may reflect abnormal assignment of Bayesian surprise, which is closely related
to salience [36]. In such cases, trivial inputs are treated as highly informative, driving excessive belief
updating and distortingΦ–structure. Thus, across normal learning, adaptation, spontaneous activity,
and pathology,Φappears to index the informativeness of sensory evidence through its dependence on
belief updating.
Integrated information and accuracy
Overall, accuracy showed a significant but heterogeneous positive relationship withΦmc
R (meanρ= 0.393;
Fig.5e, 5f). This suggests that greater integration often accompanies better inference performance, yet
high accuracy is not strictly contingent on largeΦmc
R : 7/27 experiments exhibited negative correlations.
These results are consistent with the view that richΦ–structures confer functional advantages [37,38],
while also aligning with IIT’s prediction that functionally equivalent systems can differ in their integrated
causal structure [4,5]. This dovetails with our observation thatΦis tightly coupled to belief updating
(complexity) rather than to performance per se. Three analogies illustrate this dissociation: Bayesian
surprise vs. accuracy, model parameter count vs. performance, and intrinsic integrated information vs.
extrinsic functionality. In each case, the former contributes to the latter but it is not strictly required.
Integrated information and variational free energy
Empirically, theΦmc
R –VFE relationship was mixed across experiments and not significant overall (mean
ρ= 0.345; CI crosses zero; Fig.5a, 5b). To reconcile this with reports thatΦincreases as surprise falls over
longer (evolutionary) timescales [15] and with the theoretical accounts suggesting that minimizing VFE
may entail maximizingΦ[13,14], here we newly propose a hill-shaped trajectory: as VFE decreases,
Φinitially rises, peaks, and then declines (conceptual Fig.6). This scheme accords with the observed
hill-shaped transitions ofΦ mc
R and main-complex size (Fig.4c, 4d). Under such a trajectory,Φ–VFE
correlations can be positive or negative, depending on whether the system resides on the ascending or
descending slope. This framework thus accommodates the variability observed across experiments while
situating the negative relations reported in theory [13,14] and in evolutionary simulations [15] within the
ascending phase, without contradicting our findings.
At a high VFE (a maladapted regime), the entropy of observations tends to be large—under ergodicity,
the long-term average of VFE serves as an upper bound on observation entropy [39]—so behavior becomes
weakly structured and elements act almost independently. Integrated information is presumably low
owingtotheabsenceofthecause–effectpoweremphasizedbyIIT—conceptually, ahigh-entropy“gas-like”
network. At a very low VFE (an idealized limit), the agent’s generative model would predict perfectly and
processing would become reflexive and feedforward, with minimal belief updating. Integrated information
should again be low, both because of the spatial and metabolic cost of maintaining it and the absence
of recurrence—conceptually, a low-entropy “solid-like” network. Between these extremes, the model is
competent yet uncertainty remains. Multiple competing hypotheses must be coordinated and revised
by ongoing input, fostering large recurrent cause–effect structures and highΦ—conceptually, a medium-
entropy “liquid-like” network.
Functionally, this hill-shaped trajectory can be interpreted as a progression from the exploration
10
(mutation) phase to the exploitation (selection) phase. Early in training, because high-Φsystems coincide
with information harvesting—high Bayesian surprise, related to the mutual informationI(o;s)—where
substantial resources are invested to construct large integrated cores and explore models capable of
explainingtheinputswithsufficientlikelihood. Later, asthemodelcompressesandstabilizes, exploitation
dominates: Bayesian surprise andΦsubside while VFE continues to decline. A similar interpretation
applies to mutation–selection metaphors in the neural Darwinism-like dynamics [40–42]: early training
expands the responsive area and diversifies neural responses (presumably higherΦ), whereas later training
contracts the area and stereotypes responses (lowerΦ) even as performance improves [42]. Together, these
analyses suggest thatΦis not a direct proxy for model efficiency. Instead, it peaks during phases of belief
revision embedded within longer-term free-energy descent.
Limitations of the present study
First, the proposed hill-shaped trajectory ofΦis an idealized principle whose full expression is constrained
in practice. Embodiment, bodily degrees of freedom, and environmental complexity often prolong devel-
opment, such that a post-developmental state with diminishedΦmay rarely be reached outside of simple
tasks. Ourin vitro, low-difficulty task with two binary hidden states likely enabled some cultures to
reach this exploitative regime. Because the preparation was disembodied and passively stimulated, the
exploratory stage was probably shorter than would occur in an embodied setting. In active inference,
agents minimize expected free energy, which includes the epistemic-value term (expected Bayesian sur-
prise) with a negative sign [43,44], thereby promoting exploration, sustaining higher Bayesian surprise,
and maintaining largerΦduring active sensing, as in daily active vision [45]. Second,Φwas approxi-
mated usingΦ R [20] and coreness with a minimum-cut-based method [21,22]. These are IIT-inspired
proxies rather than full IIT 3.0/4.0 quantifications. Our approaches emphasize synergistic coupling but
do not exhaustively assess state-dependent cause–effect structures across spatiotemporal scales [5]. Third,
methodological constraints required us to fix the timescale (τ= 10ms), treat each electrode as a unit,
and to estimate transitions primarily from stimulation (perturbational) trials. While these approxima-
tions are likely reasonable—given the emergence of integrated information at the macro timescale in
actual neural recordings [46] and the characteristic timescales of cultured neurons [47,48]—they remain
scale-dependent and warrant cautious interpretation. Finally, substantial between-experiment hetero-
geneity (highQ, highI2) in several meta-analyses cautions that culture-specific factors (e.g., maturation,
connectivity, excitability) may modulate the coupling betweenΦ, Bayesian surprise, and performance.
Conclusion
Ourresultsshowthat, inlivingneuronalnetworksperformingperceptualinference, integratedinformation
is tightly coupled to belief updating—indexed by Bayesian surprise—rather than directly to variational
free energy. Informational cores expand and concentrate diverse activity when belief revision is stronger,
and aΦ-proxy follows a hill-shaped trajectory across learning sessions, peaking within long-term free-
energy descent. These dynamics are consistent with operation near criticality, where response diversity,
belief updating, and integrated information co-peak. Conceptually,Φcan be interpreted as the intrinsic
manifestation of system reorganization required to incorporate informative evidence; once the generative
model becomes sufficiently complete,Φis expected to decline. Functionally,Φdoes not directly enhance
inference performance but indirectly facilitates it by supporting model updates. By situating integrated
information within belief updating, our findings empirically link IIT’s mechanistic account with the FEP’s
functional perspective, advancing a unified framework that bridges the proximate “how” and the ultimate
“why” of consciousness.
Methods
Dissociated neuronal cultures
All procedures complied with the “Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Animals in the Field of
Physiological Science” published by the Japanese Physiological Society. The Committee on the Ethics of
11
Animal Experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of
Tokyo, approved the experimental protocol (A2024IST003).
High-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs, MaxOne, MaxWell Biosystems) were covered with 1
mL of 1% Tergazyme (Sigma-Aldrich) and left at room temperature for 2 h. The detergent was removed
with an aspirator, and the chips were rinsed three times with sterilized water. Each chip was subsequently
soaked in ethanol for 30 min, rinsed three additional times, overlaid with 1 mL of pre-warmed plating
medium (Neurobasal Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific), covered to prevent drying, and maintained in an
incubator for at least 2 days.
After this pretreatment, the chips were rinsed three times with sterile water. Polyethylenimine (Su-
pelco) was diluted to 0.07 % in borate buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 50µL were applied to each
electrode surface. The chips were incubated overnight, washed three times and then coated with 50µL
of laminin (20µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). After replacing the lids, the chips were incubated for 1 h.
Pregnant Wistar rats were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (Viatris) and euthanised by guillotine
decapitation. Following abdominal disinfection with ethanol, the uterus was removed and placed in
Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies). Three E18 fetuses were harvested, their brains were
removed, and pieces of cerebral cortex were excised for cell seeding.
The cortical tissue was transferred to 2 mL of 0.25 % Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and incubated for 20 min, with the tube shaken every 5 min. The tissue was then transferred to plating
medium to stop the enzymatic reaction, gently shaken, and placed in fresh medium. Cells were dissociated
with trituration pipetting. One milliliter of the suspension was passed through a 40µm cell strainer
(Falcon). Plating medium was added to adjust the density to 38,000 cells per 5µL.
The laminin solution was removed from the chip surface, and 50µL of the cell suspension was applied
onto the electrodes. The chip was incubated for 120 min to allow cell attachment, after which 0.6 mL
of plating medium was added. The chip was then maintained in the incubator. To prevent evaporation,
the chip was covered with its lid, placed with a 35 mm dish of sterilized water inside a 90 mm dish, and
kept in an incubator at 36.5°C in 5 % CO2.
In this study, 12 independent cell cultures were used to conduct 27 independent experiments. The
average days in vitro (DIV) was18.4±6.96.
Electrophysiological experiments
HD-MEAs were used both to record the activity of cultured neuronal networks and to deliver electrical
stimulation. The HD-MEA employed in this study contained 26,400 electrodes arranged within an area
of 3.85 mm×2.10 mm, with 17.5-µm spacing between electrodes, of which up to 1,024 could be recorded
simultaneously at a sampling rate of 20 kHz [49,50]. Prior to experiments, spontaneous activity was
recorded from all electrodes for 50 s. Based on the average spike amplitude during this period, up to
1,024 electrodes with the highest amplitudes were selected for subsequent recordings. From this set,
the 32 electrodes with the highest average spike amplitudes were designated as stimulation electrodes.
Among them, the 16 electrodes with odd-numbered amplitude ranks delivered stimulation corresponding
to observationso (1) −o(16), while the 16 electrodes with even-numbered ranks delivered stimulation
corresponding to observationso (17) −o(32). Because recordings from the stimulation electrodes were
prone to noise interference, subsequent recordings were obtained from up to 992 electrodes, excluding
these 32 stimulation electrodes. Electrical stimulation consisted of biphasic pulses with a positive-first
phase, an amplitude of 350 mV, and a pulse width of 200µs.
Data processing
For spike detection, the recorded potentials were band-pass filtered (300–3000 Hz, Butterworth filter). A
spike was detected when the measured potential at an electrode fell below a threshold set at five times
the standard deviation of the potential for that electrode.
In our samples, spike counts peaked within 100–200 ms after electrical stimulation (Fig.2b). Accord-
ingly, the evoked response strengthrti at an electrodeiin a trialtwas defined as the number of spikes
occurring within a 10–300 ms window post-stimulation.
This treatment of evoked responses closely followed that of previous studies [16,19]; readers are
referred to those works for further details. For trials in which the source state was(s(1),s(2)) = (1,0)
(approximately 6,400 trials (= 100sessions×256trials/session/4states)), the meanr ti was computed,
12
as well as for trials in which(s(1),s(2)) = (0,1)(∼6,400 trials). The difference between these two means
was then calculated for each electrode. Electrodes with differences>0were classified ass(1)-preferring,
those with differences<0ass (2)-preferring, and those with differences= 0as non-preferring/inactive.
The numbers ofs(1)-preferring,s(2)-preferring, and non-preferring/inactive electrodes were352.0±359.3,
353.1±347.5, and287.7±311.0, respectively (n= 27).
For each trial, the mean evoked response over thes(1)-preferring electrodes was computed asxt1, and
the mean over thes(2)-preferring asxt2. Bothx t1 andx t2 were then mean-subtracted, detrended, and
normalized to the range[0,1].
KLD of neuronal response
To evaluate the source selectivity of neuronal responses at each electrode, we used the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD) method introduced in a previous study [16]. For electrodei, the distributions of
evoked spike counts in(s(1),s(2)) = (1,0)and(0,1)trials were each fitted with a Poisson distribution.
The empirical parametersλ1,0 andλ 0,1 were estimated, and the KLD was computed according to the
following equation:
DKL(P(ri |(1,0))∥P(r i |(0,1))) =λ 1,0 ln λ1,0
λ0,1
+λ0,1 −λ1,0.
In the Results, we report analyses restricted to the 7,613 electrodes for which the computed KLD
values converged (i.e., did not diverge).
FEP-based analysis
For FEP-based analysis, we closely followed the methods described in previous studies [17–19], including
the generative process, variational Bayesian inference, the canonical neural network, and the reverse-
engineering framework. For mathematical details, readers are referred to those prior studies.
Generative process of observations
We assumed a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in which two independent binary
hidden sourcess t = (s(1)
t ,s(2)
t )∈{0,1} 2, generated 32 binary sensory observations,ot ∈{0,1} 32, via
a stochastic mixing matrixA. In the actual experiment, the state of each hidden source was drawn
independently from a Bernoulli distribution with probability 0.5. For each observation channel, the
observation was generated from the hidden sources with specific conditional probabilities. In particular,
o(1) −o(16) conveyed the value ofs(1) with probability 0.75 or that ofs(2) with probability 0.25; conversely,
o(17) −o(32) conveyed the value ofs(2) with probability 0.75 or that ofs(1) with probability 0.25. This
defined the categorical likelihoodP(o(i)
t |st,A)for each electrode, withP(A(i))assigned a Dirichlet prior.
Variational free energy

Canonical neural network formulation
Neuronal responsesxt ∈(0,1) 2 to sensory inputsot were modelled as a canonical neural network with
the following dynamics:
˙xt ∝−sig −1(xt) +Wot +h,
wheresig −1(·)is the elementwise logit function,Wis a2×32synaptic strength matrix, andhis the
adaptive firing threshold vector. The matrixW=W1 −W0 is composed of excitatory (W1) and inhibitory
(W0) components.

Reverse engineering from empirical neural activity

where⟨·⟩indicates the average over time. The threshold factorϕwas held constant within each session.
Following previous studies,ϕfor the first 10 sessions was computed as the average of the neuronal
responses during those sessions. For subsequent sessions,ϕwas computed as the average of the neuronal
responses in the immediately preceding session.

Neuronal response IQR
To evaluate the variability of neuronal responses, we used the interquartile range (IQR). For each session,
the mean evoked responser(1) ofs (1)-preferring electrodes was grouped by hidden source state, and the
IQR was calculated within each group. These IQR values were then averaged. The same procedure was
applied tor(2) ofs(2)-preferring electrodes. The two resulting IQRs were then averaged to yield an overall
measure of response diversity for the network.
Similarly, to assess the variability of neuronal responses at a single electrode, trials were grouped by
hidden source state, and the IQR was calculated within each group and then averaged.
14
Transition probability
In IIT, the cause–effect power is evaluated from the transition probabilities between system states. The
method used here corresponds to what has previously been referred to as the downsampling method [46].
Specifically, the time series was coarse-grained into states by segmenting it into windows of widthτ, and
the empirical distribution of state transitions between adjacent windows was computed. For a time series
of lengthT, there areT−τ+ 1such windows, each represented by the mean value of the observations
within that window. These representative values were binarized using their median as the threshold.
Adjacent pairs of windows yieldT−2τ+ 1transitions, which were used to compute state transition
probabilities. In each trial, evoked responses during 10–300 ms after stimulation were binned at 1-ms
resolution, resulting in a time series of length 290. For each session, a single state transition probabil-
ity matrix was computed using all trials in which electrical stimulation was delivered, i.e., those with
(s(1),s(2))̸= (0,0), amounting to approximately 256×3/4=192 trials. The use of only trials containing
stimulation followed the rationale of the perturbational approach.
Complex extraction
For each session, a weighted undirected graph was constructed in which each vertex represented a pre-
ferring electrode, and all vertices were fully connected. The weight of each edge was given byΦR [20],
computed from the neuronal activity of the corresponding pair. The number of vertices occasionally
reached∼900. Due to computational constraints,τwas fixed at 10 ms, and state transition probabilities
were calculated for all electrode pairs;ΦR values were then derived from these transition probabilities.
The 10-ms window width was chosen based on the time step used in the previous studies of spatiotemporal
patterns in neuronal cultures [47,48]. TheΦR between electrodesXandYwas expressed as:
ΦR(X,Y) =I(X t−1,Yt−1;Xt,Yt)−I(X t−1;Xt)−I(Y t−1;Yt) + min
Z=X,Y,W=X,Y
I(Zt−1;Wt),
whereIis Shannon’s mutual information, and the fourth term corresponds to the minimum mutual
information (MMI) [51] redundancy function, introduced as a corrective measure to avoid negative values.
The method of complex extraction followed that described in previous research [21], and mathematical
details are provided therein. The graph was recursively partitioned using the minimum cut (mc) until all
vertices were isolated. Given a vertex set, the minimum cut is defined as the bipartition of the set into
two non-empty, disjoint subsets that minimizes the sum of the edge weights crossing the partition. The
sum of these edge weights crossing the minimum cut of a vertex set was denotedΦmc
R for that set. A
vertex set was defined as a complex if itsΦmc
R was greater than that of any of its supersets, and, among
such complexes, was further defined as a main complex if itsΦmc
R was not smaller than that of any of its
subsets. The maximumΦmc
R among main complexes — analogous to the integrated information quantity
in IIT 2.0 — was taken as the index of integrated information in this study. This index was computed
once per session. Finally,Φ mc
R was normalized by the number of edges in the graph. This adjustment
was necessary because, for two graphs with comparable average edge weights but different numbers of
vertices, the graph with more vertices and edges would naturally yield a larger number of edges crossing
a cut, and thus a largerΦmc
R . Normalization by edge count therefore enabled comparisons across graphs
of different sizes.
Additionally, we computed the coreness measure [22]. For a given graph, the coreness of a vertex is
defined as the maximumΦmc
R among all complexes that include that vertex (noting that the set of all
vertices always constitutes at least one complex). In previous work [22], coreness was computed for the
mouse connectome and found to be high in regions such as the cerebral cortex, which are conducive to
large integrated information, and low in regions such as the cerebellum, which are less suited for inte-
grated information. Thus, coreness quantifies the contribution of each vertex to the system’s integrated
information.
Statistical tests
For comparisons between two paired groups, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. For the meta-
analysis of Spearman correlation coefficientsρi obtained from each experiment, values were first trans-
formed into the Fisher-zdomain:z i = 1
2 ln 1+ρi
1−ρi
.Sampling variances were approximated asVar(zi)≈
15
(1+ρ2
i/2)/(n−3)[52], wherendenotes the number of paired observations (i.e., the number of data points
per experiment contributing to the correlation). Between-experiment heterogeneity was assessed using
Cochran’sQstatistic and theI 2 statistic [53]. Given the presence of heterogeneity, we estimated pooled
effects using a random-effects model with DerSimonian–Laird estimation [54] of the between-experiment
varianceτ 2. Random-effects weights were defined aswi = 1/(Var(zi) +τ 2), and the pooled effect size
was computed aszRE = ∑
iwizi/∑
iwi. The corresponding standard error was SERE =
√
1/∑
iwi
and p-values were obtained from the two-sidedZ-test. Finally,z RE and the 95% confidence interval
zRE ±1.96SE RE were back-transformed to the correlation scale usingρ= tanh(z). Random-effects
estimates, together with heterogeneity statistics (Q,I2, andτ2), are reported in the Results.
