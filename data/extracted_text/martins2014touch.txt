Touch attention Bayesian models for robotic
active haptic exploration of heterogeneous surfaces
Ricardo Martins, Jo ˜ao Filipe Ferreira, Member, IEEE, Jorge Dias, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract— This work contributes to the development of active
haptic exploration strategies of surfaces using robotic hands
in environments with an unknown structure. The architecture
of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian models,
implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system.
The model πper perceives and discriminates different cate-
gories of materials (haptic stimulus) integrating compliance
and texture features extracted from haptic sensory data. The
model πtar actively infers the next region of the workspace that
should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task
information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty
maps extracted from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well
as, inhibition-of-return mechanisms.
The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian
model πper can be used to discriminate 10 different classes
of materials with an average recognition rate higher than
90%. The generalization capability of the proposed models
was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the
simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity
between two regions made of different materials with a diver-
gence smaller than 1cm (30 trials). The tests were performed
in scenarios with 3 different conﬁgurations of the discontinuity.
The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to
manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces
and sensory noise to make correct motor decisions from haptic
percepts.
I. I NTRODUCTION
The diversity of the sensory and actuation apparatus of
the new generation of robotic systems [1] provides the
support required to introduce these platforms in complex
and dynamic environments (eg: domestic tasks, healthcare
services, entertainment). To deal with the high diversity of
environmental noisy sensory signals and uncertainties associ-
ated with the structure of these scenarios, those robotic plat-
forms are endowed with active perception and action systems
arranged in action-perception loop architectures [2]. The
integration of attention mechanisms in those architectures
contributes to the increasing of the efﬁciency of the action-
perception loop process. Attention mechanisms integrate the
saliency of the different sensory stimulus according to the
task objectives and assist the decision making. In robotics,
attention mechanisms have been predominantly applied to
vision and audition sensory domains [3].
Robotic haptic exploration [4] integrates haptic sensorial
inputs (force, torque, tactile and temperature sensing) to

perform tasks which are mainly involved in environments
with low visibility conditions or partially occluded (un-
derwater robotic manipulation, smoky and foggy disaster
environments), in service robotic platforms without vision
systems or to complement vision systems information (eg:
ﬁnd, follow and extract the contour and structure of a napkin
in the top of a table to subsequent grasping task).
This work proposes a formulation of Bayesian models
implementing touch attention mechanisms involved in the
active haptic exploration of unknown surfaces by generic
robotic hands and sensory apparatus. The deﬁnition of the
architecture of the Bayesian models, haptic sensory data
processing pipeline, follows the principles described in the
human anatomo-physiology studies [5] [6] and on how
humans manage uncertainty [2] to make motor decisions
from percepts [7].
II. R ELATED WORKS
The recent developments and improvements [8] [4] veri-
ﬁed in the haptic sensing technologies (tactile, force, temper-
ature) have promoted the intensive integration of these types
of sensing technologies in the new generation of dexterous
robotic hands, as presented in [9]. Due to the diversity of
technologies and application ﬁelds, very distinct approaches
and objectives have been followed to perform the robotic
exploration of surfaces using haptic sensory inputs.
Some approaches perform the haptic exploration of sur-
faces with the objective of achieving a categorization of the
surfaces or objects. The exploration is performed locally,
assuming that the explored object is homogeneous or uniform
in terms of the haptic features under analysis, such as the
surface curvature [10], texture [11] [12] [13] [14], compli-
ance [15] [12], stickiness [16] and thermal conductivity [12]
[17]. This work contributes to this group of approaches by
proposing a Bayesian model to discriminate 10 categories

with noise .
A second class of works integrates sensing, perception
and local exploration mechanisms similar to the previous
works, however they expand the exploration strategy to large
and heterogeneous surfaces in the haptic features domain
under analysis. The perceptual haptic map of the surface
can be constructed following different strategies: the global
exploration path is ﬁxed and deﬁned a-priori [18] [19]
[20], the exploration is performed actively showing a active
behaviour [21], [22]. This work contributes to this class of
approaches by proposing a formulation of Bayesian models
implementing touch attention mechanisms involved in the
active haptic exploration of unknown surfaces. Once this
work assumes that the workspace is unknown a-priori to
the system, the exploration path is adapted actively by the
touch attention mechanisms. This implementation strategy
provides to the system the ability to deal with ambiguous
sensory signals corrupted with noise and perform the active
haptic exploration of surfaces with different geometries.
III. P ROBLEM FORMULATION AND APPROACH OVERVIEW
The main objective of a haptic exploration task consists in
the determination of the sequence of states that the robotic
system should follow to fulﬁl the objectives of the task. In
the formulation of this work we assume that the exploration
task is performed by a generic robotic system. Thus, the
solution to the haptic exploration task is described in the tri-
dimensional Cartesian space, by progressively determining
the sequence of regions of the workspace that should be

u that are the lower and upper limits of the X, Y,

the robotic platform is partitioned in an isometric 3D grid
(cubic voxels), as represented in ﬁgure 1. Each elementary
cubic voxel vk has a side of dimension ε, is described by
a 3D Cartesian location (x,y,z ) expressed in the inertial
world referential {W} and can be associated to a random
variable (inference grid), as will be presented throughout this
manuscript.
Although the internal structure and conﬁguration of the
haptic stimulus disposed in the workspace is unknown a-
priori to the robotic system, the ground truth describing the
target locations of the workspace that should be visited by
the robotic platform during the task execution, can be for-
mulated by an human operator for benchmark purposes and
represented by B= {b1,b2,b3,..., bk}, bi = ( x,y,z ) ∈

platform during the task execution can be represented by
V= {v1,v2,v3,..., vl}, vi = (x,y,z ) ∈R3.
The performance of the execution of the task by the robotic
platform during an experimental trial can be evaluated by an
error metric deﬁned in equation 1.

Better autonomous exploration strategies provide lower
values of Γ. This metric determines the total divergence be-
tween the exploration path executed by the robotic platform
Vand the benchmark path Bdeﬁned by an external operator.
The deﬁnition of this metric follows the same principles of
analogous metrics proposed by [22] and [20].
The global structure of the approach proposed in this work
is presented in ﬁgure 2, arranged in a action-perception loop
architecture. The haptic perception for action side of the loop
integrates the Bayesian model πper:”Perception of haptic
stimulus map”, while the action for haptic perception side
of the loop integrates the Bayesian model πtar:”Selection of
the next exploration target”. The main variables involved in
this work are summarized in table I.
IV. P ERCEPTION OF HAPTIC STIMULUS MAP
A. Random variables of the model
Based on the sensory haptic inputs acquired at v, at
each time iteration step k, the model πper implemented
in this Bayesian program determines the perceived cate-
gory of material of the voxel v of the workspace. This
work considers that the robotic system has the capability
to perceive and discriminate n = 10 classes of different
materials (haptic stimulus). The random variable M(v,k) =
”Material category of v” can be deﬁned as follows:
M(v,k) ∈{Material1,...,Material 10} (2)
We will consider the same set of materials that was
used in the work [12]. These 10 reference materials cor-
respond to samples of acrylic, brick, copper, damp sponge,
feather, rough foam, plush toy, silicone, soft foam, wood,
respectively. These categories of materials are characterized
by different properties of texture, compliance and thermal
conductivity that were extracted using BioTac biomimetic
tactile sensor raw data (contact intensity, vibration, heat
ﬂow). In this work we will only consider the texture and
compliance properties of the materials.
The description of the texture and compliance properties
of the region v of the workspace is represented by the
random variables E(v,k) = ”Texture characterization of v”
and C(v,k) = ”Compliance characterization of v” respec-
tively, E(v,k) = f(h(v,k)), C(v,k) = g(h(v,k)). The parameter
h(v,k) represents haptic sensing measurements provided by
the sensory apparatus of the robotic platform. The function
g transforms the haptic sensing measurements h(v,k) in a
compliance characterization of the explored surface, while f
transforms h(v,k) in a texture characterization of the surface.
B. Inference of the haptic stimulus category
The statistical independence relations between
E(v,k),C(v,k),M(v,k) are expressed in ﬁgure 3 a). Based
on those statistical assumptions, the joint probability
distribution function P(E(v,k),C(v,k),M(v,k),πper) is
decomposed as described in ﬁgure 3 b). Each of those
factors follows a probability distribution function presented
in ﬁgure 3 b). At each time iteration step, based on the
observed data e(v,k),c(v,k), the Bayesian program described
in ﬁgure 3 b) is run with the question presented in equation
3.

rials. Data extracted from [12].
C. Determination of P(E(v,k)|M(v,k),πper) and
P(C(v,k)|M(v,k),πper)
The free parameters µE(M), σE(M), µC(M), σC(M)
of the Gaussian functions used to deﬁne the Nor-
mal probability distributions P(E(v,k)|M(v,k),πper) and
P(C(v,k)|M(v,k),πper) are estimated during experimental
learning sessions. As described in [12], during the learning
period, standard exploration procedures are performed for
each of the n = 10 reference materials. After the pre-
determined number of standard explorations, the free param-
eters µE(M), σE(M), µC(M), σC(M) of the Normal ( N)
distributions are determined by calculating the average and
standard deviation of E and C for each reference material.
The results are represented in the ﬁgures 4 a) and 4 b),
extracting the data available from the work [12].
V. S ELECTION OF THE NEXT EXPLORATION TARGET
A. Random variables of the model
Based on the haptic stimulus M(v,k) map perceived dur-
ing the exploration of v ( previous section IV), at each
time iteration step k, the model πtar implemented in this
Bayesian program determines the next region of workspace
that should be explored by the robotic system. This tar-
get is represented by the discrete random variable Ok −
”Next workspace region to be explored”, given that Ok ∈
{v1,v2,v3,...,v θ}. θ is the total number of voxels in
the grid representation of the workspace. vi is a compact
representation of the voxel identiﬁer.
The selection of Ok is conditioned by inhibition-of-return
mechanisms. The inhibition level imposed by inhibition-of-
return process involved in the touch attention mechanisms
is implemented by the continuous random variable I(v,k) −
”Inhibition level for voxel v.”.
I(v,k) = 1 −Θdα−1(1 −d)1−β, I (v,k) ∈[0,1] (4)
In this work, due to the characteristics of the haptic
exploration procedures presented in section I, the inhibition
of return process promotes, at time iteration k+1, the explo-
ration of regions of the workspace different from the current
position of the end-effector of the robotic system ( ˆok−1).
However, simultaneously, the inhibition-of-return process
inhibits the exploration of regions too distant from ˆok−1,
to avoid discontinuities in search and following exploration
tasks. The inhibition levels I(v,k) for each voxel v can be
described by the equation 4, considering α = 1 .01 and
β = 9 (proﬁle represented in ﬁgure 6 a)). The parameter d
is determined by d= dk/dmax. The parameter dk expresses
the Euclidean distance between ok and ˆok−1 and dmax
is a constant representing the maximum possible distance
between ok and ˆok−1 for the workspace dimensions. Θ is
a normalization constant. The values of I(v,k)(d) are ranged
between 0 and 1. I(v,k) = 0 indicates that the inhibition-of-
return mechanism applies no inhibition to voxel v, whereas
I(v,k) = 1 indicates a full inhibition to voxel v.

Fig. 5: Bayesianl model πtar:”Selection of the next explo-
ration target”. a) Graphical representation. b) Description of
the Bayesian program.
The selection of the region Ok of the workspace is also
dependent of mechanisms to avoid the return to regions
already explored and perceived with low uncertainty. In this
work, those mechanisms are represented by the continuous
random variable U(v,k) −”Uncertainty level for voxel v.”,
described in equation 5. The operator H determines the
entropy of the discrete random variable M(v,k).
U(v,k) = H(M(v,k))
max(H(M(v,k))), U (v,k) ∈[0,1] (5)
Another factor conditioning the determination of Ok is
the saliency of the haptic stimulus perceived in the region
v of the workspace and in its surroundings. Besides de-
pending on the perceived haptic stimulus M(v,k) map, the
formulation of the saliency of those haptic stimulus is also
dependent of the current objectives of the exploration task.
The objectives of the task being executed by the robotic
platform are represented by the discrete random variable
T = ”Task objective.”, given thatT ∈{Task1,...,Task Φ}.
During an experimental trial the value of T = tis considered
constant in time k. Φ expresses the total number of tasks that
can be executed by the robotic platform.
Based on these considerations, the saliency of the
haptic stimulus perceived in the surroundings of v can be
formulated by the continuous random variable S(v,k) =
”Saliency of the perceived haptic stimulus in region v”.
This work deﬁnes S(v,k) for a class of tasks T=”Search
and follow of discontinuities between regions of surfaces
with Materiala and Materialb. ”, as presented in equation
6. S(v,k) is related by a soft evidence relation with the
perceived haptic stimulus map M(v,k) .

, S (v,k) ∈[0,1] (6)
The parameters sx = Gsobelx(d), sy = Gsobely (d)
and sz = Gsobelz (d) are determined using the volumet-
ric edge detector Gsobel following an approach analogous
to the operator proposed in [23]. Considering that the
exploratory element is located at v of the workspace, a
26 −th neighbourhood can be deﬁned around that lo-
cation. For a given neighbourhood v0,...,v 26, we can
deﬁne d = (Ω (v0,k),..., Ω(v26,k)) as the set of values
of Ω(vi,k). We consider that the haptic stimulus perceived
at each of the voxels (v0,...,v 26) of a neighbourhood
can be described by a probability distribution function
P(M(vi,k)|e(vi,k),c(vi,k),πper), respectively (details in sec-
tion IV). We can deﬁne, for each region vi, a constant
Ω(vi,k) that expresses the similarity of the perceived material
category of a region as Materiala or Materialb. The
constant Ω(vi,k) ∈[0,1] is determined by equation 7.
Ω(vi,k) =
1 −
(P(M(vi,k) = Mat.b|e(vi,k),c(vi,k),πper)−
P(M(vi,k) = Mat.a|e(vi,k),c(vi,k),πper)
)

B. Inference of the next exploration target
Based on the statistical independence relations between
the random variables Ok, I(v,k), U(v,k), S(v,k), T, presented
in ﬁgure 5 a), the probability joint distribution function
P(Ok,T,S (v,k),U(v,k),I(v,k)|πtar) for this model πtar, can
be decomposed as summarized in ﬁgure 5 b). Each of those
factors is described by a probability distribution function
presented in ﬁgure 5 b). The ﬁnal estimate for ˆok is given via
a Maximum a Posteriori(MAP) decision rule, as expressed
in equation 8 given a speciﬁc task T = t.

C. Determination of P(S(v,k)|Ok,T,π tar),
P(I(v,k)|Ok,πtar), P(U(v,k)|Ok,πtar)
As presented in ﬁgure 5 b), P(I(v,k)|Ok,πtar) is described
by a beta probability distribution function BI characterized
by the constants αI = 1 and βI = 2 .5. The proﬁle
of the probability distribution function P(I(v,k)|Ok,πtar)
is represented in ﬁgure 6 b). The selected proﬁle for
P(I(v,k)|Ok,πtar) attributes higher probabilities for lower
levels of I(v,k) and lower probabilities to higher values of
I(v,k) in order to promote the selection of regions of the
workspace with low values of inhibition level.
Following an analogous approach, P(U(v,k)|Ok,πtar) is
described by a beta probability distribution function BU
(ﬁgure 6 b)) with the constant parameters αU = 4 and
βU = 1 . P(U(v,k)|Ok,πtar) attributes higher probability
values to regions of the workspace perceived with higher
uncertainty U(v,k).
P(S(v,k)|Ok,T,π tar) is described by a beta probability
distribution function BS deﬁned by αS = 3 and βS = 1 (ﬁg-
ure 6 b)), assigning higher probability values to workspace
regions v with higher values of saliency S(v,k).

VI. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Evaluation of the haptic stimulus perception model
As referred previously, this work extracts the parameters
µE(M), σE(M), µC(M), σC(M) from the work [12].
However, the Bayesian program proposed in this work to
categorize the haptic stimulus Material1,...,Material n
follows a different approach than the work [12].
Following an approach analogous to several previous
works (Eg: [12], [18], [16], [24]) , the performance of
the Bayesian model proposed in section IV and the con-
sistency of the extracted parameters used to categorize the
haptic stimulus was evaluated by performing a numerical
simulation of 400 trials consisting in the local haptic ex-
ploration of samples of each of the reference materials
Material1,...,Material 10. In each trial, the local haptic
exploration of the reference materials was simulated by
generating random samples e
′
(v,k) and c
′
(v,k), obtained from
e(v,k) and c(v,k) corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise
(qC and qE), according the formulations c
′
(v,k) = c(v,k) +qC
and e
′
(vi,k) = e(v,k) + qE, respectively.
As presented previously, C(v,k) ∼ N(µC(M),σC(M))
and E(v,k) ∼N(µE(M),σE(M)) and in this experimental
setup the additive white Gaussian noise is described by
QC ∼ N(0,µC(M)
2 ) and QE ∼ N(0,µE(M)
2 ). For each
reference material Materiali, the classiﬁcation performance
was evaluate for a initial exploration of that region v (k =
0) and for progressive exploration of that region of the
workspace v during (k = 1 ,..., 4) exploration iterations.
The categorization ˆm(v,k)) of the perceived haptic stimulus
is determined by MAP - Maximum a Posteriorifollowing the
equation 9.
ˆm(v,k) = arg max
m(v,k))

The evaluation of the performance of the Bayesian model
πper proposed in section IV is presented in the confusion
table II using one exploration iterations ( k = 0 ) in that
location v and using ﬁve exploration iterations ( k= 4).
The results presented in table II show that globally the
Bayesian model πper has a good capability to discriminate
and categorize the perceived haptic stimulus with the correct
category of reference materials Materiali. The Bayesian
model πper shows a worst classiﬁcation performance for
haptic stimulus Material2, Material3 and Material10. By
integrating a higher number of sensory samples (k= 4), the
global performance of the Bayesian model πper increases,
including Material2, Material3 and Material10 materials.
The integration of ﬁve sensory samples (k = 4) allows the
system to improve the erroneous effect introduced by the
uncertainties of the measurements and by the additive white
Gaussian noise. As in other works by [12], [18], [16] and
[24], the different materials are correctly discriminated with
a high performance (average recognition rate higher than
90%).
In this work, we also have studied how the classiﬁcation
performance of the Bayesian model πper can be affected
by increasing levels of additive white noise QC and QE.
The increasing levels of additive white Gaussian noise were
simulated by increasing the standard deviation of the dis-
tributions of QC and QE, as presented in ﬁgure 7. By
increasing the magnitude of the standard deviation of the
distributions of QC and QE the classiﬁcation performance of
the Bayesian model πper decreases. This effect is attenuated
by the consecutive integration of several sensory samples
(k= 4). This demonstratates the relevancy of implementing
an active haptic exloration strategy in order to promote
the exploration of uncertainty regions of the workspace to
improve the current perceptual representation.

B. Autonomous exploration of the workspace
1) Visualization tools: The scientiﬁc concepts presented
and described in this work have been tested in a virtual
environment. The visualization tool selected to implement
the virtual environment was Gazebo 1.7. The robotic plat-
form used in this work is the ATLAS robotic platform [25],
which is provided by the DARPA robotics challengesoftware
package DRCsim-2.5. The high level control architecture of
the system, that was implemented using Robotic Operating
System-ROS Fuerte, is presented in ﬁgure 8 a). The deter-
mination of the inverse kinematics (IK), motion planing and
lower level control of the ATLAS robotic platform are not
discussed in this work.

2) Haptic stimulus scenarios: The virtual environment
built for this work consists in the robotic manipulation
platform ATLAS and a haptic stimulus presented in the top
of a planar table placed in front of the robotic platform.
The workspace region is partitioned in a volumetric grid as
suggested in ﬁgure 1. In this work, the workspace volumetric

I, Scenario II and Scenario III) of the haptic stimulus are
presented in ﬁgure 9 a)-c).
3) Autonomous exploration performance: This work as-
sumes that, at each time iteration step k, a exploratory
element of the robotic right hand touches a workspace region
v, sensory samples e(v,k) and c(v,k) are artiﬁcially synthe-
sised from the respective probability distribution functions
P(E(v,k)|m(v,k),πper) and P(C(v,k)|m(v,k),πper), given the
known ground truth material m(v,k) for that region of the
workspace. In each of the scenarios the index ﬁngertip of the
ATLAS robotic platform is initialized ( k= 0) at different lo-
cations. In Scenario I, v0 = (28,30,0), in Scenario II, v0 =
(28,31,0) and in Scenario I, v0 = (17,35,0). The probabil-
ity distribution function P(Ok|t,S(v,k),I(v,k),U(v,k),πtar)
is initialized as uniform probability distribution function.
The exploration paths used as benchmarks , B, for each of
the scenarios ( Scenario I, Scenario II and Scenario III) are
represented in the ﬁgure 9 d)-f) respectively, corresponding
to the edge regions between Material8 and Material10.
The different conﬁgurations of stimulus (unknown a priori
to the robotic system) have been explored during 10 different
trials, for each of the scenarios Scenario I, II and III. The
error for each exploration trial has been evaluated using
a performance metric , Γ, proposed in equation 1. For
each trial, the exploration procedures lasts l time iterations
(k = 0,..., (l−1)). In order to compare the performance
of the exploration in the different scenarios, a normalized
performance metric has been determined, Γ \l. This metric
represents the average divergence in cm per time iteration
of the exploratory element relatively to the ground truth.
Following an experimental approach analogous to [22], the
results of these experimental sessions are compiled and pre-
sented in table III. Table III shows that the proposed Bayesian
model πtar has a good precision and simultaneously a
considerable generalization capability. The exploration task
was performed with an average divergence ( Γ \l) from
the ground truth exploration paths smaller than 1cm. The
scenarios Scenario I and Scenario III have lower divergence
values due to the lower number of slope variation regions in
the discontinuity between the two regions.

By performing a empirical comparison between ﬁgure 9
g)-i) and ﬁgure 9 d)-f), we can verify that the experimental
exploration paths have a very good structural correspon-
dence with the benchmark exploration paths in all of the
3 scenarios. In Scenario III, the robotic system tracks the
complete structure (loop closure) of the discontinuity (closed
curve). As in the work [21], the system was able to deal with
severe changes in the slop of the discontinuity. In Scenario
II the robotic system was able to track a haptic discontinuity
with a progressive inversion in the slop of the discontinuity,
what clearly demonstrates the generalization capability of the
proposed approach. This emergent behaviour of this system
presents an improvement of the results presented in [21]. The
test of the system with other slop variations in discontinuities
than right angles (90◦) was suggested by [21] as future work.

ral evolution of P(I(v,k)|Ok,πtar), P(S(v,k)|Ok,T,π tar)

VII. C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This work has presented the theoretical foundations and
experimental implementation of the Bayesian models of the
touch attention mechanisms involved in the active haptic
exploration of heterogeneous surfaces by generic robotic
hands and sensory apparatus.
The global architecture of the proposed models have
shown a good generalization capability during the exe-
cution of a discontinuity following task between surface
regions made of distinct materials with three different spatial
conﬁgurations. The system was also able to perceive and
discriminate 10 different classes of materials. The system
have shown the capability to overcome the challenges placed
by the uncertainty associated to the unknown structure of the
environment and noisy sensory signals.
In the next developments of this work, a new Bayesian
model will be introduced in the action-perception loop
architecture of the system presented in ﬁgure 2. The new
model will be related with the recognition of the identity of
the explored structure (using the shape of discontinuities as
main cue) during the haptic exploration of the surface: active
haptic exploration and active recognition of objects.
