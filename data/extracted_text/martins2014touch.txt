A. Random variables of the model
Based on the sensory haptic inputs acquired at v, at
each time iteration step k, the model π implemented

in this Bayesian program determines the perceived cate-
gory of material of the voxel v of the workspace. This
work considers that the robotic system has the capability
to perceive and discriminate n = 10 classes of different
materials (haptic stimulus). The random variable M =
(v,k)
”Material category of v” can be defined as follows:
M ∈{Material ,...,Material } (2)
(v,k) 1 10
We will consider the same set of materials that was
used in the work [12]. These 10 reference materials cor-
respond to samples of acrylic, brick, copper, damp sponge,
feather, rough foam, plush toy, silicone, soft foam, wood,
respectively. These categories of materials are characterized
by different properties of texture, compliance and thermal
conductivity that were extracted using BioTac biomimetic
tactile sensor raw data (contact intensity, vibration, heat
flow). In this work we will only consider the texture and
compliance properties of the materials.
