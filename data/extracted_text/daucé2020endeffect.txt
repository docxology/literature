Abstract. Stemming on the idea that a key objective in reinforcement
learning is to invert a target distribution of eﬀects, end-eﬀect drives are
proposed as an eﬀective way to implement goal-directed motor learning,
in the absence of an explicit forward model. An end-eﬀect model relies on
a simple statistical recording of the eﬀect of the current policy, here used
as a substitute for the more resource-demanding forward models. When
combined with a reward structure, it forms the core of a lightweight
variational free energy minimization setup. The main diﬃculty lies in
the maintenance of this simpliﬁed eﬀect model together with the online
update of the policy. When the prior target distribution is uniform,
it provides a ways to learn an eﬃcient exploration policy, consistently
with the intrinsic curiosity principles. When combined with an extrinsic
reward, our approach is ﬁnally shown to provide a faster training than
traditional oﬀ-policy techniques.

1 Introduction
Recent developments in artiﬁcial intelligence have produced important qualitative
leaps in the ﬁeld of pattern recognition, in video games and assisted driving.
However, a number of tasks considered as simple, are struggling to ﬁnd a convincing
artiﬁcial implementation... This is the ﬁeld of action selection and motor control.
For instance, the ﬁne manipulation of objects, as well as movement in natural
environments, and their combination through real time motor control, remain
major scientiﬁc challenges at present. Compared to the case of video games,
reinforcement learning, for instance, remains rather limited in the ﬁeld of robotic
and motor control. The huge improvements “from-scratch” obtained in virtual
environments are diﬃcult to transfer to real robotics, where millions of plays can
not be engaged under risk of breakage, and simulators are expensive to develop.
The brain capability to develop motor skills in a very wide range of areas has
thus no equivalent in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial learning.
In short, learning a motor command, or a motor skill, happens to become
diﬃcult when considering a moderately complex set of eﬀectors, like a multi-joint

arm for instance, operating in the physical world. One aspect of the problem is
that the set of circuits that process the sensory signals and produce a motor
response is composed of digital units, the neurons, operating at fast pace, and
adapting rapidly, while, on the other side, the operation space is made of many
joints, rigid elements and muscles covering a wide, continuous domain of responses
with many degrees of freedom and much longer response times.
The reinforcement learning framework [16] provides a very generic setup to
address the question of learning, both from a machine learning and the brain
modelling perspectives. It contains many of the interesting constraints that an
agent is facing in order to learn a motor act. The theory, however, is constructed
around digital (discrete) control principles. The aim of a digital controller is to
establish a one to one correspondence between stimuli and actions, by matching
the input with a template action. Given a set of pre-deﬁned actions, an agent is
expected to pick the one that matches the most the input. In order to learn how
to act, the agent is guided by a reward signal, that is much cheaper to extract
than an exact set point. Then the choice of the action is monitored by a scalar
quantity, the utility, that is the long term sum of rewards [16]. A Reinforcement
Learning agent is agnostic about what the world is. It is just acting so as to
maximize the utility. Supported by the solid principles of dynamic programming,
this agent is expected to end-up in an optimal motor behavior with regards to
the reward constraints provided by the environment. A hidden diﬃculty however
lies in ﬁnding a good training dataset for the agent. A classical problem in that
case is the lack of sampling eﬃcacy due to the sparsity of the rewards, or to the
closed-loop structure of the control task, where the examples encountered are
statistically dependent on the controller parameters, providing a risk of a self
referential loop and local optimum.
The counterpart to digital control is analog control, corresponding to the
“classic” way to design a controller in the majority of real-world scenarios. In
the analog control case, both the controller and the environment are dynamical
systems. The control of a dynamic system generally relies on a model [14]. The
controller is capable to mimic the behavior of the environment, and know the
eﬀect of its actions on the environment. When a certain objective is given,
the controller can act so as to reach the objective through model inversion ,
though, in most cases of interest (like the control of an articulated body), the
models are not invertible and no single deﬁnite control can be established from a
given objective [7] without setting up additional and task-speciﬁc regularization
constraints. This kind of controller needs a forward model, that is generally given,
containing a large engineering knowledge about the agent’s eﬀector structure
and its environment. A problem arises when the learning of a motor command is
considered. Such controllers generally lack in adaptivity, and motor adaptation
is generally hard to train when the environmental conditions change.
There is thus an apparent trade-oﬀ between, on one side, maintaining a
model, that may include the many mechanical, environmental and sensory data
interactions, and, on the other side, being guided by a simplistic reward, concentrating
all the complexity of the external world constraints in a single scalar. The main
End-Eﬀect Exploration Drive for Eﬀective Motor Learning 3
diﬀerence between both approaches appears to be the presence (or the absence)
of a deﬁnite model of the external world. Knowing the eﬀect of our own actions
in the world provides ways to anticipate and do planning to reach an objective,
at the cost of maintaining and updating a model of the world [11]. At present
time, the trade-oﬀ between model-free and model-based control has provoked
many debates in the reinforcement learning community, with a preference toward
model-free approaches for they are cheaper to maintain and easier to control,
leaving unsolved the problem of the sampling eﬃcacy and causing very long
training sessions in moderately complex environments.
Our argument here is that the sampling eﬃcacy is bound to the problem of
training a model, and one can not expect to have an eﬃcient sampling without a
minimal model of the eﬀect of action. This model does not need to be perfectly
accurate, but it needs to be good enough to allow the agent to eﬃciently sample
its environment in order to grab all the disposable information in relation to the
task at hand. We assert here that a simple eﬀect model is enough to provide all
the needed variability in probing the eﬀect of an action or a policy.
2 Method
2.1 A probabilistic view to motor supervision
The probabilistic view to learning cause-eﬀect relationships is at the core of many
recent developments in machine learning, with a body of optimization techniques
known as “variational inference” implementing model training from data [10].
We assume for simplicity that the environment is not hidden to the agent, i.e.
the environment is fully observable. We also assume a discrete updating of states
and actions, like in classic reinforcement learning. Then, if s is the state of the
environment (or a context), and aan action performed by the agent, consider e
as the eﬀect of the action performed by the agent in that particular state.
The eﬀect may reﬂect, to some point, the result, or the outcome, of the action.
Modelling an eﬀect thus supposes that an action should come to an end, a ﬁnal
point, from which it is possible to evaluate or record a result. Consistently with
a bunch of neurological observations [5], a simple end-eﬀector open-loop control
is here assumed to take place, with a compositional motor command [8] driving
a multi-joint eﬀector toward a ﬁxed point, without feedback during the motor
realization.
The eﬀect can be a short-term eﬀect, like reading a new state from the
environment. It can also be a long term eﬀect, like winning or loosing a game, or
reaching an objective s∗ in the future. Because there is a lot of uncertainty on
the eﬀect of an action, it is modeled as a probability distributionp(E|s,a). When
the eﬀect is not dependent on a context, it can be noted more simply p(E|a).
Given a certain policy π(a|s), one can also consider the average distribution of
eﬀects obtained when applying that speciﬁc policy, namely
p(E|s) = Ea∼π(A|s)p(E|s,a) (1)
4 E. Dauc´ e
This marginal distribution is said the eﬀect distribution. By construction, it is
dependent on a particular policy (possibly stochastic) over states and actions,
and may, for instance, represent the invariant measure of an MDP under that
given policy. In our case however, we mostly consider the open-loop control
case. The policy is deﬁned over the elements of a compositional action, that is
choosing the components of an action. The end-eﬀect of such a compositional
action is the terminal state attained at the end of the action, without reading
the intermediate states.
In goal-directed control, if e is an expected eﬀect, an inverse control policy,
whose role is to maximize the chance to reach the eﬀect, can be deﬁned using
Bayes rule as:
π(a|s,e) = p(e|s,a)π(a|s)
p(e|s) (2)
That is the inversion of the model in a probabilistic setup [1]. Here the marginal
eﬀect distribution plays the role of a set point, that ﬁxates the distribution of
states toward which the action should head for.
Assume now p∗(e|s) be a target distribution of eﬀects. This distribution is
distinct from p(e|s) that is the distribution of eﬀects under the current policy.
It is assumed to be realizable from an (unknown) target policy π∗(a|s), that can
be decomposed into:
π∗(a|s) = Ee∼p(E|s,a)π∗(a|s,e) p∗(e|s)
p(e|s,a) (3)
The right side of the equation provides an estimation of the optimal policy
based on a sample eof the eﬀect of the action. Unfortunately, the optimal inverse
control policy π∗(a|s,e) is unknown. A shortcut is to approximate it with the
current inverse control policy π(a|s,e). In that case, it happens from equation
(2) that the formula simpliﬁes to :
π∗(a|s) ≃Ee∼p(E|s,a)π(a|s,e) p∗(e|s)
p(e|s,a) (4)
= π(a|s)Ee∼p(E|s,a)
p∗(e|s)
p(e|s) (5)
This formula shows that a correction term can be applied to the current policy
without owning an explicit forward model, but rather through reading the average
eﬀect of the policy. This forms the basis of a supervised approach to motor
learning, allowing to update a policy so as to reach a target marginal distribution.
For instance, in a dicrete setup, assuming there exists a Z(s) ∈R such that
log π(a|s) = βQ(s,a)+ Z(s) (softmax policy) makes it possible to update Q(s,a)
with the last eﬀect sample e like:
Q(s,a) ←Q(s,a) −α
β(log p(e|s) −log p∗(e|s)) (6)
End-Eﬀect Exploration Drive for Eﬀective Motor Learning 5
This update renders the current policy closer to the optimal one. A side eﬀect of
this update is that it also changes the eﬀect model that includes the contribution
of the policy (see eq. (1)). Repeating the operation with a small αand diﬀerent
samples of aand eshould, on average, reduce the divergence between π and π∗.
Equation (6) also provides an interesting identity when considering the classical
(reward-based) TD-error, with 1
β(log p(e|s) −log p∗(e|s)) taking the role of the
TD error, i.e. being identiﬁed with Q(s,a) −˜R(e) (with ˜R(e) a putative sum of
rewards up to e), making it possible, for instance, to set up an intrinsic reward
implementing a policy that realizes a known prior on the eﬀects. This intrinsic
reward is called here the “End-Eﬀect Drive”.
This supervised approach to policy relies on an eﬀect model p(e|s) that is
less detailed than a forward model. Various kinds of approximate forward models
can be found in goal-directed motor control literature, like dynamic goals [9] and
distal teacher [7], though generally learning to associate the current action with
a distal eﬀect [15,11]. In our case, the model knows nothing about the actions
that are performed by the agent. Only the end-eﬀects are recorded to build the
model. This “action-agnostic” forward model is close to the concept of state-visit
counter, as it is proposed in [2].
2.2 A uniform exploration drive
An important special case is when the objective is not to reach a certain eﬀect,
but rather to explore uniformly the range of all possible eﬀects. In that case,
the objective eﬀect distribution p∗is uniform over the eﬀect space. This kind of
supervision can be seen as a generalization of multiple-goal supervision [6] toward
deﬁning each possible eﬀect as a goal. The expected outcome of this uniform
drive is to provide a uniform sampling over the eﬀect space, i.e. implement a
uniform exploration policy. This intrinsic reward is called here the “End-Eﬀect
Exploration Drive” (E3D in short). It is consistent with the pseudo-count bonus
proposed in [2]. A similar drive was also proposed in a recent draft as the “state
marginal matching” drive [12].
By construction, the E3D is positive wheneis rarely visited under the current
policy ( p(e|s) < p∗(e)), and negative the other way. It thus tries to promote
rare and “surprising” eﬀects, and lower the occurrence of habitual “boring”
eﬀects. It must be noticed that the promotion of rare eﬀects tends to make
them less rare, and the rejection of habitual eﬀects tends to make them less
habitual, up to an equilibrium where the log-probability ratio should be close to
zero. Though the circular dependence between the policy update and the eﬀect
model update can provoke some convergence issues, and the equilibrium may
not be reached in the case of too fast ﬂuctuations of both distributions during
the training process. Some form of regularization is needed in most cases, and,
most importantly, should be counterbalanced with some form of utility drive, in
order to implement policy optimization through reward maximization. This is
the reason why a variational inference setup is particularly well suited in that
case, with the distal uniform drive taking the role of a prior under a variational
formulation.

2.3 Link with variational inference
A key intuition in Friston’s “uniﬁed brain theory” paper [4] is interpreting the
utility, as it is deﬁned in economy and reinforcement learning, as a measure of
the negative surprise (i.e the log probability over the sensory data distribution).
Combined with a prior distribution in the control space, the action takes the
role of a latent variable that is updated so as to reduce the prediction error with
regards to the prior, much like in predictive coding.
The uniﬁed approach proposed by Friston and colleagues is more generally
consistent with the variational auto-encoder principles, in which a latent description
of the data is constructed so as to implement a trade-oﬀ between the complexity
of the description and the accuracy of the prediction. Variational reinforcement
learning was recently proposed as a way to reconcile the discrete view to motor
control with the continuous processing of the latent variable in variational auto-
encoders [13,3,6], with the motor command playing the role of a latent code for
the reward data. In our simpliﬁed writing, the utility maximization (or surprise
minimization) rests on minimizing:
−Ea∼π(a|s);e∼p(e|s,a)βR(e) + KL(π(a|s)||π∗(a)) (7)
with R(e) here a measure of the sum of (extrinsic) rewards, up toe. Interestingly,
the current policy π(a|s) lies at the crossroad of a reference (maximum entropy)
policy π∗ and reward maximization, with the softmax policy representing a
compromise between both tendencies in the discrete case.
Extending toward a uniform prior over the space of eﬀects can be written
when both considering the motor command and the eﬀect as latent variables
that may both explain the current observation, that writes:
−Ea,e∼p(a,e|s))βR(e) + KL(p(a,e|s))||p∗(a,e)) (8)
For the purpose of illustration, we propose here an additional simpliﬁcation,
that is assuming anindependence of both factors (eand a) on causing the current
data (Na¨ ıve Bayes assumption), dividing the KL term in two parts:
−Ea∼π(a|s);e∼p(e|s,a)βR(e) + KL(π(a|s))||π∗(a)) + KL(p(e|s))||p∗(e)) (9)
This forms the baseline of our variational policy update setup. The optimization,
that is done onπ(a|s), obeys in that case on a triple constraint, that is maximizing
the reward through minimizing both the distance to a baseline policy and the
distance of the eﬀect to a reference (supposedly uniform) eﬀect distribution.
In a discrete setup, the uniform prior on the action is supposed implemented
with the softmax decision rule. It is then suﬃcient to assume the following update
for the action-value function. After reading e, the TD-error should be deﬁned
as:
TD(s,a,e ) = λ(Q(s,a) −R(e)) + 1
β(log p(e|s) −log p∗(e))) (10)
End-Eﬀect Exploration Drive for Eﬀective Motor Learning 7
With λ a precision hyperparameter accounting for the diﬀerent magnitudes
of rewards, allowing to manipulate the balance between reward seeking and
exploration-seeking drives. Interestingly, the reward R(e) has here the role of a
regularizer with regards to the current Q-value. The sum of the future rewards
can be estimated using the classical Bellman recurrence equation, i.e. Q(s,a) ∼
r(s,a) + Q(s′,a′), in which case the training procedure needs to maintain an
estimate of a standard action-value function Qref(s,a) to update the actual
parameters of the policy Q(s,a).
3 Results
We present in simulation a pilot implementation of the principle presented in
the previous section. The principal idea is to illustrate an important feature of
biological motor control, that is the control of an eﬀector showing many degrees
of freedom, like e.g. an articulated limb with many joints.
Let Aa control space accounting for a single degree fo freedom (here a discrete
set of actions i.e. A= {E,S,W,N }), each motor command owning n degrees
of freedom, i.e. a1:n = a1,...,a n ∈An. The eﬀect space is expected to be much
smaller, like it is the case in end-eﬀector control, where only the ﬁnal set point
of a movement in the peripheral space is considered as the result of the action.
Each degree of freedom is supposed to be independent, i.e. the choice of ai does
not depend on the choice of aj, so that π(a1:n|s0) = π(a1|s0) ×...×π(an|s0).
When a single context s0 is considered, the policy writes simply π(a1:n). The
size of the action space is thus combinatorially high, and one can not expect to
enumerate every possible action in reasonable computational time. In contrast,
the eﬀect space is bounded, and the number of all ﬁnal states can be enumerated.
However, the environment is constructed in such a way that some ﬁnal states
are very unlikely to be reached under a uniform sampling of the action space.
The environment we consider is a grid world with only 18 states and two
rooms, with a single transition allowing to pass from room A to room B (see
ﬁgure 1). Starting in the upper left corner of room A, the agent samples a
trajectory a1:7 ∈ Afrom a policy π, that trajectory being composed of 7
elementary displacements. The agent does not have the capability to read the
intermediate states it is passing through, it can only read the ﬁnal state after the
full trajectory is realized. In such an environment, a baseline uniform exploration
does not provide a uniform distribution of the ﬁnal states. In particular, when
acting at random, the chance to end-up in the ﬁrst room is signiﬁcantly higher
than the chance to end up in the second room.
The agent starts from scratch, and has to build a policy π(a) and an eﬀect
model p(sn), with sn the ﬁnal state. There are two task at hand. A ﬁrst task
is a simple exploration task and the objective is to uniformly sample the eﬀect
space, which should imply a non-uniform sampling policy. A second task consists
in reaching the lower-right corner, the state that shows the lowest probability
with a uniform sampling. For that, a reward of 1 is given when the agent reaches
the lower corner, and 0 otherwise.

Fig. 1: A simple two-rooms environment. Starting from the upper-left corner, the
agent is asked to plan a full sequence made of 7 elementary actionsa1,...,a 7, each
elementary action being in (E,S,W,N). The only read-out from the environment
is the ﬁnal state, and a reward, that is equal to 1 if the ﬁnal state is the lower-
right corner, and 0 otherwise.
The update procedure is made of a single loop (see algorithm 1). The update
is done online at each trial. Both the policy and the eﬀect model are updated,
with diﬀerent training parameters. The general idea is to train the eﬀect model
a little more “slowly” than the policy, for the policy improvement to ﬁrmly take
place before they are passed on the eﬀect model.
Stemming from a uniform policy, the eﬀect of the E3D drive is to render the
”rare” states more attractive, for they are bound with a positive intrinsic reward,
while the more commonly visited states are bound with a negative reward, that
reﬂects a form of ”boredom”. Marking a rare state as “attractive” tends to
increase the number of visits, and ﬁnally lower the initial positive reward. In the
case of a “gradient” in the likelihood of the ﬁnal states, with a number of ﬁnal
visits inversely proportional to the distance to the initial state, the E3D drive
favors a progressive “expansion” of the visiting territory, for each peripheral
state attained will increase the probability to reach its further neighbors, up to
the ﬁnal limit of the state space. In small environment like the one proposed
here, the limit is rapidly attained and a rapid alternation of visits is observed
over the full state space.
The ﬁnal distribution of states is compared in ﬁgure 2 in the case of a uniform
policy and the E3D drive. In that speciﬁc setup, a strong bias in favor of the ﬁrst
room is observed, and a gradient of likelihood is observed from the initial state
toward the lower right corner (ﬁgure 2A). In contrast, a time consistent uniform
pattern of visit is observed in the second case, that illustrates the capability of
the E3D drive to set up speciﬁc polices devoted to the wide exploration of the
environment.
When a reward ris provided by the environment, the question comes whether
to balance the policy update procedure in favor of seeking for rewards or seeking
for novel eﬀects. By construction, the exploration drive is insensitive to the
value of β, for the update is exactly proportional to 1
β. A high β is associate
with a small update and vice versa. this is not the case for the leftmost part
of the update (equation 10). A high β render the agent more sensitive to the
extrinsic rewards. In practice, while no reward (or a uniform reward) is provided

by the environment, the agent is only guided by the exploration drive. Once
a reward is encountered, it tends to overtake the initial uniform exploration,
providing a ﬁrm tendency toward a reward-eﬀective selection of action. This is
in contrast with the standard epsilon-greedy strategy, imposing to balance the
exploration/exploitation trade-oﬀ by hand.
The E3D approach ﬁnally provides an Online/on-Policy training procedure
that conforms to the main requirements of eﬃcient reinforcement learning, showing
both an eﬃcient exploration policy when the rewards are sparse, and the capability
to monitor the exploration/exploitation tradeoﬀ with the inverse temperature β
in function of the magnitude of the rewards.
The cumulative rewards obtained with the E3D update and a state-of-the
art oﬀ-policy/epsilon greedy update are compared in ﬁgure 3, with ε set to 0.1.
If both techniques manage to reach a reward-eﬃcient policy in the long run, the
exploration strategy developed in E3D makes it easier to reach the rewarding

state, providing the reward earlier in time and developing a fast-paced reward-
seeking strategy that overtakes the baseline approaches.
4 Conclusions
Despite its simplicity, our pilot training setup allows to illustrate the main
features expected from the inversion of a target distribution of eﬀects, that is the
capability to rapidly explore the environment through a reciprocal update of the
policy and the eﬀect model. We found in practice that the update of the model
needs to be a bit slower than that of the policy to allow for the policy to improve
over time and increase the extent of the eﬀect space in a step by step manner.
By balancing the eﬀect of the rewards with the inverse temperature parameter,
it is possible to catch and exploit very sparse rewards in large environments.
The model is developed here as a ﬁrst draft in an “end-eﬀect” setup, with very
little inﬂuence of the context or the states visited in the monitoring of the policy.
Extensions toward closed-loop state-action policies is not far from reach, for
equation (10) allows to exploit the Bellman recurrence to guide the exploration-
driven policy with a reference action-value function, that should be updated
in parallel to the model and the current policy. Extensions toward continuous
action spaces are also needed in order to address eﬀective motor control learning,
which resorts to a deeper interpretation of our approach toward the variational
inference setup.
