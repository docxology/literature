Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loa ded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform
for simulating SU( N) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantu m states beyond SU(2). A
prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling.
Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensiona l lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the
determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate t he attractive three-color Hubbard model on a π-
ﬂux square lattice at half ﬁlling. We show that color-depend ent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge
density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-colo r π-ﬂux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced
charge ﬂuctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stro nger Néel ordering on the π-ﬂux square lattice. The
coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting tem perature, at which they vanish simultaneously . The
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent
Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Hubbard model oﬀers a prototype Hamiltonian to
describe quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated
fermionic systems. It simply incorporates the nearest-nei ghbor
hopping and the on-site interaction capturing the essence o f
the system that leads to a competition between itinerancy an d
localization, but remains a challenging problem due to the
non-perturbative nature of strong correlation physics. Th e
standard SU(2) Hubbard model is commonly used to de-
scribe interacting electrons in solids, and interestingly the four-
component Hubbard model arises in two-orbital transition-
metal oxides [
1, 2] and twisted bilayer systems where the layer
pseudospin and the real spin are combined together [ 3, 4].
Over the past two decades, fast-evolving ultracold atom
technologies have enabled the experimental realization of the
multicomponent Hubbard models using large-spin fermions i n
optical lattices [ 5–15]. Beyond investigations in crystalline
solids, large-spin ultracold fermions trapped in optical l at-
tices provide a highly tunable platform for implementing mu l-
ticomponent Hubbard models, enabling explorations of ex-
otic many-body physics that is rare in solids. So far ultra-
cold atom experiments have realized Mott insulator and an-
tiferromagnetic correlations in the SU(2 N) Hubbard mod-
els ( N=2, 3) [
12–14], and color-selective Mott physics in
the three-color Hubbard model with tunable inter-color cou -
plings [ 15]. Theoretical studies of the multicomponent Hub-
bard models have been boosted by the development of numeri-
cal methods and ever-increasing computing power. The quan-
tum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, has emerged as a power-
ful computational tool for simulating various multicompon ent
Hubbard models. Speciﬁcally, it has been successfully appl ied
to investigate: (1) repulsive SU( N) Hubbard models ( N=3, 4,
6) [
16–21] and (2) attractive three-color Hubbard models with
both SU(3)-symmetric interaction [ 22–24] and tunable inter-
color couplings [ 25]. These theoretical studies focus on two-
dimensional geometries, particularly square and honeycom b

lattice structures that are experimentally realizable in u ltracold
atom quantum simulators. In d = ∞ dimensions, dynami-
cal mean-ﬁeld theory (DMFT) has been employed to simulate
the attractive three-color Hubbard model with SU(3) symme-
try that can be broken via tuning inter-color couplings [
26–28].
In the repulsive SU( N) Hubbard model, large N enhances
quantum ﬂuctuations, leading to the appearance of new phase s
that are not stable or present in the SU(2) case [ 29, 30]. But
in the attractive SU( N) Hubbard model, large N suppresses
charge ﬂuctuations, making the system classical-like. Nev er-
theless, unlike the repulsive SU( N) model and the attractive
SU(2) model, multiple spin states in the attractive Hubbard
model favor the formation of various fermionic bound states
(e.g. trions and doublons) [
22–28, 31, 32]. The attractive
SU(3) Hubbard model, as a minimal SU( N) model beyond
SU(2), hosts both simple bound states and strong charge ﬂuc-
tuations, and therefore oﬀers an opportunity to study uncon -
ventional strong correlation physics in which various type s of
composite particles get involved [
22, 23, 25].
In experiment, the SU(3) 6Li Fermi gas with tunable at-
tractive interaction has been realized in a trap [ 33, 34]. Until
very recently, the half-ﬁlled three-color Hubbard model (w ith
color-dependent Hubbard interactions) was realized with u l-
tracold 6Li atoms in a two-dimensional square optical lattice,
where the notorious three-body loss that once rendered such
system unstable has been dramatically suppressed [
35]. It has
also been proposed that microwave-shielded ultracold dipo lar
molecules can be used to simulate the attractive SU(3) Hub-
bard model, since the double microwave shielding technique
can suppress loss processes [
36–38]. Meanwhile, there has
been a growing theoretical interest in the ground-state pro p-
erties of the attractive three-color Hubbard model. In earl ier
studies, the variational [ 39, 40], self-energy functional [ 41, 42]
and DMFT [ 26–28] methods unanimously suggest that, in
d = ∞ dimensions a quantum phase transition between a color
superﬂuid phase and a trionic phase can occur in the attracti ve
three-color Hubbard models with both SU(3)-symmetric inte r-
action and tunable inter-color couplings, independent of s pe-
ciﬁc ﬁlling. This phase transition is of particular interes t, since
it is reminiscent of the transition between the quark superﬂ uid
and the baryonic phase in high-energy physics [ 43–45].
Recently, the sign-problem-free QMC simulations of the

half-ﬁlled attractive three-color Hubbard model show a ver y
diﬀerent scenario in two dimensions [ 22, 23, 25]. When the
Hubbard interaction is SU(3)-symmetric, the CDW quantum
critical point on the honeycomb lattice cannot be described
within the Gross-Neveu- Y ukawa framework for SU(3) Dirac
fermions [
22], which may be the consequence of forming dou-
blons and trions. Moreover, QMC simulations reveal that the
attractive three-color Hubbard model with anisotropic int er-
color couplings hosts coexisting CDW and Néel phases on the
honeycomb lattice, where the Néel order is weak and orig-
inates from the emergence of magnetic oﬀ-site trions [
25].
While the coexistence of charge and spin orders occurs in a
variety of two-dimensional materials [
46–49], the interplay of
on-site and oﬀ-site trions in the attractive three-color Hu bbard
model oﬀers a diﬀerent mechanism for realizing the coexisti ng
CDW and Néel orders [ 25].
So far the study on the two-dimensional attractive three-
color Hubbard model is very limited in the literature due to
lack of accurate computational methods. In this work, we em-
ploy the DQMC method to simulate the attractive three-color
Hubbard model on a π-ﬂux square lattice at half ﬁlling. The
π-ﬂux square lattice features a Dirac-like band structure si m-
ilar to that of the honeycomb lattice, despite exhibiting an in-
creased coordination number from z = 3 to z = 4 . W e inves-
tigate the inﬂuence of charge ﬂuctuations on the Néel order-
ing and demonstrate thermal melting of the coexisting CDW
and Néel orders that is of broad interest in condensed matter
physics. W e also suggest a GL analysis, which implies that th e
coexistence of CDW and Néel orders is stabilized by color-
dependent Hubbard interactions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec.
II,
we introduce the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a
π-ﬂux lattice and detail DQMC parameters. In Sec.
III, we
establish that increasing coordination number enhances Né el
ordering through increased oﬀ-site trion density. In Sec. IV,
bond-bond correlations show that oﬀ-site trions are not lon g-
range correlated and therefore randomly oriented. In Sec. V,
we demonstrate simultaneous vanishing of CDW and Néel or-
ders at ﬁnite temperatures. In Sec.
VI, the GL theory reveals
that anisotropic interactions stabilize coexisting order s. Con-
clusions and discussions are presented in Sec. VII.

on-site inter-color attraction. The chemical potential va nishes
at half ﬁlling. W e introduce the color-dependent Hubbard in -
teractions, setting U12 = U and U13 = U23 = U′.
On the π-ﬂux square lattice, the gauge ( tˆex = t, tˆey =
(−1)xt) is chosen for the nearest-neighbor hopping integral
tij, such that the product of phases of hopping integrals around
a plaquette equals eiπ = −1, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The
dispersion relation of the π-ﬂux square lattice is given by
ǫ(k) = ±2t
√
cos2 kx + cos2 ky, and the band structure is il-
lustrated in Fig. 1(b). At half ﬁlling, the Fermi surface touches
four Dirac points. This gives rise to a Dirac-like band struc ture
similar to that of the honeycomb lattice at half ﬁlling, exce pt
that the coordination number increases from three to four. T his
makes the π-ﬂux square lattice an ideal platform for investigat-
ing how the coordination number alone inﬂuences the coexis-
tence of the CDW order developed mainly by on-site trions
(schematically shown in Fig.
1(c)) and the Néel order devel-
oped by oﬀ-site trions (a local bound state with a one-fermio n
end on one site and a two-fermion end on the nearest-neighbor
site, schematically shown in Fig.
1(d)) [ 25].
At half ﬁlling, the DQMC simulation of the attractive three-
color Hubbard model deﬁned by Eq. ( 1) is sign-problem-free
when the Hubbard-Stratonovich decomposition is employed
in the color-ﬂip channel [
22, 23, 25, 50]. Our simulations
are performed on the π-ﬂux square lattices with sizes L =
6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Unless speciﬁcally stated, the temperature
T and Hubbard Uαβ are given in the unit of hopping integral
t. In our simulations, we set |U| = 6 throughout this work.
The temperature is set to T = 0 .1 in Secs. III and IV, while

ﬁnite-temperature properties in Sec. V are investigated across
various T .
III. OFF-SITE TRION FORMATION AND NÉEL
ORDERING
The QMC simulations of attractive three-color fermions on
the honeycomb lattice have demonstrated that charge ﬂuctua -
tions have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the density of oﬀ-site tr i-
ons [ 22, 23, 25]. In this section, we will increase coordination
number from 3 (honeycomb lattice) to 4 ( π-ﬂux square lattice),
and investigate the corresponding inﬂuence on the Néel orde r
developed by the oﬀ-site trions.
Oﬀ-site trions are transformed from on-site trions as a con-
sequence of charge ﬂuctuations and their density scales as
t2/|U|2 [
25]. T o characterize the on-site trion structure, we
deﬁne the on-site triple occupancy
P3 = 1

⟨ni1ni2ni3⟩, (2)
where N = L2 is the number of lattice sites. The structure of
oﬀ-site trions can be described by the oﬀ-site triple occupa n-

P3oﬀ;1 −|U′|, and P3oﬀ;3 −|U′| data for the honeycomb lattice

The Néel order parameter mQ is plotted as a function of |U′| on the
π-ﬂux square lattice (red squares) and honeycomb lattice (ex tracted

dicating enhanced Néel order with increased oﬀ-site trion d ensity .
from Ref. [ 25], and plot them as dashed curves in Fig. 2. Cru-
cially, at a ﬁxed |U′|, P3 on the π−ﬂux square lattice is signiﬁ-
cantly lower than that on the hoenycomb lattice, while P3oﬀ on
the π−ﬂux square lattice is signiﬁcantly higher than that on the
honeycomb lattice. This demonstrates that increasing the c o-
ordination number by 1 enhances charge ﬂuctuations, promot -
ing oﬀ-site trion formation from on-site trions. Another ke y
observation from Fig. 2 is that the diﬀerence between P3oﬀ;1
and P3oﬀ;3 at a ﬁxed |U′| on the π-ﬂux square lattice is larger
than that on the honeycomb lattice, which manifests that bot h
ends of the oﬀ-site trion carry larger net magnetic moments
with increasing coordination number.
W e then investigate the impact of coordination number on
the strength of Néel order. According to Refs. [
25, 51, 52], the
Néel order parameter is deﬁned as
mQ = 1
N
√ ∑
ij
(−1)ix+iy +jx+jy ⟨mimj ⟩. (4)
Here (ix, iy) is the coordinate of site i; mi =
4
1
4 (ni1 + ni2 − 2ni3), which deﬁnes the magnetic mo-
ment at site i. mi vanishes when site i contains three colors
(123), while it is non-zero when site i accommodates either
net colors (12) or net color 3. W e perform ﬁnite-size extrapo -
lations of the Néel order parameter mQ at |U′| = 3 , 4, 5, 5.5,
as presented in Fig. 3(a). The Néel order develops when
|U′| is below 5.5. Based on the ﬁnite-size extrapolations, we
obtain the thermodynamic-limit values of mQ and plot the
mQ − | U′| relation on the π−ﬂux square lattice in Fig. 3(b).
As a comparison, we also extract the mQ − | U′| data on
the honeycomb lattice from Ref. [ 25] and plot this dataset
in Fig. 3(b). The inset of Fig. 3(b) reveals a nearly linear
relationship between mQ and P3oﬀ;3 , demonstrating that
enhanced Néel ordering results from the increased oﬀ-site
trion density. For a given |U′|(> 6), increasing coordination
number from 3 (honeycomb lattice) to 4 ( π-ﬂux square lattice)
induces much stronger Néel order. Fig.
3(b) also illustrates the
vanishing of the Néel order (mQ) as |U′| → 6, accompanied
by the restoration of SU(3) symmetry in the three-color
Hubbard model.
IV . SP ATIAL CORRELATIONS OF OFF-SITE TRIONS
Color-dependent Hubbard interactions can induce coexist-
ing on-site trions and Néel-like oﬀ-site trions on a half-ﬁl led
lattice [
25]. On the honeycomb lattice, oﬀ-site trions have
no speciﬁc spatial orientation. However, it is unclear whet her
the π-ﬂux gauge ﬁeld would enable oﬀ-site trions to acquire a
preferential spatial orientation, since the Néel order deﬁ ned by
Eq. ( 4) cannot distinguish between two scenarios: (1) oﬀ-site
trions orient randomly along all four lattice directions; ( 2) oﬀ-
site trions exhibit preferential alignment along the x-direction
compared to the y-direction, owing to the uniform hopping in-
tegral t along the x-direction, in contrast to the alternating t
and −t along the y-direction. Nevertheless, the diﬀerence be-
tween these two scenarios can be distinguished by measuring
bond-bond correlations. W e deﬁne the nearest-neighbor ki-
netic bond operator di,ˆea for one oﬀ-site trion as
di,ˆea =
3∑
α=1
ti,i+ˆea (c†
i,αci+ˆea,α + H.c.), (5)
where ˆea denotes the two possible nearest-neighbor bond di-
rections, taking the vector forms ˆex = (1 , 0) or ˆey = (0 , 1). It
should be noticed that on-site trions make small contributi ons
to di,ˆea since they must be dissociated in order to contribute.
The correlation between the bond along the ˆea direction and
the bond along the ˆeb direction is deﬁned as
Bab(i, j) = ⟨di,ˆea dj,ˆeb ⟩ − ⟨di,ˆea ⟩⟨dj,ˆeb ⟩. (6)
In Fig.
4 we plot the bond-bond correlations Bab(i, j) as func-
tions of rij for various |U′| with L = 14 . The rapid decay of
Bab(i, j) to zero demonstrates that oﬀ-site trions lack long-
range spatial correlations in any direction. The absence of nu-
merical diﬀerences between Bxx(i, j) and Byy (i, j) shown in
Fig. 4 conﬁrms that oﬀ-site trions exhibit no speciﬁc spatial

oﬀ-site trions distribute randomly along all four directio ns. In
addition to this primary feature, Fig. 4 reveals that at a ﬁxed
small rij , Bab(i, j) increases with larger interaction anisotropy
(smaller |U′|) , which reﬂects the enhanced density of oﬀ-site
trions in stronger anisotropic regimes. The negative value s of
Bxy(i, j) and Byx(i, j) originate from the gauge choice where
tˆex = t and tˆey = ( −1)xt. The calculations in this section
demonstrate that the Néel order is spatial modulation of oﬀ-
site trions without any preferential orientation.
V . CDW AND NÉEL ORDERS AT FINITE

This section investigates the thermal melting of coexistin g
CDW and Néel orders through calculating order parameters
and correlation functions. The charge order is characteriz ed
by the CDW order parameter D, which captures charge density
modulation, and the staggered order parameter Mα, quantify-
ing spatial modulation of each fermionic color α. Following
Ref. [

atures T , as presented in Fig. 5. Through ﬁnite-size extrapo-
lations, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit values of D, M1,
M3, and mQ and plot these order parameters as functions of
temperature T in Fig. 6. The thermal evolution curves demon-
strate the simultaneous vanishing of CDW and Néel orders at
the critical temperature Tc = 0 .417, which is within the reach
of current cold-atom experiment with attainable low temper -
ature T ∼ 0.25 [
53]. This simultaneous vanishing originates
from the microscopic mechanism that Néel order is induced
by charge ﬂuctuations of CDW background. Below Tc, the re-
duced numerical diﬀerence between M1 and M3 with increas-
ing T reﬂects a decline in oﬀ-site trion density. The magnitude
of D remains consistently intermediate between M1 and M3
since it averages over all colors.
T o study the thermal evolution and the interplay between

on-site and oﬀ-site trions, we perform simulations on the te m-
perature dependence of on-site triple occupancy P3 (deﬁned
in Eq. ( 2)). The P3-T curve is plotted in Fig. 7(a), in which P3
exhibits non-monotonic behavior, achieving a maximum at th e
peak temperature T ∗ slightly above the critical temperature Tc.
For T > T ∗, P3 decreases monotonically with increasing tem-
perature, ultimately converging to the high-temperature l imit
of 0.125.
Below the critical temperature Tc, the triple occupancy P3
increases monotonically with T since the oﬀ-site trion density
decreases. Remarkably, P3 remains constrained below the the-
oretical maximum value 0.5 due to charge ﬂuctuations: withi n
the trionic CDW phase, fermions undergo hoppings from on-
site trions to adjacent lattice sites, a process that transf orms
local triple occupancies into oﬀ-site trion conﬁgurations . Be-
tween Tc and T ∗, P3 continues to increase, due to the melting
process from the trionic CDW phase to the trion liquid phase.
During this phase transition, on-site trions become random ly
distributed throughout the lattice, reducing available ho pping
channels. The hopping channel reduction suppresses the for -
mation of oﬀ-site trions, thereby preserving more on-site t rion
conﬁgurations. With further temperature increase ( T > T ∗),
on-site trions dissociate into unbound fermions [
23], resulting
6
in a decrease of P3 toward the high-temperature limit of 0.125.
T o further investigate the trion formation during thermal
melting, we calculate the correlation function
Tij = ⟨ni1ni2nj3⟩, (8)
which quantiﬁes spatial correlations between the color-3
fermion at site j and the color-(1,2) fermions at site i. Since the
thermal melting of CDW/Néel orders accompanies the restora -
tion of the discrete translational symmetry along the y dire c-
tion (the change of spatial periodicity 2a → a, with a be-
ing the lattice constant), the trion distribution along the y di-
rection should exhibit a corresponding periodicity modula -
tion. Speciﬁcally, site i is set as the origin (0, 0), and site
j is chosen along the y direction. Tij is then designated as
T0,2m and T0,2m+1 respectively for site j = (0 , 2m) and
site j = (0 , 2m + 1) . As plotted in Fig.
7(b), the correla-
tion function Tij exhibits distinct spatial correlation behaviors
distinguishing the ordered trionic density modulation and the
disordered phase. At low temperature ( T = 0 .4 < T c), in
the coexisting CDW and Néel ordered phase, the inequality
T0,2m > T 0,2m+1 at large rij signiﬁes ordered spatial mod-
ulation of on-site trions, directly manifesting the CDW bac k-
ground. As temperature increases beyond Tc to T = 0 .526, the
equivalence T0,2m = T0,2m+1 = 0 .225 conﬁrms random dis-
tribution of on-site trions, signaling the emergence of a tr ion
liquid phase. The deviation from the theoretical asymptoti c
value 0.25 demonstrates dominant yet non-exclusive on-sit e
trion conﬁgurations that coexist with oﬀ-site trions and do u-
blons, originating from persistent quantum ﬂuctuations. C ol-
lectively, the temperature evolution of on-site triple occ upancy
P3 and correlation function Tij provides microscopic signa-
tures of transformation in trionic conﬁgurations across ph ase
transitions.
VI. GINZBURG-LANDAU THEORY
Numerical and microscopic analysis in Sec.
V reveals si-
multaneous vanishing of coexisting orders since the Néel or der
arises from charge ﬂuctuations of the CDW order. In this sec-
tion, we employ a GL framework [
54–59] and identify param-
eters that stabilize the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders,
providing a macroscopic and energetic view of the system.
Without loss of generality, we take U12 = U and U13 =
U23 = U′, with the dimensionless parameter s = |U′|/3|U|
characterizing the interaction anisotropy. By deﬁning ope ra-
tors ˆmi = ni1 + ni2 − 2ni3 and ˆdi = ni1 + ni2 + ni3, the
Hamiltonian deﬁned by Eq. (
1) is reformulated as

where ˜tij = tij /|U| and γ is a tunable dimensionless param-
eter. The conditions γ − s + 1
3 < 0 and γ + s + 2
3 < 0 are
imposed to ensure attractive interactions.
The partition function is expressed in a path inte-
gral as Z =
∫
D[¯c, c]e−S[¯c,c] with action S[¯c, c] =∫
dτ (¯c(∂τ + h)c + HU (¯c, c)), where h describes non-
interacting fermions on the π-ﬂux square lattice. The
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation introduces auxil-
iary ﬁelds mi and di to decouple interactions, giving
Z =
∫
D[¯c, c, m, d ]e−S[¯c,c,m,d]. The transformed action then
reads

Coeﬃcients a and b originate from the mean-ﬁeld decompo-
sition of the term ˆmi ˆdi and can be determined via saddle-
point equations. At this point, we can integrate out the
fermionic ﬁelds, yielding the eﬀective partition function Z =∫
D[m, d]e−SE [m,d] with SE [m, d] denoting the eﬀective ac-
tion. The exponential weight is then given by

Substituting Eqs. (

nian ( 12) and taking the logarithm of Eq. ( 11), we write the
eﬀective action in the Matsubara frequencies as

mk′−k = 1
2 m(cos kx + cos ky)δk′,k+Q, (18)
dk′−k = 1
2 d(cos kx + cos ky)δk′,k+Q. (19)
The GL free energy expansion is derived through introduc-
ing the non-interacting Green’s function G0(k) = ( iωn −
ǫk)−1 and the mean-ﬁeld operator Vk,k′ = −(
√
3mk′−kλ8 +
3dk′−kλ0). By expanding the eﬀective action to fourth order,
we obtain
f = F − F0 = am
2 m2 + um
4 m4 + ad
2 d2 + ud
4 d4 + ζ
2 m2d2,
(20)
where the GL coeﬃcients are given by
am = 1
γ − s + 1/3 + 3Π(Q),
ad = 1
γ + s + 2/3 + 9Π(Q),
um = 81Γ( Q, Q),
ud = 6561Γ( Q, Q),
ζ = 729Γ( Q, Q),
(21)
with Π(Q) = Tr[ ∆k+QG0(k + Q)∆kG0(k)], Γ(Q, Q) =
Tr[(∆k+Q)2G2
0(k + Q)(∆k)2G2
0(k)], and ∆k = cos kx +
cos ky.
T o determine the constraints on GL coeﬃcients required for
order coexistence ( m ̸= 0 , d ̸= 0 ), we solve the saddle-point
equations ∂f/∂m = 0 and ∂f/∂d = 0 , and get the coupled

γ = −7/6 (corresponding to |U| = 6, |U′| = 3). Rescaled coeﬃ-
cients ˜ad, ˜am and unmodiﬁed coeﬃcients ud, um are shown. Sign
changes in um and ud signal simultaneous vanishing of coexisting
CDW and Néel orders, consistent with DQMC results. The cutoﬀ of
Matsubara frequency ωn with |n| ≤ 20 and lattice size L = 80 are
used.

straint

or
2γ + 4s + 5/3 = 0 . (26)
with s = |U′|/3|U| ∈ (0, 1/3]. T o obtain physical solutions
for the conditions of order coexistence, the equations Eq. ( 23)-
(26) must be satisﬁed. Under these constraints, Eq. ( 22) takes
the form

The existence of solutions to Eq. ( 27) necessitates −am > 0,
−ad > 0, um > 0, and ud > 0.
W e now plot the temperature dependence of GL coeﬃcients
(deﬁned in Eq. ( 21)) in Fig. 8 at s = 1 /6, γ = −7/6 (cor-
responding to DQMC parameters |U| = 6 , |U′| = 3 and
satisfying the constraint given by Eq. ( 26)). For visual com-
parison, GL coeﬃcients ad and am are rescaled using ˜aα =
aα
1.5 max(|ad|) , α ∈ { d, m}, while ud and um retain their un-
modiﬁed values. This rescaling preserves the sign of GL coef -
ﬁcients but modiﬁes their magnitudes for visualization cla rity.
From Fig. 8, we conclude that the conditions of order coexis-
tence ( −am > 0, −ad > 0, um > 0, ud > 0) are satisﬁed
throughout the low-temperature regime. The sign changes of
coeﬃcients um and ud with increasing temperature represent
8
simultaneous vanishing of coexisting CDW and Néel orders,
consistent with DQMC results shown in Fig.
6. Crucially, our
GL analysis reveals that the stable coexistence requires th at
the Néel ordering is originated from the CDW background and
the SU(3) symmetry is broken. The qualitative agreement be-
tween the GL analysis and DQMC simulations conﬁrms the
dominant role of trionic states and a special mechanism in th e
coexisting CDW and Néel orders.
VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In summary, we have performed the sign-problem-free
DQMC simulations to investigate the trion ordering in the ha lf-
ﬁlled attractive three-color Hubbard model on a π-ﬂux square
lattice. The color-dependent Hubbard attractions induce c o-
existing CDW and Néel orderings that survive up to the same
melting temperature. As expected, Néel order on the π-ﬂux
square lattice is much stronger than that on the honeycomb la t-
tice, since more hopping channels enhance charge ﬂuctuatio ns
and then give rise to more oﬀ-site trions. Even in the pres-
ence of a π ﬂux, oﬀ-site trions are not long-range correlated,
which means the oﬀ-site trion has no preferential spatial or ien-
tation. Within the framework of phenomenological GL theory ,
we demonstrate that color-dependent Hubbard interactions are
the condition for inducing coexisting CDW and Néel orders.
Coexistence of charge and magnetic orders have long been a
major research focus in condensed matter physics. In the con -
text of ultracold fermions, our work suggests a diﬀerent mec h-
anism for coexisting CDW and Néel orders, where the Néel
order arises from the ﬂuctuations of the CDW order and mani-
fests as spatial modulation of oﬀ-site trions without any pr efer-
ential orientation. In addition, our QMC results are asympt otic
accurate, which provide a benchmark for future studies of th e
attractive three-color Hubbard model.
Finally we propose a scenario for observing the coexisting
CDW and Néel orders through ﬂuorescence imaging in cold
atom experiment. In this approach, the charge and spin/colo r
distributions can be simultaneously probed in optical latt ices
by performing separate imaging of each spin state [
35, 61, 62].
Speciﬁcally in the three-color system, the in-plane atomic mo-
tion is frozen by a rapid increase of the lattice depth (achie ved
by increasing laser intensity), and then the color- 1 state is re-
moved via Stern-Gerlach separation [ 35]. Subsequently, the
lattice depth is further increased, and meanwhile a vertica l
magnetic ﬁeld gradient is applied to spatially split color- 2 state
and color- 3 state into two sheets for simultaneous ﬂuorescence
imaging [ 35, 61, 62]. If the CDW order and the Néel order co-
exist, ﬂuorescence images should simultaneously display ( i) a
similar staggered pattern on both sheets (i.e., bright spot s tend
to appear on site i with an even value of ix + iy), characteriz-
ing the CDW order; and (ii) stronger staggered modulation of
color-2 state (i.e. M2 > M 3), characterizing the Néel order.
