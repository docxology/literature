Introduction
[0.1] The Active Inference Framework (AIF) is a recent computational theory of
cognition [7, 25, 46], as well as a modeling framework for computational agents
[49,10,9].Atitscore,itgivesacounterintuitivebutpowerfulpictureofhowour
minds work. According to the AIF, neuronal activity organizes so as to predict
upcomingsensorysignal,henceproducingacoherent,dynamicperceptionofthe
world organized around the prior beliefs of the agent. Critically, proponents of
the AIF argue that this predictive process also encompasses motor signal, un-
derlyinge(cid:30)cientand(cid:29)exiblemotorcontrol[24,1,25].Atitscore,theAIFrelies
on one core mathematical result, the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The FEP
2 Avel GuØnin(cid:21)Carlut
was initially formulated as a precursor of the AIF, i.e. a computational theory
of the brain which holds that neural activity maximizes the Bayesian coherence
at hierarchically nested scales [27, 26, 19]. It quickly evolved into the more am-
bitious attempt to formally ground this claim in the mathematical context of
Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) [20, 21, 22], and integrate it to the broader
contextofmathematicalphysics[48,23].Successiveworksapproachedtheques-
tion through di(cid:27)erent mathematical perspectives, and clari(cid:28)ed the distinction
between di(cid:27)erent subcases depending on the dynamical structures of the agent-
environment system. But the core idea behind the FEP can be summarized in
few words. In substance, any system which remains stasistically separated from
his environment develops and enacts an implicit cognitive model of its environ-
ment, embedded in the dynamics of the interaction.
[0.2] However, the adequacy of the FEP to represent the processes underly-
ing cognition has been called into question since its inception. Some lines of
criticism leveraged against the FEP were defused by a careful discussion of
the implications of the framework (e.g the Dark Room Problem [28], or the
anti-representationalist argument [47]), or were made obsolete by later formal
developments (e.g. the limitation of early formulations to strongly mixing sys-
tems [8]). To our knowledge, the main open line of criticism of the FEP (e.g.
[11, 34, 35, 6]) tend to accentuate two core arguments. First, the FEP fails to
reproduce adequately the asymmetry between agent and environment ; second,
the FEP fails to reproduce the open-ended evolution of biological and cognitive
statespaces. The present discussion provides further context to this line of argu-
mentation by showing the deep relation between those two arguments. Here, we
attempttoaddressthequestionoftheadequacyoftheFEPfromameaningfully
di(cid:27)erent(althoughcomplementary)angle.Wewillfocusmorespeci(cid:28)callyonthe
agency of cognitive beings in de(cid:28)ning how they perceive and engage with the
world, formalized in terms of contextuality. In particular, we hope that this axis
will build on existing literature by showing how the two problems relate, and
therefore facilitate further research intended to close the gap between the FEP
and the ambitions behind its development.
[0.3] Contextuality is a concept inherited from quantum mechanics, where it
describesthe propertyofstates (e.g. positionor momentumof aparticle)which
are not well-de(cid:28)ned prior to their observation. Following [33], we propose to
apply this concept to the construction of cognitive meaning by agents. Indeed,
contextuality applies in general to properties that are observer-dependant. This
applies to cognitive semiotics, regardless of whether the dynamics of cognition
or the world an agent engages with are distinctly quantum-like. For exemple,
where I see a book (cid:28)lled with carefully chosen and arranged symbol to convey
a speci(cid:28)c communicative intent, my cat may see a dangerous creature to be op-
posed by any means necessary. Hence, book-ness is contextual, or at the very
least the cognitive meaning imprinted onto a given book is. We will see how
this intuitive sense of contextuality maps onto its more formal meaning as non-
commutativity between acts of observation (or, in the speci(cid:28)c context we set
for this discussion, cognitive engagement). Furthermore, we will argue that an
Contextuality, Cognitive engagement, and Active Inference 3
adequate model of cognitive engagement requires an explicit, non-reducible ac-
count of contextuality. Indeed, cognitive contextuality constitutes at its core an
expression of agent-driven interaction, as it corresponds to a process where spe-
ci(cid:28)c states become de(cid:28)ned precisely because they are meaningful to the agent.
But at the same time, it provides formal grounding to the open-ended evolution
of cognitive meaning, as states which are brought about through cognitive con-
textuality become actual, causally e(cid:30)cient states of the world in the context of
the interaction.
1 Contextuality in quantum physics
[1.1] Contextuality, in the sense we call onto here, is a concept associated to
thedevelopmentofearlyquantummechanics.Thedevelopmentofquantumme-
chanics was motivated in part by the strange fact that given the spectrum of
electromagnetic emission by a black body, light energy seemed to travel by dis-
crete packets of E = hν (where h is Planck’s constant, and ν is the frequency
considered).Bythe30s,physicistscouldaccountforthatphenomenonthrougha
fullycoherentreformulationofphysicsintermsofwavefunctions andoftheoper-
ators acting on them. This, however, entailed a major shift for the fundamental
object treated by physics. Indeed, the evolution of quantum systems would not
follow dynamics de(cid:28)ned over an objective state of the system. Instead, it would
evolve along a complex scalar (cid:28)eld whose squared amplitude at a given point
corresponds to the probability of (cid:28)nding the system at this very point if it was
observed,andonlycollapsetospeci(cid:28)cstateswhenobserved.Einstein,Podolsky,
and Rosen famously contested the coherence of the new theory by pointing out
that collapse would violate locality (i.e. the fact that information can’t travel
faster than light), and quantum theory would need to be reduced to another
theory where systems have objective states and dynamics that can’t commu-
nicate faster than light [12]. The conjunction of those two conditions came to
be known as local realism. However, the later development of Bell’s theorem [3]
showedthattheempiricalfactsobservedbyquantumtheoryweren’tcompatible
with local realism. Later, both Bell and a team formed by Kochen and Specker
independantlyderivedthatrealismitselfwasincompatiblewiththeformalismof
quantum mechanics [4, 43]. While the strategies for both demonstrations di(cid:27)er,
we can explain this fact through simple observation about the basic objects of
quantum mechanics.
[1.2] In quantum theory, interaction is described through the application
of operators acting over the Lebesgue space de(cid:28)ned by the wavefunction. This
construct generalizes the results of linear algebra for in(cid:28)nite-dimension spaces,
like the space de(cid:28)ned by each point where a wavefunction is de(cid:28)ned, assuming
that the wavefunction is normalizable (i.e. the integral of its square amplitude
converges). Physical variables applying to a system are generally de(cid:28)ned as lin-
ear application on the Lebesgue space of its wavefunction. To be precise, some
operators over the wavefunction can be de(cid:28)ned by their action on a complete
orthonormal basis for the Lebesgue space ; and have an eigenbasis where the
4 Avel GuØnin(cid:21)Carlut
action of the operator on each component (called eigenvectors) reduces to mul-
tiplication by a scalar (called eigenvalue). Those operators can be associated
to observables, i.e. physically meaningful, measurable variables like energy or
position. The application of such operators to the system is understood to rep-
resent the measurement of its state along their speci(cid:28)c eigenbasis. The output
of the process is an eigenvalue of the corresponding operator, with probability
proportional to the squared amplitude of the wavefunction projected onto the
correspondingeigenvector(orintegratedoverthesubspacecorrespondingtothe
eigenvalue). Additionally, the wavefunction is then projected onto the eigenvec-
tor or the subspace corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Critically, two
operators can only commute if they share the same eigenbasis. This means that
in the general case, the (cid:28)nal state of the system as well as the outcome of ob-
servation depend on the order in which a given series of measurement is applied
[44].Inconsequence,thereisn’tanintrinsicstateofthesystemwhichisrevealed
by measurement ; rather, measurement participates in the construction of the
state of the system.
Commutativity & Quantum contextuality
Let us consider a simple qubit S characterized by the orthogonal eigen-
vectors (|+⟩;|−⟩). Its wavefunction is then de(cid:28)ned by a|+⟩+b|−⟩, where
|a|2+|b|2 =1.
One could want to measure whether the system is in state |+⟩. They
could use for that purpose the projector associated to the |+⟩ state, P =
+
|+⟩⟨+|. Using the bra-ket notation, ⟨+| is to be understood as the dual of
|+⟩.Itisthelinearapplicationthatsends|·⟩toitsscalarproductwith|+⟩,
i.e. ⟨+| : x → ⟨+|x⟩. Using the identities ⟨+|+⟩ = ⟨−|−⟩ = 1 and ⟨+|−⟩ =
⟨−|+⟩ = 0 ; it is straightforward that P |+⟩ = |+⟩ and P |−⟩ = 0, so
+ +
P has for eigenstates (|+⟩;|−⟩) and for eigenvalues (1;0). Therefore, the

corresponding measurement could output 1 and update the system in the

The associated projector is P = (|+⟩+|−⟩)(⟨+|+⟨−|) . Again, it is straightfor-

and for cor-

As P and P do not share an eigenbasis, they should not commute.

In other words, their application in di(cid:27)erent order should give di(cid:27)erent
results. Using the eigenmatrix representation of P and P in the eigen-

Therefore, the state of the qubit S depends on the order in which the suc-
cessive measurements are applied.
A fortiori,wecannotdescribetheoutcomeoftheexperimentasan"ob-
jectivelyreal"statewhichpreexiststheprocessofobservation,andissimply
revealed through measurement. The state of the qubit is brought about by
the act of observation, and more speci(cid:28)cally by the context set by the as-
sociated operator. This property is what we call quantum contextuality.
[1.3] Nearly all experts agree today that contextuality constitutes a funda-
mental property of quantum phenomena, as is entailed by mainstream quan-
tum formalism. A thornier debate lies in whether contextuality derives from the
structure of quantum statespaces, or quantum statespaces themselves derives
from contextual properties. As of 2013, roughly identical proportion of active
researchersinthefoundationofquantummechanicsprefereitherinterpretation,
with a slightly higher proportion prefer a mix of the two [50]. At one extreme
ofthedistributionistheCopenhageninterpretation,whichcanbecharacterized
as direct realism about the mathematical model described above. At the other
is quantum Bayesianism (qBism), which holds on the contrary that quantum
wavefunction are only a manifestation of the Bayes-optimal information that
the broader world holds about the states of a given system given past interac-
tions [36]. qBism is best supported by a series of mathematical results which
show that most of quantum formalism can be reconstructed only from the con-
straint of Bayesian coherence [31, 32]. Arguably, it is empirically supported by
the realization of Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment [40], which demonstrates
that the act of measuring either particle-like or wave-like property of a photon
can determine whether the photon travelled as a particle or a wave prior to the
measurement.Thisentailseitherretro-causality(adirectviolationoftheuniver-
sally accepted principle of causality), or the more likely interpretation that the
particle or wave nature of the photon is not well de(cid:28)ned prior to its observation
- as was initially proposed in [53]. To be clear, qBism emphatically does not
deny the existence of physical reality. Rather, it holds that contextuality is a
fundamental trait of physical reality, a thesis they characterize as Participatory
Realism [30].
2 Contextuality in cognitive science
[2.1] Several authors have drawn an explicit link between the ontic regime of
Participatory Realism, as formalized in the context of qBism, and the nature of
perception and cognition [29, 33]. The argument can be summarized as follows.
The constraints of online perception-action regulation do not a(cid:27)ord a full top-
down representation of all possible states in the world followed by an explicit
inference of external states & plani(cid:28)cation of motor command. First, the infor-
mation that an agent gathers through their senses is extremely insu(cid:30)cient for
this purpose ; second, the computational and memory cost of this calculation is
6 Avel GuØnin(cid:21)Carlut
much beyond what any biological system can do. What agents can do instead is
to "ask questions" to the world through a selective opening to sensory stimuli
which underlies the semiotics of their engagement with the world [33]. The be-
havioral regulation underlying those questions can be very rigid, down-to-earth,
and simple, like chemotaxis ; it can be very complex, abstract and contingent,
like(cid:28)nancialaudit.Butbyde(cid:28)nition,theyalwaysentailtherulesofengagement
that the agent applies in speci(cid:28)c situations and toward speci(cid:28)c kinds of objects
; and implicitly or explicitly, it underwrites what kinds of things exist from the
perspective of the agent. The common thread is that, by the very existence of
regulation mechanisms, agents project meaning onto the world by de(cid:28)ning what
type of stimuli is relevant and what for. As noted by [17], this property places
contextuality at the very core of cognition. What an agent sees in the world -
moreprecisely,whattheworldis to the agent insemioticterms-becomedepen-
dent on the speci(cid:28)c context of observation. Here, the "context of observation"
is to be understood as the implicit meaning embedded in the speci(cid:28)c dynamics
underlying perception-and-action, and hence the semiotics of the world to the
agent.
[2.2]Thequestionweseektoaddressinthissectionisasfollows:iscognition
indeed contextual in the strict sense deployed in quantum theory, and under
which condition ? To rea(cid:30)rm the de(cid:28)nition we are working with, we call con-
textuality or observer-dependency the property of a system whose "intrinsic",
causally e(cid:30)cient internal states are a function of the way they are observed.
For the reason exposed in box [Quantum contextuality], a qubit is a contex-
tual object ; because it can be accessed without modi(cid:28)cation, a bit is not. One
4
may intuit that because cognition is not a quantum system , and the world it
engages with is not a quantum system, their interaction cannot display contex-
tuality. This would be overlooking the fact that, unlike in the prototypal case
of classical information theory, the agent and the world do not typically have
a prior agreement on the data format they communicate with. In other words,
the terms of interaction are not typically de(cid:28)ned a priori, as the agent actively
produces and projects meaning. For example, what one learns by engaging with
a book depends critically on whether they are literate. One would not end up
in the same state whether they learn to read and then engages with a book or
engages with the same book and then only learns to read. Hence, the acts of
[learning to read] and [engaging with a book] do not commute, and a system
which may engage in either activity displays contextuality at the adequate scale
of description. The same argument applies trivially wherever a given act pro-
duces irreversible changes in dynamics of the agent’s cognitive activity, i.e. sets
the context for further engagement in the world. Critically, it also appplies at
evolutionary scale (e.g. emergence of a(cid:27)ordances [41]) or behavioural scale (e.g.
priming or framing e(cid:27)ects, perceptive decision [5, 39]).
[2.3]Thisargumentcanbeformalizedfurtherusingtheformalismof[16](see
also [15, 14, 13]). Assuming an interaction between an agent A and an environ-

ment E, the symmetry of the interaction is broken when the agent A develops a
memory of the history of interaction. This memory can be mediated by concept
learning, enabling the agent to understand the world through types which all
come with their speci(cid:28)c rules for engagement. More generally, it stands for any

between"meaningful"states(thosethatareobserved)and"meaningless"states

(those that are "burnt" as free energy) . Due to the intrinsic irreversibility of

an auxiliary byproduct of cognitive engagement with the world. In the general

3 Active Inference and contextuality
[3.1] At face value, the framework of ActiveInference appears to be an excellent
(cid:28)ttodescribethecontextualityofhumancondition.UnderActiveInference,the
dynamics of cognitive agents (cid:29)ow so as to approximate optimal Bayesian infer-
ence(seebox[Bayesianinference])aboutthestatesoftheworld,giventhesystem
of prior beliefs they have about the world. Its core speci(cid:28)city, as compared to
earlier models of cognition such as good old fashioned Reinforcement Learning,
is the postulation of a fundamental unity between perception and action. Under
Active Inference, an agent anticipates at the same time their sensory and motor
states, and the prediction they generate for motor states plays the role of motor
command [24, 1, 25]. The core constraints of Bayesian coherence then applies
to both their active and sensory states, so that the agent attempts to update
adaptivelypriorbeliefstheycanchangewhileconservingpriorbeliefstheycan’t.
Underthismodelingframework,coreconstraintsoverthecontinuedexistenceof
cognitive agents are understood as particularly robust or precise beliefs about
their self-identity. We can say that under Active Inference, an agent enacts a
model of themselves [47], a process usually described as "self-evidencing" [38].
This argument, which may appear like a simple modeling trick, fundamentally
reframes the problem of cognitive engagement with the world. Indeed, classical
cognitive architectures would need to explicitly represent the world and com-
pute a priori motor commands to engage with the world - an extremely costly
process. On the contrary, an Active Inference agent can fully leverage the power
of the context set by its exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive states
to adequately anticipate their upcoming actions, and then implement adaptive
sensorimotor regulation at an extremely reduced cost [37].
Bayesian inference
BayesoptimalitycorrespondstotheapplicationtoBayes’ruleforstatistical
inference,whichstatesp(A|B)=p(B|A)×p(A)/p(B).Inthisnotation,Bis
commonly held to be an observation, and A to be a possible cause for that
observation. Then, we can infer the posterior probability of A (the proba-
bility that A is the case after we have observed B) - given the knowledge of
the likelihood of observing B when A is the case, and the prior probability
of A (the probability of A before we have observed B).
Let us assume that A is the presence of a cat and B the occurrence of
meowing.Givenaprobabilityp(A)=0.4ofencounteringacat,aprobability
p(B|A) = 0.5 that the cat meows, and a probability p(B|¬A) = 0.1 that I
hear meowing despite no cat being there, I can infer that p(B) = p(A)×
Contextuality, Cognitive engagement, and Active Inference 9
p(B|A)+p(¬A)×p(B|¬A) = 0.4×0.5+0.6×0.1 = 0.26 and p(A|B) =
p(B|A)×p(A)/p(B)=0.5×0.4/0.26=10/13.
Calculatingthemarginalprobabilityp(B|A)quicklybecomesintractable
as the statespace becomes large, as the cost of computing the dynamics of
the world grows exponentially with dimensionality. Hence, we often use
variationalmethodologiestocomputeapproximationstotheBayes-optimal
posterior probablity. The most useful one is often de(cid:28)ned as the minimum
of variational free energy F(q) = −E [ln(q(b)) + ln(p(a,b))], which pro-

[3.2] This natural (cid:28)t between Active Inference and cognitive contextuality
comes when we consider the mathematical grounding o(cid:27)ered by its proponents,
theFreeEnergyPrincipe (FEP)[20,21,22].Initssimplestform,theFEPcanbe
explained as follows. Be a stochastic dynamical system that veri(cid:28)es a partition
betweenthreesubspaces(A,B,E)suchthatthestatesofAandB arecondition-
allyindependantgiventhoseofB,i.e.p(a|b,e)=p(a|b)andp(e|b,a)=p(e|b)for
all(a,b,e)in(A,B,E)(aswellassomeothertechnicalconditionsnotaddressed
here).Intuitively,thisconveystheideathatallinformationabouttheinteraction
betweenanagentAanditsenvironmentE ismediatedbystatisticale(cid:27)ectonthe
so-called Markov Blanket B. Then, there exist an information geometry which
relates every state of A to a distribution over states of E q (e), and the (cid:29)ow
a
of the most likely states of A act so as to minimize the variational free energy
of this distribution given states of B [45]. This means that, given the de(cid:28)ning
assumptionsoftheFEP,theagentactssoastooptimizetheBayesiancoherence
of belief-like distributions entailed by the information geometry. Extensive work
has been undertaken to generalize the result to dynamical trajectories rather
than single states, and to clarify the distinction between agents verifying di(cid:27)er-
ent coupling conditions [21, 23]. In particular, it was demonstrated that when
the boundary B includes "active states" which are not directly in(cid:29)uenced by
states of E and do not directly in(cid:29)uence states of A, the belief-like distribu-
tion for which the agent’s internal (cid:29)ow maximizes Bayesian coherence includes
those active states. In other words, the FEP successfully explains the a priori
counter-intuitive behaviour of cognitive agents under Active Inference based on
very simple physical assumption, reducing in essence to the individuation of the
agent from its environment.
[3.3] Yet, this extremely powerful result su(cid:27)ers from its material grounding.
Indeed,theFEPisbyde(cid:28)nitionconstructedinthecontextofDynamicalSystems
Theory. This is precisely the reason for its strength, as DST formalizes with
maximal generality the idea of an object with a well-de(cid:28)ned state embedded
in a well-de(cid:28)ned space, and which evolves along well-de(cid:28)ned rules. Formally
speaking, a dynamical system is typically de(cid:28)ned by a function Φ : (TX) → X
such that Φ(0;x)=x and Φ(t2;Φ(t1;x))=Φ(t1+t2;x) ; where X is the "phase
space" where the system evolves and T is a time-like space. Yet, because of the
same rule that enforces the coherence of the (cid:29)ow, a dynamical system cannot
be contextual: for any two evolution operators Φ : Φ(t ;) and Φ : Φ(t ;), it is

isitselfcommutative).InthecontextoftheFEP,thistranslatesintoanecessary
attraction of the system toward a predi(cid:28)ned attracting distribution p(A,B,E).
As the information geometry, which de(cid:28)nes the agent’s belief-like distribution
q (e), is itself entailed by the attracting distribution, it cannot change with
a
the evolution of the system. Hence, the cognitive meaning (and the modes of
engagement which it corresponds to in the context of our discussion) described
by the FEP is therefore well-de(cid:28)ned and determined a priori, rather than a
contextual product of the act of observation. Only the situation of the agent
within that cognitive meaning may evolve in time. Hence, the contextuality of
cognition is not accounted for by the FEP, neither in its intuitive nor formal
aspects.
4 Conclusion
[4.1]Inthisarticle,wehavearguedthattheFreeEnergyPrinciplefailstorepro-
duce a fundamental element of cognition, contextuality. Our argument proceeds
in three times. First, we have explained the conceptual background and the for-
malism underlying the notion of contextuality in its original context, quantum
mechanics.Weemphasizethat,whilecontextualityisafundamentalhallmarkof
quantum system, it does not require quantumness per se. Rather, it constitutes
theexpressionofobserver-dependancyinthede(cid:28)nitionofthetargetsystem,and
thereforethelackofaprede(cid:28)nedstatepriortoobservation.Second,wehavear-
gued that contextuality indeed constitutes a fundamental aspect of cognition.
In our development, we argued it is constitutively equivalent to the projection
of meaning onto the world by a cognitive agent. Therefore, contextuality would
be a fundamental condition of the construction of a perceptive (cid:28)eld an agent
canengagewith,andhenceofcognitionitself.Third,wehavediscussedhowthe
FEP fails to account for cognitive contextuality due to its dynamical systems-
theoretic settings. By construction, DST supposes the coherent de(cid:28)nition of the
state in which a system is at any point in time, and is therefore incoherent with
the contextuality of those states. This line of argumentation provides further
context to prior discussion over the adequacy of the FEP as a formal theory of
life and cognition. Indeed, cognitive contextuality constitutes at its core an ex-
pressionofagent-driveninteraction,asitcorrespondstoaprocesswherespeci(cid:28)c
states become de(cid:28)ned precisely because they are meaningful to the agent. But
at the same time, it provides formal grounding to the open-ended evolution of
cognitive meaning, as states which are brought about through cognitive contex-
tuality become actual, causally e(cid:30)cient states of the world in the context of the
interaction.
[4.2] To be clear, we do not deny that the Free Energy Principle or Active
Inference constitute useful developments in mathematical physics and cognitive
sciencerespectively.Ourviewisratherthattherichpictureofcognitiveengage-
ment drawn by Active Inference is not well grounded in the mathematics of the
FEP, requiring further mathematical developments. By our present account of

activity. This occurs notably through the enaction of causal constraints existing
over its attention, which bring the agent to "bundle" collections of sensory and
active states into perceptive concepts. While in some instance (e.g. nematode
cognition) we may perhaps discard the unfolding nature of concept creation as

given set-theoretic space, they do not a(cid:27)ord the emergence of novel possibilities
through system evolution. In the context of the FEP, this translates into the
de(cid:28)nition of the external states the agent can perceive as a (cid:28)xed and prede-
(cid:28)ned collection of external states (GuØnin(cid:21)Carlut 2023), without possibility for
change or a fortiori for feedback on the agent’s intrinsic dynamics. To the best
of our knowledge, no mathematical framework currently describes the way from
"bare" cognitive dynamics to the contextual de(cid:28)nition of perceptive states and
back. With the present discussion, we hope to have made a coherent case that
thisconstitutesanimportantgoal,andthatthestudyofcognitivecontextuality
is a productive ground to do so.
[4.3]Threelinesofformalresearchseemofparticularinterestinthatperspec-
tive. All have in common that they diverge signi(cid:28)cantly from the mathematical
background of set theory, which is structurally reliant on the pre-de(cid:28)nition of
the space in which a system is de(cid:28)ned [42]. First, some preliminary work points
to the re-de(cid:28)nition of the Free Energy Principle in the context of topos theory
[2], a competing foundational theory of mathematics which embeds local topol-
ogy in the very de(cid:28)nition of individual states. This provides some grip on the
notion of "where" a statement is veri(cid:28)ed, and therefore on cognitive contextu-
ality. However, we should note that topos theory was speci(cid:28)cally constructed
to verify the structure of a closed Cartesian category, which means in a lay-
man’s terms that its mathematical structure allows the non-perturbative access
to information. Second, some authors have attempted to directly describe Ac-
tive Inference in terms of category theory [51, 52], a mathematical discipline
describing the structural relations within mathematical theories. In this con-
text, Active Inference acquires the more general structure of a closed monoidal
category,whichaccountsforperturbativeaccesstoinformationandthereforefor
a stronger sense of contextuality. Third, and perhaps most importantly, a small
communityofresearchershavetriedtoformalizeincategory-theoretictermsthe
basicargumentofqBism(aspersection1,thequantumtheorywhichcenterson
the property of contextuality per se as the basic block of quantum theory), and
have re-formalized the FEP within that context [15, 14, 13]. While mathemat-
ically abstract, these attempts at reframing the FEP matter pragmatically due
12 Avel GuØnin(cid:21)Carlut
to their potential capacity to account for the ontic regime we’ve called Partici-
patory Realism, and therefore describe the agent-driven and open-ended nature
of cognitive meaning.
