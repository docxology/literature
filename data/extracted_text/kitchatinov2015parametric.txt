Long-term variations of solar activity, including the Grand minima, are
believed to result from temporal variations of dynamo parameters. The simplest
approximation of dynamo waves is applied to show that cyclic variations
of the parameters can lead to an exponential growth or decay of magnetic
oscillations depending on the variations frequency. There is no parametric
resonance in a dynamo, however: the selective sensitivity to distinct frequencies,
characteristicofresonantphenomena,isabsent.Aqualitativeexplanationforthis
finding is suggested. Nonlinear analysis of dynamo-waves reveals the hysteresis
phenomenon found earlier in more advanced models. However, the simplified
model allows a computation of a sufficiently large number of dynamo-cycles
for constructing the distribution function of their amplitudes to reproduce
qualitatively two modes of solar activity inferred recently from cosmogenic
isotope content in natural archives.

INTRODUCTION
Hydrodynamicflowsgeneratingcosmicmagneticfieldsusuallyvarywithtime.Parame-
tersofthegenerationprocesses -hydromagneticdynamos-are,therefore,time-dependent.
Variations of dynamo-parameters can be either periodic, as in the case of modulation by
density waves in galactic dynamos, or irregular, as in stellar convection zones. The case
of irregular variations currently attracts much attention in relation to the Grand minima
of solar activity (cf., e.g., the review of Charbonneau 2010), events similar to the famous
Maunder minimum when there were almost no sunspots for about 70 years (Hoyt &
Schatten 1996).
The number of large-scale convective cells generating magnetic fields in the Sun is
not large (Gilman & Miller 1985) so the longitude-averaged dynamo parameters fluctuate
considerably (Olemskoy et al. 2013). Fluctuations of dynamo-parameters are believed to
beresponsible fortheobserved variationsofsolarcycle durationsandamplitudesandeven
for the events of Grand minima. Dynamo models with fluctuating parameters generally
reproduce these observed phenomena (cf., e.g., Moss et al. 2008; Usoskin et al. 2009;
Choudhuri & Karak 2012; Karak & Choudhuri 2013; Olemskoy & Kitchatinov 2013).
Relations between the fluctuation properties and the resulting variations in magnetic
cycles remain, however, unknown. In particular, the important theoretical question on
the possibility of parametric resonance in dynamos† remains unanswered. It is not clear
whether there are special frequencies in the fluctuations spectrum to which the field
generation processes are especially sensitive. In some dynamo models, the characteristic
fluctuationtimewasput equalto ahalfofthemagneticcycle period,which corresponds to
the parametric resonance condition for harmonic oscillator, but an enhanced reaction on
fluctuations of such a duration was not found. The reason probably is that contemporary
dynamo modelsarenumerical anditisdifficult tofindfunctionalrelationsfromtheresults
of numerical computations.
Probably forthesame reason,thepublications onresonant phenomena indynamos are
not many. The dynamo equations do not possess sources of magnetic fields. The resonance
problem, therefore, does not have an analogue of driving force, and only parametric
†The non-periodic character of the parametric fluctuations is significant but not of principal
importance. Stochastic parametric resonance (Klyatskin 1980) should be considered for this case.

resonance can be considered. Schmitt & Ru¨diger (1992) and Moss (1996) studied the
parametricresonance forgalacticdynamos. Gilman&Dikpati (2011)andMoss& Sokoloff
(2013)considered theresonance phenomena forstellar convective dynamos.Aninteresting
version of parametric resonance in nonlinear dynamos was found by Reshetnyak (2010):
the resonance can result from a time-delay in the reaction of dynamo-parameters to the
generated magnetic field.
This paper suggests using a simplified dynamo model to treat the resonance problem
analytically. Analytical solutions may be helpful in understanding the results of more
complicated numerical models. Such an approach proved to be productive in studies
of magneto-rotational instability where a simplified analytical model revealed similarity
rules confirmed subsequently by numerical computations (Kitchatinov & Ru¨diger 2004).
Sufficient simplification for an analytical treatment of the resonance problem give an
(local) approximation of dynamo-waves. In this approximation, the dynamo-wave length
is assumed short compared to the scale of variations of dynamo parameters. Such a scale
ratiodoesnotholdfortheSunandforcorresponding numerical modelsofglobaldynamos.
However, it is difficult to find a numerical model whose results were not interpretable in
terms of the Yoshimura (1975) law for dynamo-waves propagation.
Weshallseethattheparametricmodulationofdynamowavescanleadtoanexponential
growth or decay of thewave amplitude depending onthe frequency γ of variationof the α-
parameter of magneticfield generation.This modulation,however, isnot a resonance. The
enhanced selective reactionto specialfrequencies, characteristic ofresonant phenomena, is
not present in dynamos. A qualitative explanation for this circumstance will be suggested.
Another problem where the dynamo-wave approximation can be useful is related to
the two distinct modes of solar activity inferred recently by Usoskin et al. (2014) from
radiocarbon data. The two modes may be related to the hysteresis in nonlinear dynamos:
allowance for the dependence of turbulent diffusivity on the magnetic field reveals the
coexistence of two stable dynamo solutions with different amplitudes of magnetic cycles
thatarerealiseddependingonthepre-historyofdynamoparametervariations(Kitchatinov
& Olemskoy 2010). Dynamo-hysteresis was also found in 3D numerical simulations of
Karaketal.(2015).However,amoderatenumberofmagneticcyclescoveredbycomputations
with complicated models hinders their statistical analysis. We shall see that allowance for
3
nonlinearities in the dynamo-wave approximation also shows the hysteresis phenomenon.
Millions of magnetic cycles can be computed with this approximation. The distribution
function of the amplitudes of these cycles has two maxima similar to the dual distribution
found by Usoskin et al. (2014) from historical data on solar activity.
BASIC EQUATIONS
We start from the mean-field dynamo equation
∂B
= rot(αB +V B ηrotB) (1)
∂t × −
(cf., e.g., Zeldovich et al., 1983). The velocity V corresponds to the shear flow of, e.g.,
non-uniform rotation. Cartesian coordinates are used with the y-axis aligned with the
velocity vector V and the x-axis along the velocity gradient,
V = (0,Sx,0). (2)
Coefficients in the equation (1) and the shear value S are assumed position-independent,
i.e. the scale of magnetic field variation is assumed small compared to the characteristic
scale of the fluid inhomogeneity (short dynamo-waves). For the convection zone of a star,
the y-axis of our coordinate system corresponds to the azimuthal direction, the x-axis
points in the direction of the angular velocity gradient and the yz-plane is the isorotation
surface. The magnetic field,
∂A
B = ,B,0 , (3)
−∂z !
includes toroidal (B) and poloidal ( ∂A/∂z) components.
−
The field B and the poloidal field potential A depend only on the coordinate z and
time. The equation system for the two field components reads
∂B ∂A ∂2B
= S +η ,
∂t − ∂z ∂z2
∂A ∂2A
= αB +η , (4)
∂t ∂z2
where the contribution of the α-effect into the toroidal field generation is omitted (the
αΩ-dynamo).
We consider wave-type solutions of A,B exp(ikz) and normalize the equations (4)

to dimensionless units. Time is measured in units of (k2η )−1. The η is the characteristic

is the dynamo-number. The parameters αˆ and ηˆ may depend on time explicitly, as they
do in the linear problem on parametric resonance, or implicitly via their dependence on
the magnetic field amplitude in a nonlinear problem.
ABSENCE OF PARAMETRIC RESONANCE
If the parameters of Eqs.(5) do not depend on time (ηˆ= αˆ = 1),the threshold value of
the dynamo-number for emergence of non-decaying oscillations = 2 (the amplitude of
D
the oscillations grows exponentially with time for the larger dynamo number and decays
with time for the smaller D). The eigenvalue problem (A,B exp( iωt)) gives two

the first of which corresponds to non-decaying oscillations. Let us consider how this
solution changes with allowance for small variations of the αˆ-parameter with time:
αˆ = 1+εa(t), (8)
where ε 1 is the amplitude of the parameter perturbations and a 1. On eliminating
≪ ∼
A from equations (5), we find
B¨ +2B˙ +(1+2i+2iεa(t))B = 0. (9)
The problem of parametric resonance concerns periodic variations of the parameter

including the (real) growth rate s and frequency shift ∆ω. The approximate solution
(11), (12) is valid for the small ratio ε/γ 1. It can be seen from the equation (12) for
≪
s that either exponential growth (for γ > √8) or decay (for γ < √8) of the oscillations is
possible.
It is of course possible to solve Eq.(10) numerically to confront the computations
with our approximate analytical solution. Figure1 gives examples of such a comparison
for decaying and growing oscillations. The initial conditions for the computations were
B = 1 andB˙ = i(fort = 0).Equations (11) and(12) show thatthemainconsequence of

the parametric modulation - of the first order in ε - is the deformation of the oscillations’
shape. Variation of the oscillation amplitude is the second-order effect. Part (a) of the
Fig.1 clearly shows the oscillation asymmetry: negative deflections have larger amplitude.
The oscillations grow exponentially for sufficiently large frequency γ. The growth does
not mean a resonance, however. The dependence of the growth rate s on the modulation
frequency γ ofEq.(12)issmoothanddoesnotshowanyselected frequencies characteristic
of the resonant phenomena. There is, therefore, no parametric resonance in the dynamo.
The reason for this can be seen by comparison of the equation (9) with the Mathieu
equation for the parametric resonance, which for further discussion is convenient to write
as

(Landau & Lifshitz 1969). The case with dynamo is different (part (b) in Fig.2). There
is only one eigenvalue (7) for non-damped oscillations. Displacements to the left or to the
right by the value γ on the frequency axis from this eigenfrequency, shown by the upper
bows in the part (b) of the Figure, do not lead to other eigenfrequencies. The next step of
the perturbation technique should be undertaken to get a finite growth rate. This second
step gives once again displacements to the left and right on the frequency axis shown by

the lower bows in Fig.2(b). The second step of the perturbation technique returns to the
original eigenfrequency to give a finite growth rate of the order ε2 (12). This happens
for any modulation frequency γ. Parametric modulation in a dynamo is, therefore, ‘not
selective’ in γ, i.e. it is not resonant. Parametric resonance is probably possible only for
systemswithnotlessthantwoeigenfrequencies ofnon-dampedoscillations,andaresonant
frequency equal to the difference between these eigenfrequencies.
We turn now to the case of a(t) in equation (9) being a random function of time.
For this case, the equation has to be solved numerically. Random function with known
statistical properties can be realized with the equations

to one. The number is renewed on each time step independent of its preceding value. The
function g represents a short-correlated random process but a(t) is a smooth function of
time with zero mean. For short ∆t τ, it represents a stationary (in the statistical sense)

its initial value is typical of linear oscillation with stochastically varying parameters
(Klyatskin 1980). Figure 3 also shows this type of behaviour. The diffusive wandering of
the dynamo-wave amplitude is by all probability not realistic. It is stabilized by nonlinear
effects, to the account of which we now turn.
HYSTERESIS IN NONLINEAR DYNAMOS
Dependence of the coefficients of the equation (5) on the magnetic field is now allowed
for. The dynamo-wave approximation can still be applied to the nonlinear problem if the
coefficients αˆ and ηˆ are the functions of the amplitude β = B of the wave (see Noyes et
| |
al. 1984 for more details). The equation system (5) is no longer reducible to one equation
similar to Eq.(9) in the nonlinear problem.
Instead of the Eq. (8), we now have for the αˆ-coefficient
15 4β2 1 β2
αˆ = (1+εa(t)) 1 − arctg(β) , (16)
32β4 − 3(1+β2)2 − β !
where the dependence on the magnetic field is prescribed after the prediction of the quasi-
linear theory of the α-effect (Ru¨diger & Kitchatinov 1993). Magnetic quenching of the
α-effect is usually the only nonlinearity in dynamo models. It suffices for stabilizing the
filed growth. The αˆ value decreases with increasing β. The effective dynamo number,
considered as a function of the magnetic field, reduces to its critical value to stabilize the
field growth.

However, not only the α-effect but the eddy diffusion as well can depend on the
magnetic field. Quasi-linear theory of turbulent transport coefficients predicts

forthedependence (Kitchatinovetal.1994).Theηˆ,aswellasαˆ,decreases steadilywithβ.
The effective dynamo number = αˆ/ηˆ2, however, is no longer a monotonic function

field growth still takes place. For small β 1, however, the effective dynamo number
≪
increases with the field strength. This leads to the hysteresis phenomenon.
Fig. 4. Illustration of hysteresis in nonlinear dynamos. In the range of 0.6 < < 2, the

equations (5) with the coefficients (16) and (17) have two stable solutions of i) oscillations
with a steady and relatively large amplitude β > 1, and ii) decaying oscillations of small
amplitude. The dotted line shows the watershed between the ‘attraction regions’ of these
two solutions.
Intheabsence ofα-effectfluctuations (ε = 0inEq.(16)),there aretwo stablesolutions
of Eqs.(5) in the range of the dynamo numbers 0.6 < < 2 realised depending on the
D
initial condition. Figure 4 illustrates this situation. Computations for a series of increasing
dynamo numbers and a small initial amplitude β show decaying fields up to dynamo
number = 2. When the number reaches its critical value of = 2, the decay is

replaced by fieldgrowth. This leadsto anincrease inthe effective dynamo-number andthe
10
amplitude of the eventually steady oscillations jumps to a finite value of β > 1. A further
increase in dynamo number results in a smooth increase in the amplitude. If the dynamo
number is then changed to a decrease and the amplitude of the preceding computation
is taken as the initial condition, oscillations of finite amplitude survive for < 2 up to
D
= 0.6 but decay indefinitely for still smaller < 0.6. The equation (β) = 2 for

the amplitude of the dynamo-wave has two solutions in the range of 0.6 < < 2. The
D
solution of the relatively small amplitude is however unstable. This solution is shown by
the dotted line in Fig.4. This line is the boundary between the ‘attraction regions’ of the
oscillations with steady andrelatively largeamplitude (full line) anddecaying oscillations.
Dynamo waves decay if their initial amplitude is below the dotted line. Above this line,
the amplitude grows initially and then stabilizes.
Fluctuations in dynamo parameters can provoke irregular transitions between the two
solutions. This possibility attracts attention in connection with the two modes of solar
activityinferredbyUsoskinetal.(2014)fromthecontentofcosmogenicnuclidesinnatural
archives. The distribution function of the amplitudes of solar cycles for about 11 thousand
years that they obtained has two maxima. Such a dual distribution was interpreted as a
manifestation of two distinct modes of solar activity.
RecentlyKaraketal.(2015)foundthedynamo-hysteresisin3Dnumericalexperiments.
Their computations near the critical dynamo number show an irregular intermittency of
magnetic cycles of relatively large amplitude with weak-field epochs. However, the time
consuming 3D computations did not provide sufficiently vast statistics of magnetic cycles
for finding their distribution function. This can be done with the simplified dynamo-
equations of this paper. Figure 5 shows the distribution function for one million magnetic
cycles computed by solving numerically equation (5) with allowance for the nonlinearities
ofequations(16)and(17)andtheα-effectfluctuationsofmodel(14).Thedualdistribution
function is qualitatively similar to that found by Usoskin et al. (2014) from historical data
on solar activity.
It may be noted that the dynamo-hysteresis and irregular transitions between dynamo
modes with different amplitudes of magnetic cycles are not restricted to the special case of
thenonlinearities ofEqs. (16)and(17).Thehysteresis ispresent whenever thedependence
of the ratio αˆ/ηˆ2 on the magnetic field has a maximum, e.g., for the simplest model of

CONCLUSION
Thesimplest approximationoftheshortdynamo-wavesofthispapercertainlydoesnot
allowquantitativereproductionofobservationsofsolaractivity.Thisshouldbethesubject
of detailed numerical models. However, the approximation allows analytical solutions,
which can be useful in interpreting the results of the numerical computations. Variations
of solar activity, including such impressive phenomena as its Grand minima, are related
to fluctuations in dynamo parameters. The majority of models for the Grand minima
assume the characteristic time of the fluctuations equal to the duration of the (11-year)
activity cycle, i.e. to a half of the entire 22-year magnetic cycle that corresponds to the
12
doubled frequency of the magnetic cycle. An enhanced response to fluctuations of such
duration as expected for parametric resonance was not found however. Solution of the
parametric modulation problem for dynamo-waves shows that parametric resonance is
not present in dynamos. Exponential growth or decay of the wave amplitude depending
on the frequency of the parametric variations is possible but a selective sensitivity to
special frequencies characteristic of the resonant phenomena does not come out. This is
related to peculiarities of the dynamo mechanism (cf. Fig.2 and the discussion around).
It becomes clear why the Grand minima statistics can be reproduced with either durable
(Moss et al. 2008) or rapidly varying (Olemskoy et al. 2013) fluctuations. The fluctuation
parameters should be inferred from observations.
The dynamo-wave approximation turns out to be useful also in the problem of the
origin of the two modes of solar activity indicated by the new data (Usoskin et al. 2014).
The two modes may be explained by the hysteresis in nonlinear dynamos ( Kitchatinov
& Olemskoy 2010; Karak et al. 2015). Hysteresis is also found in the dynamo-wave
approximation,whichpermitsitsdetailedanalysis(Fig.4).Incontrasttomorecomplicated
models, computations with this approximation are not numerically demanding. It is
therefore possible to accumulate the statistics of computed magnetic cycles sufficient
for constructing a distribution function of the cycles’ amplitudes. A dual distribution is
obtained qualitatively similar to that found by Usoskin et al. (2014) from radiocarbon
data on solar activity.
