The Free-Energy Principle (FEP) [1, 2, 3] has been adopted in a varie ty
of ambitious proposals that aim to characterize all adaptive, sentie nt, and
cognitive systems within a unifying framework. Judging by the amoun t of
attention it has received from the scientiﬁc community, the FEP has gained
signiﬁcant traction in these pursuits. The current target article r epresents
an important iteration of this research paradigm in formally describin g emer-
gent dynamics rather than merely (quasi-)steady states. This aﬀ ords more
in-depth considerations of the spatio-temporal complexities of cr oss-scale
causality – as we have encouraged and built towards in previous public ations
(e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). In this spirit of constructive feedback, we s ubmit a few
technical comments on some of the matters that appear to requir e further
attention, in order to improve the clarity, rigour, and applicability of this
framework.
Certain idiosyncratic deﬁnitions and derivative statements in this pa per
and prior works have tended to confuse scientists who attempt to assess the
validity of such formulations in depth. As the authors aimed to formu late a
robust Bayesian mechanics by borrowing from physics, particular c are needs
to be taken concerning physics terminology.
In the target article, much of the authors’ argument relies on wha t they
deﬁne as “generalized coordinates”, eﬀectively a vector containin g higher-
order time derivatives of motion of a (sub)system, which can be use d to

approximate its local dynamics under certain limiting assumptions, on some
(unspeciﬁed) time scale. While the authors’ usage appears to be int ernally
consistent, it may generate confusion with respect to a particular analytical
method that physicists hold dear. When grappling with complex dynam ical
systems, many hours of work can be saved by applying a state-spa ce reduction
and exploiting the coordinate-agnostic ﬂexibility of Lagrangian mech anics,
where “generalized coordinates” and “generalized velocities” refe r to q and
˙q, respectively, in the Lagrange equation of the second kind: d
dt ( δL
δ ˙qj
) = δL
δqj
.
In that context, carefully choosing a set of generalized coordinat es is a
highly context-speciﬁc and technical task in itself that can simplify d eriva-
tions of physically meaningful constraints on a system’s dynamics (e .g., a
textbook example: shifting to angular coordinates to eﬀectively mo del a
pendulum; see [10]). If the authors intend to engage the physics co mmunity
eﬀectively and avoid unnecessary confusion for novel readers, it would seem
expedient to choose a diﬀerent label, or else clearly explain diﬀerence s from
common (physics-textbook) linguistic use.
Such an apparently innocuous mixing of terms can engender furthe r mis-
understandings, leading to breakdowns in communication between ﬁ elds. For
example, consider the following quote from the target article: “In this setting,
the Lagrangian plays the role of an action, where paths of lea st action min-
imize the Lagrangian of generalized states.” (p.36) This quote would make
most physicists frown because the action is commonly deﬁned as the path
integral of the Lagrangian – as acknowledged by the authors (see also [11]).
Within the conﬁnes of the target article, however, “generalised st ates” are
deﬁned such that they implicitly characterize local paths, which mea ns that
the Lagrangian of all derivatives can be seen as specifying an (implicit ) action
of sorts (valid only to the extent that a Taylor series approximation holds).
More generally speaking, many claims throughout the article contain tacit
assumptions, often leaving the reader to reverse engineer what a dditional de-
tails the authors might have had in mind that could help constrain their
claims. For example, consider this sentence: “We make no assumptions
about the solutions of this equation, other than the ﬂow oper ator does not
change over some relevant time interval.” (p.38). Since the formulation itself
consists of postulates and approximations with unclear boundary c onditions,
it becomes diﬃcult (or impossible) to evaluate individual claims. In their
pursuit of generality, most concepts have been left either uncons trained or
deﬁned in a self-referential manner. In extension, the same holds for solu-
2
tions, as exempliﬁed above: the authors assumed that solutions ha ve ﬂow
operators that do not change on relevant time intervals without sp ecifying
what degrees of change might be considered signiﬁcant and what kin ds of
time intervals could be “relevant”. One might wonder under which con di-
tions a Taylor series will (still) provide satisfactory approximations w hen
considering systems that display cross-scale itinerancy. There ar e likely dy-
namical regimes where such polynomial approximations must be exte nded
with periodic components, but currently, the blanket response wo uld be to
simply postulate “relevant” time scales at which the Taylor series is en ough.
The need for precise semantics becomes critical when the FEP claims
delve into complicated topics such as agency and sentience. The wor ds auton-
omy and agency are used interchangeably, but there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between systems driven by meaningful internal dynamics [12], and systems
that are capable of planning in order to achieve explicitly represente d goals;
thus, it remains important to recognize the diﬀerence between tele ology vs.
’mere’ telonomy [13, 14, 15].
In the article, the authors invoke notions of ”strange particles” a nd the
circular causation involved in their beliefs about their self-generate d ac-
tions. This handling of ”self-evidencing” [16] may not only help speak t o
the “strange loops” characteristic of some complex adaptive syst ems, but
also to the deeper issues of life-mind continuity [17], and the recursiv e nature
of consciousness [18, 19].
The authors also allude to the concept of consciousness (using quo tes
from Heisenberg and David Bohm), but never clarify how it relates to their
deﬁnition of “sentience”. Connecting the behaviour of strange pa rticles with
’sentience’ might be premature, depending on the semantic scope o f this
concept. While self-evidencing systems can be considered to be sen tient in
that they are governed by information given valence by reference to self-
persistence, it is important not to conﬂate this with consciousness , lest we
risk being so inclusive with this concept as to compromise the utility of
considering the conscious properties of a system. If conscious br ains are
clearly a self-referential system, not all self-referential syste ms are necessarily
sentient or conscious.
Conscious experience likely requires complex network architecture s ca-
pable of supporting “integrated world modeling” [20, 21]. Such funct ional
properties may potentially be achieved in a variety of ways in diﬀerent kinds
of ”particles,” such as through information bottlenecks emerging f rom com-
plex attractor dynamics [22]. However, to reliably ground such infer ences
3
about the potential conscious properties of a system, it is require d that we
both deeply engage with models of consciousness for systems for w hich we
know there are subjective experiences, as well as precisely chara cterize the
phenomenology (in the sense used by physicists) of systems that m ay realize
such qualitative aspects by other means.”
To associate the functionalities (and perhaps phenomenality) of ”s en-
tience” with particles may generate further confusion by both imply ing the
kinds of panpsychism the authors explicitly renounce, as well as pot entially
suggesting a kind of illegitimate eliminative reductionism concerning the
values of agents with conscious experience (e.g. the ”as if” languag e used
throughout the paper for the ontological status of particles with goals).
In conclusion, this FEP-based formalism presented by Friston and c ol-
leagues oﬀers an intriguing perspective on life and cognition, but man y con-
ceptual nuances still need to be addressed. This painstaking proc ess could
eventually allow the authors to do justice to the complex systems th ey want
to describe and the global and interdisciplinary community of academ ics they
aim to engage.
