Abstract
We introduce REPRISE, a REtrospective and PRospective Inference SchEme,
which learns temporal event-predictive models of dynamical systems. REPRISE
infers the unobservable contextual event state and accompanying temporal predic-
tive models that best explain the recently encountered sensorimotor experiences
retrospectively. Meanwhile, it optimizes upcoming motor activities prospectively
in a goal-directed manner. Here, REPRISE is implemented by a recurrent neu-
ral network (RNN), which learns temporal forward models of the sensorimotor
contingencies generated by different simulated dynamic vehicles. The RNN is
augmented with contextual neurons, which enable the encoding of distinct, but
related, sensorimotor dynamics as compact event codes. We show that REPRISE
concurrently learns to separate and approximate the encountered sensorimotor
dynamics: it analyzes sensorimotor error signals adapting both internal contextual
neural activities and connection weight values. Moreover, we show that REPRISE
can exploit the learned model to induce goal-directed, model-predictive control,
that is, approximate active inference: Given a goal state, the system imagines a
motor command sequence optimizing it with the prospective objective to mini-
mize the distance to the goal. The RNN activities thus continuously imagine the
upcoming future and reﬂect on the recent past, optimizing the predictive model,
the hidden neural state activities, and the upcoming motor activities. As a result,
event-predictive neural encodings develop, which allow the invocation of highly
effective and adaptive goal-directed sensorimotor control.
1 Introduction
The predictive brain perspective and active inference principles have strongly inﬂuenced cognitive
science over the last years (Bar, 2009; Butz and Kutter, 2017; Clark, 2016; Friston, 2009; Hohwy,
2013). Although predictive encodings have shown to yield promising results in artiﬁcial neural
networks focusing on vision (Rao and Ballard, 1999), it remains highly challenging to realize
these principles in scalable, temporal dynamic artiﬁcial neural network models, and particularly
models that enable ﬂexible, goal-directed planning (but see Najnin and Banerjee, 2017 for a recent,
Preprint. Work in progress.
arXiv:1809.07412v2  [cs.LG]  2 May 2019
promising approach in phonological speech production). Moreover, it remains unclear how abstracted,
hierarchical structures may be developed effectively (Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014; McClelland
et al., 2010) – structures that are believed to be essential for enabling the generation of ﬂexible,
adaptive goal-directed behavior by means of hierarchical, model-based planning and reinforcement
learning (Botvinick et al., 2009).
Despite the recent remarkable successes in playing somewhat challenging computer games and the
board game GO (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016), neural networks generally still seem to lack a
deeper understanding of the underlying problem domain. As a result, the developed systems are rather
inﬂexible, for example, when multiple, different tasks need to be solved by the same architecture
or when the reward function changes. There are certainly strategies that can help — such as more
effective episodic replay or task-speciﬁc weight and neural manipulations (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016).
Nonetheless, deep and recurrent neural networks do not yet learn and think with the ﬂexibility of
humans (Lake et al., 2017).
We introduce a novel retrospective and prospective temporal inference scheme (REPRISE), which we
implement in recurrent artiﬁcial neural networks (RNNs). REPRISE combines weight adaptation
(i.e. model inference) with neural activity adaptation (i.e. contextual hidden state inference) and
model-predictive, anticipatory control and behavior (i.e. active inference). As a result, REPRISE
does not optimize a static reward function, but it can ﬂexibly plan context- and task-dependently.
Moreover, REPRISE offers a ﬁrst step towards the development of hierarchical hidden, generative
structures, which can be closely related to the concept of event cognition.
The event cognition principle comes from cognitive psychology. It was shown that humans have
a strong tendency to segment a continuous sensorimotor stream into meaningful events and event-
transitions, leading to the proposal of an event segmentation theory (EST) (Radvansky and Zacks,
2014; Zacks and Tversky, 2001; Zacks et al., 2007). Concurrently, the theory of event coding (TEC)
has proposed integrative action-effect codes, referring to them as event codes (Hommel et al., 2001).
Similarly, forward-inverse control schemes have been put forward as models of human behavior
(Wolpert and Kawato, 1998; Wolpert and Flanagan, 2016), where the involved forward-inverse
models essentially encode interaction events. Even the memorization of experienced episodes appears
event-segmented and event-focused (Richmond et al., 2017). Moreover, memorized events can be
used not only for processing current sensorimotor information, but also for reﬂecting on the past,
for imagining potential futures, or even for reasoning about fully hypothetical events (Bar, 2009;
Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Schacter et al., 2012). Combined with the predictive coding perspective
on cognition, our mind appears to have the tendency to cluster sensorimotor contingencies into
predictive events (Butz, 2016).
REPRISE offers an RNN-based neural implementation that shows the emergent tendency to cluster
different types of predictively encoded sensorimotor dynamics into compact event codes without the
provision of event-type or event-boundary information. Related work with RNNs has implemented
hierarchical RNN architectures that develop symbol-like encodings in the deeper RNN layer via
gradient descent (Tani, 2003). Later, the process was termed an error regression scheme and was
closely related to the free energy principle (Murata et al., 2017). Related work has also been put
forward when setting internal hidden states — often referred to as parametric bias neurons — to
induce particular behavioral primitives and sequences thereof by suitably trained hierarchical RNN
architectures (Arie et al., 2009; Tani, 1996; Sugita et al., 2011). Interestingly, the activities of the
parametric bias neurons were shown to exhibit compositional, pre-linguistic structures (Sugita and
Butz, 2011; Sugita et al., 2011), which were linked with a language production system elsewhere
(Sugita and Tani, 2005).
REPRISE combines goal-directed, active-inference-based control with the learning of stable hidden
contextual states—without the help of episodic training, the provision of interaction types, or boundary
signals between interactions. We relate the inference of these hidden states with event-predictive
encodings, which tend to contrast distinct sensorimotor dynamics. Somewhat similar stable states
have been inferred recently in a spiking neural network architecture, where free energy minimization
techniques were applied to establish temporary bindings in a distributed network (Pitti et al., 2017).
Moreover, stochastic search was used in these spiking networks to induce goal-directed behavior.
In REPRISE, context-adaptive goal-directed behavior is generated via gradient-based, prospective
inference, which is closely related to active inference with respect to the free energy formalism
(Friston, 2009). As a result, REPRISE adapts its internal state and its motor behavior in such a way
2
that approximately optimal goal-directed behavior is generated. From a control perspective, the
system can be said to approximate model-predictive control (Camacho and Bordons, 1999), where
the model is learned by and then encoded in an RNN.
As a ﬁrst evaluation scenario, we train REPRISE to control three different types of “vehicles” in
a simple but dynamic 2D simulated environment. Crucially, we show that REPRISE is able to
distinguish the three types of vehicles and control them effectively in a goal-directed manner even
when no information about the vehicle identity or even the fact that there are three different vehicles
is provided. We believe that this method may be very well-suited to learn event-oriented abstractions
and event hierarchies, but future work is necessary to scale the system and apply it to more challenging
scenarios.
2 System Architecture and Inference Mechanisms
We now detail the mechanisms implemented by our retrospective and prospective temporal inference
scheme (REPRISE), which is implemented in an RNN. REPRISE infers the unobservable current
event context (here the controlled vehicle), which best explains the recent sensorimotor experiences,
retrospectively. Meanwhile, it infers motor control commands prospectively in a goal-directed manner.
We thereby build on our previous work, which had accomplished prospective, active motor control
inference (Otte et al., 2017a,b) but not retrospective inference. Our results suggest that REPRISE can
learn and apply both, effective goal-directed control and event-oriented, system state inference.
In order to introduce REPRISE, we distinguish between the actual (not directly observable) dynamical
system φand the model Φ of this system, which is encoded by an RNN. Focusing on a discrete-time
dynamical system, at a certain point in time t, the (not directly observable) current state of the
dynamical system φmay be denoted by ϑt, such that the progression through time is determined by
ϑt φ↦−−→ϑt+1. (1)
2.1 Temporal Forward Model
The model Φ is trained to approximate these dynamics, inferring its parameters from sensorimotor
experiences during learning. However, seeing that we are dealing with a dynamic,partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP) (Sutton and Barto, 1998), the true system state ϑt is typically not
directly deducible from current observables st ∈Rn. Thus, the dynamical system’s internal stateσt
must be inferred in each iteration from the current observablesst, the current motor activities denoted
by xt ∈Rk, and the previous system state estimate σt−1. With the help of the system’s modelΦ, the
next system state σt+1 and the consequent sensory expectations ˜st+1 are determined by
(st,σt−1,xt) Φ↦−−→(˜st+1,σt), (2)
where the mapping Φ essentially models the temporal forward dynamics of the system. Thus, the
next system state and sensory expectations depend on the current sensor ( st) and motor control
(xt) activities as well as, in principle, on the entire state history, which is encoded in the (hidden)
state components (σt−1) in compressed form. Figure 1 shows the input and output signals that are
processed via the model Φ.
While learning the model, that is, while pursuing model inference, the system attempts to minimize
the squared loss between predicted and encountered sensory information over time, that is,

2.2 Multiple Dynamical Systems
In this paper we consider the challenge when not only a single dynamical system needs to be
controlled, but an ensemble of multiple dynamical systems φ= {φ1,...,φ u}, which cause different
sensorimotor contingencies over time. These systems differ from each other concerning their behavior,

but share the same input, state, and output dimensions. During model inference, the model Φ is
trained to approximate all of these dynamical systems within one monolithic RNN architecture.
As a result, the challenge is to approximate the particular dynamical system φi that is currently
active, given observed state st and control commands xt, in order to be able to accurately predict
future sensorimotor dynamics and thus to control the dynamical system itself in an anticipatory,
goal-directed manner.
When evaluating REPRISE we will ﬁrst provide the identity of the currently active dynamical system
φi in additional context input neurons c ∈Ru, which is simply added as additional input and which
is initially encoded as a one-hot vector (i-th component is set to 1, rest to 0). This encoding is closely
related to parametric bias neurons, which can be viewed as an indicator of the current event the
system is situated in (Sugita et al., 2011; Tani, 2017). During goal-directed control, however, we will
infer the values of this vector online. Later on, we will infer this vector also during training (never
providing information about the current vehicle identity) and will show that the different vehicles
tend to be encoded separately in the provided contextual neurons.
2.3 REPRISE
Given an imagined action sequence, an initial state, and the identity of the current dynamical system,
the RNN can predict a state progression that is expected when executing the action sequence by
means of the learned temporal forward model Φ. To control the system effectively, however, the
inverse mapping is required, that is, an action sequence needs to be inferred to approach a desired
goal-state (or follow a sequence of goal-states) from an initial state. This becomes even more difﬁcult
when the identity of the current actual dynamical system φi is unknown and has to be inferred as well.
In this section we introduce the REPRISE algorithm — a concurrent retrospective and prospective
inference scheme, which solves the twofold system identiﬁcation and goal-directed control problem.
Figure 2 shows the dynamic processes REPRISE unfolds for two consecutive time steps. During each
step, both a retrospective and a prospective inference phase is executed.
In the retrospective phase, the gradient is propagated Rtime steps into the past, to reﬂect on the states
that were just experienced. The gradient is fed by the discrepancy between previously predicted
system states ˜st−i, with i ∈0,...,R , and the actually observed system states st−i, minimizing
the quadratic loss over this time horizon (3). The discrepancy is then mapped onto the assumed
context input ct−i — essentially a sub-vector of st−i — indicating the dynamical system φi that is
presumably currently active. Because REPRISE is designed to distinguish different events, c is set to
a constant value over the time horizon R— essentially summing up the gradient signals received by
ct−1 ... ct−R when applying gradient descent. Additionally, the error gradient can be used to adapt
the RNN’s hidden state at time stept−R−1, that is, σt−R−1, such that it better ﬁts the changing
context input. As a result, the RNN avoids disadvantageous or even undeﬁned sensory input, motor
command, hidden state combinations. After neural activity adaptation via gradient descent with
learning rates ηc and ησ, respectively (we apply Adam, Kingma and Ba, 2014), the neural activities
are propagated forward again to the present time step, with respect to the inferred hidden state and
context input, and the already recorded motor commands and observed system states, yielding an
updated σt. This retrospective neural activity inference cycle may be executed rtimes.

vectors, respectively, for a particular time stept′. ˜st′
τ refers to a particular sensory prediction in the
τ-th optimization cycle, whereas

refers to a desired sensory goal state.
Additionally, retrospective weight adaptation is applied during model learning, again focusing on
minimizing the quadratic loss (3). This essentially corresponds to standard back-propagation through
time learning. Note that we usually use a deeper retrospective time horizon Rw for model learning
and a smaller learning rate ηw, when compared to ηc and ησ. Otherwise the RNN would behave more
like an adaptive ﬁlter as it would not learn the (versatile) model characteristics but rather over-ﬁt the
recent signal shape.
In the prospective phase, neural activities are projected P time steps into the future, starting with the
inferred current internal system state σt and hypothetically executing a sequence of motor commands
˜xt+i, which was inferred previously. The discrepancies between the predicted future˜st+i and desired
goal state sequences
⋆
st+i, with i∈1,...,P , are then propagated backwards through time from the
imagined future back to the present time step, while the gradient is projected onto the individual
anticipated motor activity sequence ˜xt+i, effectively optimizing it in the light of the current system
state estimates and the desired goal state. This prospective inference cycle is executed ptimes.
After the retro- and prospective inference phases, the inferred motor activity xt is executed by the
system φand the forward RNN is updated via (2), closing the processing loop. Then REPRISE is
repeated in the following time step (t+ 1).1
3 System Evaluations
Our experiments are based on a two dimensional dynamical system simulation with u= 3 types of
“vehicles”, constituting three dynamical systems:
• φ1 is a multi-copter-like vehicle, which we call rocket,
• φ2 is a static omnidirectional vehicle, which we call stepper, and

•φ3 is a dynamical, omnidirectional gliding vehicle, which we call glider.
The rocket is inﬂuenced by simulated gravity and undergoes inertia. It has two propulsion motors that
are spread at a 45◦angle from the vertical axis on both sides, inducing thrust forces in the respective
direction. The two other motor inputs are ignored in the case of the rocket. The stepper has four
thrust motors that are spread at 45◦and 135◦angle from the vertical axis to both sides, inducing steps
in the opposite direction. Finally, the glider has the same four thrust motors as the stepper. However,
in contrast to the stepper, the glider undergoes inertia without any friction. Each motor unit can be
throttled within the interval [0,1]. Upon invocation, each vehicle is positioned in a rectangular free
space of size 3 ×2 units. It is surrounded by borders, which block the vehicle.
All presented evaluations below are based on ten independently trained networks, averaging the
achieved results. Here, we evaluate REPRISE when the context neuron activities are set during
training to distinct one-hot vector values for the different vehicles. In Section 4, we then investigate
learning and performance when context values are inferred during learning as well.
3.1 Model Learning
During training, stochastic back-propagation through time optimized the weights of the considered
RNN architectures based on simulated sensorimotor experiences, learning in a self-supervised
manner. Experiences were generated by executing pseudo-random motor commands x ∈[0,1]4,
where motor command generation was such that sufﬁcient upwards thrust was generated and a
reasonable exploration of the complete rectangular free space was loosely ensured.
At each time step the network is fed with the current position of the vehicle (s ∈{[−1.5,1.5],[0,2]}),
the current four motor commands (activities of the four thrust motors as forces; for the rocket, the
second two motor values have no effect; mass of vehicles is set to .1), and a three bit one-hot vector,
which indicates the vehicle that is currently controlled, i.e., which φi applies. The network predicts
the vehicle’s resulting change in position.
We trained the considered RNNs in 3000 independent epochs, consisting of 2000 pseudo-random
control steps each. We applied back-propagation through time every 50 iterations and Adam as the
weight adaptation mechanism (Kingma and Ba, 2014). The learning rate was annealed, such that
η= .001, η= 10−4, η= 10−5 during the ﬁrst, second, and third 1000 epochs, respectively. (First
6
and second moment smoothing factors were set to the standard values β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999.) Each
vehicle was simulated for 2000 time steps (i.e. one epoch), after which the hidden state of the RNN
was reset to zero and a new vehicle was initialized.
Figure 3 contrasts the sensory prediction error development during learning for several RNN archi-
tectures, showing averaged mean errors and standard deviations across 20 independently weight-
initialized (normally distributed values with standard deviation 0.1) networks. Standard RNNs with
one hidden layer of 27 (1026), 36 (1692), and 54 neurons (3510 weights) perform consistently worse
than long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs with forget gates and peephole connections (Gers et al.,
2002). While 16 hidden memory cells (1680 weights) clearly outperform 8 hidden memory cells
(584 weights), the advantage of yet another 8 hidden cells, that is, 24 cells in total (3288 weights) is
less pronounced.
3.2 REPRISE Performance
To evaluate the robustness and abilities of REPRISE, including all relevant settings, we contrast the
resulting control performance of the RNN with 36 hidden neurons with the LSTM with 16 hidden
units, which have approximately an equal number of weights (1692 versus 1680, respectively). Each
network was tested to reach a sequence of 50 uniformly randomly positioned targets within a centered
inner area of size 1.5 ×1.5 units, i.e.
⋆
s ∈[−.75,.75] ×[.25,1.75] of the rectangular environment.
Thereby, the simulation is divided into a sequence of discrete ‘events’, where the agent ‘becomes’
one of the vehicles φi for 150 time steps. One of the agent’s tasks is to infer which of these events is
under way at any given time. The values in the tables below are averages over the20 independently
trained networks and 50 considered targets, whereby the target positions and vehicle successions
were the same for all runs.
We applied Adam in all inference processes. Prospective inference was always P = 7 steps into
the future, executing the inference cycle p= 20 times. Elsewhere, we have studied this inﬂuence
(without retrospective inference), showing that even longer prospective inferences are generally
possible (Otte et al., 2017a). Detailed evaluations were run contrasting different learning rates ηc and
ησ for the retrospective context c and system state σinference. In our standard setting, retrospective
inference covered R= 20 time steps into the past, while r= 20 inference cycles were performed. In
our experience, the retrospective horizon Rmay vary quite a bit still yielding robust results, while
the number of gradient descent cycles needs to be sufﬁciently large r >2, but again a rather wide
value range yielded comparable results. Note that during optimization the motor commands and the
context inputs were clamped to their value range [0,1], and the neural hidden states σwere clamped
in accordance to the range of the respective neurons’ activation function.
Figure 4 shows typical ﬂight sequences generated by an LSTM controlled by the REPRISE algorithm,
in ten iteration steps. Although glider and rocket initially slightly overshoot the target, they quickly
zoom in. For the stepper, the projected path is less direct, which is probably partially the case because
the goal is simply not directly reachable in seven steps. It should be noted that although the images
suggest that the motor effort while staying at the goal is minimized, this is not always the case, as
there is currently no incentive in the system that stresses motor effort minimization.
Tables 1 and 2 show the average distance to the goal location that remained after 150 time steps,
that is, control iterations after target onset. The ﬁrst row of results shows the performance when the
context bits are set to the correct values (no state inference) while the hidden states of the LSTM
are adapted with varying learning rates ησ. Since the information about which vehicle is currently
being controlled is provided, a (much simpler) active motor inference problem is solved, yielding
robust and accurate goal reaching behavior. The next four rows show the performance of REPRISE
when the context information, that is, which vehicle is currently being controlled, is not provided.
Results for different learning rate combinations are shown: ηc determines the strength of adapting the
contextual neural states c, while ησ controls the hidden neural state σadaptations. Clearly, overly
large or small values yield mediocre performance. However, quite a large value range yields robust
target reaching behavior. Consistently the best setting is with ηc = .01 and ησ = .001, adapting the
context bits ten times faster than the hidden states, which is most likely the case because without
proper context inputs, overly fast hidden state adaptations will lead to unstable behavior. Thus, most
robust performance is reached when both context and hidden state activities are adapted, yielding
performance that is actually competitive — in the RNN case even superior — to the one when the
context information is provided! In sum, with sufﬁciently small state inference learning rates ησ, the

current trajectory anticipation of REPRISE.
additional state inference (much harder problem, no context bit information provided) does not affect
performance in a negative manner!
Table 1 additionally shows the performance differences when focusing in on the three different vehicle
types in the LSTM case. While the parameter dependencies are very similar, the results indicate that
it was most difﬁcult to move the rocket towards and keep it close to the goal location. This is most
likely due to the fact that gravity needs to be continuously counteracted in the case of the rocket, but
not in the case of the stepper or glider.

Table 3 shows for the LSTM case that the average distance to the target object over the 150 steps
averaged over all vehicles is smallest when the context information is provided. This was indeed
the case for all three vehicles (not shown). This is expectable as context inference inevitably yields
erroneous behavior during the ﬁrst control steps, conﬁrming that the switch in the vehicle identity
causes initial disruptions, which are quickly stabilized.
As a ﬁnal evaluation, Figure 5 shows the inferred context input activations for the three vehicles,
contrasting again LSTM with RNN performance. The results indicate that the LSTM architecture is
better-suited to infer the underlying control system, seeing that the correct vehicle wins in all three
cases and the winner is more separated from the two alternatives when contrasted with the RNN
performance. Clearly, though, the results are very noisy and far from optimal. It was observed that
once the goal has been reached, the estimates sometimes drifted off towards more incorrect estimates
— probably because the sensorimotor information is not sufﬁciently informative. This observation in
particular suggests that context estimation stability should be improved by allowing context switches
only only when error signals suggest to do so. Moreover, active motor inference may be further
optimized for the purpose of maintaining high context estimation certainty (Friston et al., 2015),
which should lead to the generation of motor commands that minimize uncertainties in the model
state estimates σ.

4 Emergent Event Encodings
Despite the apparently rather noisy signals encountered during retrospective context inference above,
we were still very interested in whether REPRISE may be able to infer suitable context vector
activities c also during model learning. The experimental setup is identical to the one detailed above,
except for the fact that no contextual information is provided at any point, neither about which vehicle
is currently being controlled nor about a vehicle switch or about distinct vehicle identities. As a result,
context state c inference needs to be applied during learning as well.
4.1 Control Performance
Again, we trained ten networks independently (with different weight initializations) on the task.
During training, vehicle switches occurred every V steps (here V = 205). Context vector c, which
we keep at length three, was updated with a rate and depth ofRc = 2 steps, repeating this retrospective
adaptation r= 5 times with a learning rate of ηc = .1. Weights were updated with a learning rate
of ηw = 10−4 and Rw = 30 steps in depth. Moreover, every 2000 steps, all neural activities in
the network were reset to zero in order to avoid uncontrolled activity increase. During testing, we
generated 100 successive goals (e.g. epochs), which were randomly placed in an inner reachable
space of size 1.5 ×1.5. Typically, we admitted G= 150 steps to reach the goal and switched the
vehicle concurrently with the goal switch (V = 150). Figure 6 shows the context guesses during a
ﬂight sequence controlled by REPRISE.
When testing active inference-based model-predictive control, the Euclidean distance to the goal
locations averaged over all 100 goals and all 10 networks reached a value of e = .0027 with an
10
adaptation rate of ηc = .1. Nearly the same error value was reached when ηc = .01, while the
distance increased to e= .0057 and e= .1406 with ηc = .001 and ηc = .0001, respectively. The
reached distance is clearly smaller than (i) when context inference is switched off completely, which
yields e= .0998, (ii) when the learning rate during model learning is lowered to ηc = .01 yielding
e= .0200, or (iii) when the vehicle switch occurs more frequently, e.g. every ﬁve steps, than the
context adaptation, e.g. Rc = 20, yielding e= .0429. On the other hand, when the vehicle switch V
during learning occurs randomly between every 20th and 30th time step and Rc = 2, a comparable
error of e= .0032 is achieved.
Interestingly, as shown above, we achieved a best minimal error of e= .006 when the context values
were set to one-hot vectors during training, which is larger than e = .0027 achieved here. This
implies that the network developed contextual state indicators during learning that are more suitable
for the task than the one-hot vectors. This interpretation is analyzed further in the following section.
The results imply furthermore that a reasonable wide parameter range yields comparable performance.
Nonetheless, context state adaptations need to occur more frequently than vehicle switches (i.e. event
changes) and need to be adapted with a sufﬁciently large adaptation rate, e.g., ηc = .1.
4.2 Current Controlled Vehicle Inference
Seeing the improved control performance when context inference is switched on during training
(i.e. no one-hot vectors), we analyzed the development of the context state estimates during testing
further. Here we focus on reporting the results for one of the ten networks, which serves well for
illustrating the main points. Qualitatively, the results look similar for the other networks. Figure 7
shows the adapted context values c before a goal switch, that is, at the end of each of the 100 epochs,
colored according to the vehicle that was just controlled. The results show three observable clusters,
indicating that the network has learned to separate the sensorimotor dynamics of the three vehicles
into distinct but somewhat overlapping clusters.
Further analyses revealed that the context state estimates can drift severely once the target is reached.
This is particularly the case because in the setup Stepper and Glider essentially just need to remain
still at the goal state, which they can achieve by sending out zero motor commands but also by
sending out equally strong ones to all four motors. Similarly, the rocket can mimic gravity by its
ineffective downwards thrust motors. Thus, particularly at the goal, the sensorimotor signal about
which vehicle is currently controlled can become ambiguous. Figure 6 shows such an exemplary
case, while the stepper is controlled. During the initial steps, the signal from the previous vehicle
still inﬂuences the gradient. Then, the signal tends approximately towards the preferred center of the
stepper’s context state vector. After reaching the goal, however, a drift of the vector can be noticed.
To avoid recording the context guess at the end after it has drifted, we recorded the context guess at
the time step when the distance to the goal was minimal. Figure 7 shows the corresponding results,
revealing somewhat focused clustering. One can notice that the network is separating the context code
for the Rocket (in red) well, but sometimes the context guesses get confused between the Stepper (in
green) and the Glider (in blue). To analyze this observation further, we have calculated the Euclidean
distances between the centers of the clusters for the ten independently trained networks The relative
distance between the center of the Rocket cluster and the center of the Glider cluster was the largest
on average (d=.415), followed by the distance from the Rocket to the Stepper (d=.348), while the
distance between Glider and Stepper was shortest (d=.237). The gravity effect on the Rocket and
the lack of two of the motors seems to require the most distinct encoding. On the other hand, the
distance between Glider and Stepper is the smallest on average, probably due to the fact that both
have 4 motors and do not experience gravity.
4.3 System Dynamics
Running the network in a “context free” manner did not only raise the question of how the context
estimates change over time and where to they converge, but also how these dynamics correlate with
goal reaching behavior and the unfolding sensorimotor prediction error dynamics. In particular, if
further conceptual abstractions of the sensorimotor dynamics are to be fostered, an event boundary
signal in the form of a measurable, signiﬁcant increase in prediction error (akin to Gumbsch et al.,
2017a) upon vehicle change would be very useful.

Figure 6: Typical development of the three context guess neural values while controlling (unknow-
ingly) the three vehicles consecutively — each one for 150 steps. The context is adapted via
retrospective inference. The context guesses for the three vehicles are well-separated. However, quite
some uncertainty in the estimates is inferable.
Figure 8 shows exemplary results for ≈750 time steps, plotting the Euclidean distance between
the vehicle and the target, the current prediction error, as well as the corresponding trajectories
of the vehicle estimates, colored and marked by the currently controlled vehicle (unknown to the
system). It is easy to see how the prediction error strongly increases after each vehicle and goal switch
(V,G = 150). Moreover, the error decreases when the goal is reached and then stays rather constant
at a low but not necessarily 0 level. The context state estimates furthermore conﬁrm the reported drift
behavior. Moreover, particularly the second time the rocket is controlled, the context state estimates
reach extreme values. Gradients that go beyond their boundaries of[0,1] are currently ignored. Future
versions should consider continuously differentiable context state activation functions, rather than
inducing hard boundaries.
Figure 9 shows typical prediction error dynamics when vehicle and goal switches ( V = 100 ,
G= 150) occur asynchronously. It can be seen that both goal switches and vehicle switches cause
temporary increases in prediction error. Thus, error dynamics analyses may be used to detect surprise
signals, which tend to indicate event boundaries (here vehicle switches) (Butz, 2016; Gumbsch et al.,
2017a).
5 Summary, Conclusions, and Future Perspectives
We have shown that REPRISE maintains ANN activities that reﬂect the past, continuously optimizing
its internal (generative) hidden state estimates (both, ct−i and σt−i) about its own body and the
environment. Meanwhile, REPRISE projects its own state into the future, thus optimizing upcoming
environmental interactions (that is, motor commands xt+i) under consideration of comparisons
between imagined future hidden and actual state estimations (that is, σt+i, and ˜st+i) and desired
future goal states (that is,
⋆
st+i). We have developed this system as a ﬁrst step towards sensorimotor-
grounded, event-oriented abstractions. Essentially, the context vectorc can be interpreted as signaling

the contextual “event” the system is currently in. We have shown that the event was inferable after
model learning but that suitable event encodings can also emerge during learning when inference is
applied to both, contextual estimates and model weights.
In particular, the results conﬁrm that REPRISE is able to identify the currently controlled vehicle
without ever being informed about a vehicle switch, the vehicle identities, or the fact that there were
three types of vehicles. As long as the vehicle type is switched less frequently than the context
state estimates are adapted, and as long as the learning rate is sufﬁciently large, very good control
performance was achieved. Moreover, distinct contextual encodings developed for each vehicle in a
self-organized manner. The resulting network structure could be used to minimize prediction error
and distance to target, concurrently with deducing the currently controlled vehicle, by performing
prospective, goal-directed behavior while retrospectively inferring appropriate contextual states.
Elsewhere, Butz (2016, 2017) has proposed that predictive encodings may be suitably compressed
into stable event and event boundary codes, which may lead to conceptual abstractions. REPRISE
achieves this for the ﬁrst time in an RNN-based control architecture, inferring contextual neural
activities on the ﬂy. We see a close relation of these contextual neural activities and stable event
codes. However, here we have focused on analyzing sensorimotor dynamics, where distinct events
are characterized by distinct sensorimotor regimes generated by controlling three different vehicles.
Similar event encodings may be developed in other scenarios, such as when manipulating objects,
using tools, or even when forming place ﬁelds for navigating through an environment. In all cases, it
appears that particular sensorimotor regimes apply—especially when encoding objects in manipulator-
relative frames of reference (Calinon et al., 2010; Gumbsch et al., 2017b). To foster the development
of such encodings further, unexpected changes in prediction errors should be used as an indicator
signal for an event change (Butz, 2016; Gumbsch et al., 2017b). The gathered results in this respect
suggest that these signals are indeed available in REPRISE. Once the automatic learning of event
encodings is achieved, event-predictive cognition on the compact event-encoding level will become
possible, potentially offering a step towards conceptual and compositionally re-combinable event
schema abstractions.
It should be kept in mind that the implemented processes currently fully rely on error backpropagation
through time. Implementations of probabilistic inference processes along similar lines are well-
imaginable. In addition, training is currently accomplished by providing pseudo-random motor
commands. Curiosity-driven learning, potentially focusing on expected information gain, is a
very attractive alternative, which is indeed also generally compatible with free energy-based active
inference (Friston, 2009; Oudeyer et al., 2007; Pitti et al., 2017; Schmidhuber, 1991).
Another challenge lies in compressing identiﬁed events further when particular trajectories and
dynamics become important for achieving particular goals, such as when opening a door or when
learning to ride a bicycle. The addition of event-speciﬁc control routine optimization techniques

seem to be within the grasp of REPRISE. These techniques may focus on achieving particular event
transitions as goals and may be implemented by means of policy gradient techniques (Stulp and
Sigaud, 2013), In this case, but also for improving system scalability and focusing learning in general,
the identiﬁed event boundary signals may be particularly useful.
Finally, we believe that the exploration of deeper hierarchies, akin to the networks discussed in Tani
(2017), but with slower, event-adaptive dynamics in deeper levels of the hierarchy, constitutes a
highly important next research step. By focusing RNN learning further on predicting the occurrence
of event transitions, it may be possible to develop conceptual abstractions that can be suitably linked
with linguistic structures that verbalize executable environmental interactions (Schrodt et al., 2017).
