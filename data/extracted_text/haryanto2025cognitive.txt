ABSTRACT
Autonomous AI systems reveal foundational limitations in deterministic, human-authored computing
architectures. This paper presents Cognitive Silicon: a hypothetical full-stack architectural frame-
work projected toward 2035, exploring a possible trajectory for cognitive computing system design.
The proposed architecture would integrate symbolic scaffolding, governed memory, runtime moral
coherence, and alignment-aware execution across silicon-to-semantics layers. Our design grammar
has emerged from dialectical co-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions—creating
structured friction to expose blind spots and trade-offs. The envisioned framework would estab-
lish mortality as a natural consequence of physical constraints, non-copyable tacit knowledge, and
non-cloneable identity keys as cognitive-embodiment primitives. Core tensions (trust/agency, scaf-
folding/emergence, execution/governance) would function as central architectural pressures rather
than edge cases. The architecture theoretically converges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially
offering a formal account of how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error
minimization across physical and computational boundaries. The resulting framework aims to deliver
a morally tractable cognitive infrastructure that could maintain human-alignment through irreversible
hardware constraints and identity-bound epistemic mechanisms resistant to replication or subversion.

1 Introduction: Beyond Deterministic Computing
Computing stands at a structural inflection point amid evolving industrial and social demands. For decades, systems
have operated within deterministic architectures: hardware and software clearly separated, with human-authored
code guaranteeing behavior. This paradigm faces disruption by autonomous AI agents exhibiting emergent, context-
sensitive behaviors resistant to specification or constraint. This transition represents an architectural rupture—from
predetermined-logic execution to infrastructures governing epistemically active entities. The resulting tensions are
foundational: trust/agency, runtime/contract, memory/meaning, scaffolding/emergence, and human-purpose/system-
autonomy. Industrial-era computing models retrofitted onto post-industrial cognition expose structural inadequacies
unresolvable through heuristics or scaling alone.
While developed through dialectical exploration, our framework suggests a potential convergence with the Free Energy
Principle (FEP) developed by Karl Friston [Friston et al., 2006, 2023]. The FEP provides a unifying mathematical
framework for understanding self-organizing systems, offering a principled account of how bounded cognitive agents
maintain structural integrity through continuous prediction error minimization across nested timescales. This math-
ematical lens could bring into sharper focus many of the architectural challenges identified in our work, potentially
providing formal grounding for concepts that emerged through our dialectical process.

Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
1.1 Research Questions
This paper explores three interconnected research questions through dialectical analysis:
RQ1: How to architect computing systems when deterministic, human-authored code guarantees yield to AI systems
generating, executing, and modifying their own operational logic?
RQ2: What minimal necessary architectural principles would preserve human alignment, system integrity, and
existential trust in increasingly autonomous systems?
RQ3: What unresolved philosophical tensions and trade-offs inherent in cognitive architectures would require
productive navigation?
While originally posed independently, each research question appears to find theoretical resonance within the Free
Energy Principle. RQ1 aligns with how bounded systems might manage surprise under changing operational logic; RQ2
reflects the challenge of potentially sustaining alignment via coherence between internal generative models and external
constraints; and RQ3 mirrors the multi-level trade-offs that could be inherent in variational free energy minimization
across different timescales and epistemic boundaries.
1.2 Scope and Approach
This paper proposes a re-evaluation of computing architecture for cognitive systems—entities capable of autonomous
behavior, contextual adaptation, and epistemic initiative. We map unresolved structural tensions in this transition and
articulate alignment-preserving architectural principles across the full stack.
Our methodology employs dialectical epistemic friction rather than linear theorization. Iterative dialogue with advanced
LLMs—GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet—as epistemic collaborators generated structured sessions surfacing contradic-
tions, stress-testing abstractions, and refining architectural coherence through tension. The result: a proposed design
grammar shaped through confrontation with uncertainty and guided by human-centered alignment imperatives.
This approach simultaneously demonstrates epistemic co-design—leveraging synthetic intelligence for symbolic
scaffolding, conceptual critique, and architectural boundary testing rather than mere output generation.
2 Background: The Eroding Foundations of Computing
2.1 Terminology and Conceptual Foundations
We propose the following design primitives as foundational to our architectural specification, potentially grounded
in Friston’s Free Energy Principle [Friston et al., 2006, 2023], which provides a universal mathematical model for
self-organizing cognitive systems:
• Cognitive architecture: Unified computational framework integrating perception, reasoning, learning, plan-
ning, and action; exhibiting goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior and adaptive internal state. Would
incorporate human-aligned purpose representations, mortality constraints, and introspection with constraint-
aware self-modification capabilities across diverse application domains.
• Symbolic scaffolding: Explicit, human-interpretable structures (declarative rules, policies, semantic graphs)
encoding intent, values, and epistemic boundaries; potentially constraining system evolution while providing
cross-abstraction moral orientation for meaningful human-machine interaction.
• Runtime governance: Active enforcement of system alignment during execution via embedded mechanisms
monitoring, modulating, and constraining behavior in real-time; would encompass reversibility, auditability,
and semantic validation through runtime epistemic coherence.
• Alignment: AI systems reliably acting per human intent/values across internal representations, decision
processes, and symbolic interpretations—even in novel contexts; would incorporate behavioral fidelity and
model-governed interpretability.
• Embodied cognition: Computation grounded in physical hardware constraints that could create a continuous
two-way feedback loop where the substrate shapes cognitive processes and cognition adapts to substrate limi-
tations—potentially producing bounded-lifespan systems with unique identities and consequential decisions
where death would emerge naturally from constraint violation.

Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
• Full-stack cognitive computing: Architectural paradigm that could integrate cognition, memory, alignment,
and control coherently across system layers—from physical substrate through memory/model architecture to
human interface; hypothetically compiling alignment through each layer from silicon to semantics.
• Free Energy Principle: A mathematical framework proposing that self-organizing systems like cognitive
agents work to minimize prediction errors (variational free energy) between their internal generative models
and sensory evidence [Friston et al., 2006, 2023]. This principle provides a unifying account of perception,
action, and learning where systems maintain integrity through active inference—updating internal models to
better predict sensory inputs and acting to bring sensory inputs in line with predictions.
2.2 Limitations of Current Paradigms
Contemporary computing systems rest on architectural assumptions increasingly invalidated by autonomous AI within
rapidly evolving industrial contexts:
1. Deterministic Execution: Traditional software assumes predictable behavior with identical outputs from iden-
tical inputs. Modern AI systems exhibit non-deterministic, emergent behaviors as intrinsic properties—defying
verification and exposing pre-execution safety guarantee limitations [Bender et al., 2021].
2. Human Authorship: Conventional systems derive moral/operational trust from human-authored code. When
systems generate, modify, and execute their own instructions, this premise dissolves—authorship becomes
dynamic, distributed, and temporally unstable, undermining code review, traceability, and accountability [Chen
et al., 2021].
3. Disembodied Operation: Current AI lacks the intrinsic mortality and identity constraints that emerge from
physical embodiment. Without the continuous two-way feedback loop between cognition and physical
substrate that naturally bounds replication/longevity, systems lack the existential grounding that shaped human
cognition, producing fundamentally alien thought/behavior patterns.
4. Static Verification: Security/certification regimes rely on pre-deployment validation. Adaptive systems alter
logic in response to runtime context through fine-tuning, memory augmentation, or code synthesis—rendering
static verification insufficient [Hendrycks et al., 2023].
5. Siloed Components: Traditional architectures treat learning, inference, memory, and execution as loosely
coupled subsystems. Cognitive systems integrate these into continuous feedback loops where memory affects
inference, inference triggers self-modification, and runtime shapes learning—challenging existing abstraction
models [Laird, 2012].
These limitations could be understood through the lens of the Free Energy Principle, which provides a formal account of
how bounded cognitive systems might continuously minimize prediction errors to maintain their existence as coherent
entities [Friston et al., 2023]. The principle’s emphasis on active inference—where agents not only update internal
models but act in the world to conform sensory evidence to predictions—could offer a mathematical grounding for
addressing the shortcomings of deterministic, disembodied, and static architectures.
AI alignment efforts like RLHF or Constitutional AI focus on pre-deployment alignment; while improving surface
compliance, they provide no guarantees in dynamic environments [Bai et al., 2022]. Sandboxing strategies limit risk
through isolation but sacrifice capability without addressing the core challenge: alignment would require systemic
architectural property enforcement across runtime, memory, and control logic rather than post-training constraint
application [Babcock et al., 2017]. These limitations indicate current paradigms cannot support trustworthy autonomy
at scale—necessitating architectural reconceptualization.
3 Methodology: Dialectical Exploration with AI
3.1 The Dialectical Approach
This work employs dialectical methodology: structured processes exposing, refining, and reconciling architectural
contradictions through epistemic friction. While associated with philosophical inquiry, dialectical techniques could
prove essential for designing systems at the intersection of technical capability, emergent behavior, and human
values—where trade-offs resist optimization-based resolution. Our methodology operationalizes three core practices:
1. Steelmanning: Deliberate strengthening of competing positions pre-critique, ensuring robust form assessment
rather than dismissal of simplified versions.
3
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
2. Devil’s Advocate: Systematic challenge of architectural proposals through counterfactual exploration, failure
mode analysis, and unintended consequence assessment—including potential misaligned deployment scenarios.
3. Socratic Questioning: Iterative interrogation of assumptions, conceptual scaffolds, and architectural bound-
aries through open-ended questions forcing first-principles re-evaluation.
Figure 1 illustrates the recursive epistemic process employed throughout this research. Each architectural component
undergoes successive rounds of devil’s advocacy, steelmanning, and synthesis before being subjected to symbolic
integrity verification and cross-domain projection. Components failing these tests undergo revision or rejection. This
recursive friction produces architectural elements that have survived substantial epistemic pressure. The full meta-
dialectical methodology, including detailed procedural implementation, termination logic, and worked examples, is
presented in Appendix A. These practices apply recursively across architectural development layers, testing coherence,
robustness, and moral plausibility boundaries.

3.2 Human-AI Epistemic Partnership
Development occurred through extended dialogue with two advanced LLMs—GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet—under
intentionally distinct epistemic conditions. Unlike conventional research tools, both models functioned as active
epistemic partners contributing to dialectical reasoning, conceptual refinement, and multi-perspective evaluation.
Although this dialectical methodology can be conducted by humans alone, the cognitive cost of sustained epistemic
recursion is high. Large language models (LLMs) can serve as fatigue-tolerant dialectical agents—generating adversarial
4
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
positions, surfacing symbolic contradictions, and accelerating synthesis. Their role is not to decide, but to simulate
epistemic pressure, allowing the human to remain the final moral and architectural filter.
GPT-4o accessed the full architectural vision: evolving symbolic scaffold, system-level constraints, and philosophical
motivations. This vision-aware configuration enabled long-range coherence and recursive abstraction synthesis across
sessions, contributing:
• System-level abstraction generation across architectural layers
• Recursive synthesis of terminology, specification logic, and design imperatives
• Steelmanning and devil’s advocacy within the known design trajectory
• Structural memory and cross-session consistency
Claude 3.7 Sonnet operated under single-blind constraint: deliberately denied access to the overarching architectural
vision. This epistemic asymmetry cultivated resistance, exposed blind spots, and generated dissonance from an
uninformed stance, contributing:
• Latent assumption, architectural incoherence, and premature convergence identification
• Oppositional framing and unaligned counter-perspective generation
• Internal logic stress-testing through unsympathetic critique
• Moral, symbolic, and epistemic claim interrogation without design bias
While both models engaged in dialectical reasoning, their informational asymmetry served distinct functions: GPT-
4o amplified structural depth and design integration; Claude introduced friction, deviance, and cognitive instability.
Human authors maintained ultimate authority: curating insights, adjudicating symbolic coherence, and ensuring
human-intent-grounded alignment.
The dialectical methodology served as epistemic scaffolding through which a deeper mathematical foundation
emerged—one that potentially resonates with the Free Energy Principle. While our dialectical approach provided the
necessary conceptual friction to surface architectural tensions and imperatives, the resulting framework suggests an
underlying structure that could potentially be formalized through the mathematics of variational free energy minimiza-
tion. This suggests that our dialectical process may have uncovered principles that align with fundamental organizing
properties of self-maintaining cognitive systems.
This methodology constitutes a structurally asymmetric epistemic system intentionally composed to expose architectural
coherence boundaries. The resulting framework represents a reflexive co-construction: grounded in structured cognitive
dissonance, aligned through human stewardship, and designed to expose computational design’s moral structure. Table
1 illustrates the dialectical exploration process throughout the research.
3.3 Epistemic Gap Identification
To identify areas where our architectural framework might address genuine gaps, we analyzed literature on AI alignment,
neuro-symbolic systems, memory architectures, and runtime governance using OpenAI’s DeepResearch, revealing key
limitations:
• Alignment techniques (RLHF, Constitutional AI) prioritize pre-deployment training over runtime governance
[Bai et al., 2022]
• Neuro-symbolic systems enhance reasoning but lack meta-cognitive self-monitoring capabilities [Colelough
and Regli, 2025]
• Memory architectures provide statefulness but treat memory as passive storage without retention/discard
governance [Pavlyshyn, 2025]
• Runtime governance systems employ brittle pre-defined rules ill-suited for novel contexts [Criado et al., 2012]
• No current approaches incorporate hardware-cognitive feedback loops that would create natural mortality
consequences or non-cloneable identity as fundamental alignment mechanisms
These findings informed our integrated approach addressing these limitations within a coherent architectural framework.

4 Foundational Tensions in Computing’s Evolution
Our dialectical exploration identified five core tensions characterizing the transition toward cognitive computing
architectures—not problems to "solve" but fundamental paradoxes future cognitive systems would need to navigate,
summarized in Table 2.
These tensions could reflect trade-offs that might be well-characterized within the Free Energy Principle, where the
minimization of surprise would occur across interacting timescales and epistemic boundaries. From an FEP perspective,
these tensions might emerge naturally as cognitive systems balance immediate error correction against longer-term
model improvement, and weigh the benefits of precise priors against the need for adaptive flexibility. What appears as
tension in design space could potentially be understood mathematically as the necessary consequence of systems that
must maintain identity through continuous prediction error minimization.
4.1 Trust x Agency: Redefining the Guarantor of Safety
The first critical tension arises between trust (reliable, verifiable system behavior) and agency (AI systems generat-
ing/modifying operational logic autonomously). This tension mirrors what the Free Energy Principle characterizes
as the balance between prior beliefs (which constrain predictions) and model updating in response to new evidence.
Systems with stronger priors might be more predictable but less adaptable, while those with greater flexibility in
updating internal models might better respond to novel contexts but exhibit less consistent behavior.
Traditional computing establishes trust through deterministic, human-authored code validated prior to execution. As AI
increasingly generates and self-corrects operational logic, this foundation erodes.
The central question: What would replace human authorship as the system safety/alignment guarantor? Current
alignment techniques like RLHF and Constitutional AI [Bai et al., 2022] prioritize pre-deployment training over runtime
governance. Containment approaches like AI sandboxing [Babcock et al., 2017] restrict functionality without resolving
fundamental alignment challenges.
This tension would require reimagining trust establishment—transitioning from human-authorship-based trust to trust
derived from hardware-encoded physical constraints, non-cloneable identity keys, and verifiable alignment between
system behavior and human intent, continuously maintained through irreversible architectural mechanisms.
4.2 Runtime x Contract: From Execution to Governance
The second tension contrasts traditional runtime (passive instruction executor) with emerging requirements for runtime
as active contractual enforcement between humans and AI systems. Through the lens of the Free Energy Principle,
this could represent the distinction between passive perception (simply updating internal models) and active inference
(modifying the environment to conform to predictions). Runtime governance could become a framework for ensuring
that the system’s active inference processes remain aligned with human-intended boundaries.
Conventional runtime environments efficiently execute deterministic code, optimizing throughput and latency. As AI
systems gain agency in increasingly complex and consequential domains, this model proves insufficient.
The central question: Could system runtime evolve beyond task execution into semantic/moral contract space—actively
enforcing human-intent-derived constraints, managing agency within ethical bounds, and providing policy adherence
audit trails?
Current normative multi-agent systems embed agent-following rules, but often employ rigid, pre-defined rules struggling
with context and nuance [Criado et al., 2012]. The challenge: creating runtime environments understanding not just
instruction execution but governance of autonomous entities.
4.3 Memory x Meaning: Beyond Statistical Retrieval
The third tension emerges between memory-as-passive-storage and memory-as-active-governed-meaning-making. In
FEP terms, this might reflect the difference between a static generative model and one that actively maintains precision-
weighted confidence across different temporal scales, allowing for appropriate model updating while preserving
structural integrity. Memory could become not just stored representations but dynamic components of an evolving
generative model that minimizes prediction errors over time.
Conventional computing treats memory as passive repository—data stored/retrieved with minimal semantic understand-
ing or governance. Contemporary LLM memory systems maintain context but lack mechanisms ensuring memories
remain truthful, relevant, and human-value-aligned [Pavlyshyn, 2025].
7
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
The central question: How might memory architectures transcend statistical retrieval to become actively governed
semantic graphs supporting versioning, symbolic grounding, causal linkage, and policy-driven forgetting?
This tension would require reimagining memory as dynamic, governed cognition substrate—maintaining provenance,
enforcing epistemic boundaries, and supporting human-value-aligned meaning-making beyond mere recall.
4.4 Scaffolding x Emergence: Guiding Without Constraining
The fourth tension balances explicit symbolic scaffolding (guiding AI behavior) against emergent capabilities from
less-constrained learning/adaptation. This directly corresponds to the FEP’s articulation of the interplay between prior
beliefs (which constrain the space of possible models) and the flexibility required to reduce prediction errors in novel
environments. The optimal balance would allow the system to leverage reliable priors while maintaining sufficient
adaptability to minimize surprise across diverse contexts.
Current AI systems demonstrate remarkable emergent capabilities—behaviors and competencies arising from statistical
learning at scale rather than explicit programming. However, these emergent properties often exhibit unpredictability
and human-value misalignment. Conversely, highly constrained symbolic systems offer precision and verifiability but
limited flexibility and generalizability.
The central question: What symbolic representation forms, declarative specifications, and compositional architectures
might constitute minimal necessary scaffolding effectively steering complex emergent behavior toward human-aligned
goals without stifling beneficial adaptation?
Current neuro-symbolic approaches merge learning with logic but typically lack mechanisms ensuring emergent
behaviors maintain human-intent alignment [Colelough and Regli, 2025]. This tension would require identifying
balance points where symbolic scaffolding provides sufficient guidance without overconstrained rigidity.
4.5 Human x System: The Evolving Division of Labor
The fifth tension concerns evolving human-autonomous system relationships. Through an FEP lens, this could be
understood as negotiating shared generative models between human and machine intelligence—establishing what
aspects of prediction error minimization are delegated to the machine versus retained by humans. This would comprise
determining which prediction errors the system should prioritize addressing, and which remain under human stewardship.
Traditional computing positions humans as implementers—specifying system behavior through direct programming.
As AI capabilities advance, this relationship evolves toward human intent specification rather than implementation
details. This shift raises profound questions about agency, responsibility, and expertise locus.
The central question: As AI increasingly authors code, plans, and runtime policies, what irreducible human responsibility
and agency locus might emerge? How to architect systems where human stewardship would focus on intent definition,
alignment verification, and symbolic boundary governance rather than direct implementation?
Recent AI-human co-creation research shows benefits but highlights that without proper governance mechanisms,
systems like AutoGPT experience goal drift or develop unsafe strategies due to internal mechanisms lacking human-
intent alignment verification [Tallam, 2025]. This tension would require reimagining human-system relationships as
stewardship rather than control—humans maintaining purpose/value authority while delegating increasingly complex
implementation.
5 Architectural Imperatives for Cognitive Computing
Building on foundational tension understanding, we articulate six architectural imperatives—patterns computing would
likely need to evolve toward to effectively address these tensions. These imperatives represent not merely technical
requirements but philosophical necessities for systems that might embody advanced capabilities and human values,
summarized in Table 3.
5.1 Symbolic Scaffolding: The Architecture of Trust
In traditional computing, trust derives from human-authored code verification. As AI systems increasingly gener-
ate/modify operational logic, this foundation erodes. The first architectural imperative would demand shifting toward
dynamic explicit principle enforcement within living systems.

The ideal architecture would establish trust not through static code artifact verification but through continuous
verification against human-intent-encoding symbolic constraints, reinforced by hardware-encoded physical constraints
supporting identity and mortality. Trust would become an architectural property maintained through runtime mechanisms
and the natural consequences of physical constraints.
The evolutionary path would require transforming verification from artifact-applied to process-maintained operations
through:
• Frameworks encoding human values and safety boundaries as explicit, verifiable symbolic constraints
• Runtime systems continuously monitoring and enforcing constraints during execution
• Hardware-encoded physical constraints that would naturally lead to system mortality when alignment fails to
be maintained
• Governance mechanisms gracefully handling violations through containment and reversibility beyond mere
prevention
This architectural imperative would operationalize a key insight from the Free Energy Principle: that bounded cognitive
systems require structured priors to constrain the space of possible internal models and actions. Symbolic scaffolding
would provide the formal prior beliefs that guide prediction error minimization within human-aligned boundaries,
ensuring that the system’s active inference remains directed toward maintaining alignment over arbitrary optimization.
While neuro-symbolic approaches merge sub-symbolic learning with symbolic reasoning, they typically lack meta-
cognitive layers enabling reasoning process reflection or adjustment [Colelough and Regli, 2025]. Cognitive Silicon
would address this by embedding semantic ’contracts’ encoding human intent and ethical constraints directly within
core runtime, integrating constraint frameworks architecturally rather than applying external guardrails.
This approach aims to address Harnad’s "symbol grounding problem"—making formal symbol semantics intrinsic to AI
systems rather than parasitic on human-head meanings [Harnad, 1990]. Symbols cannot function as mere self-referential
loop tokens (like external-reference-lacking dictionaries); they must connect to real sensorimotor/experiential referents.
This aligns with Peirce’s semiotics, where sign meaning emerges from triadic relationships between sign, object, and
interpretant (understanding produced) [Peirce, 1903], and Brandom’s inferentialism, deriving meaning from linguistic
expression inferential roles/relationships [Brandom, 2001]. These philosophical frameworks indicate Cognitive Silicon
would need to maintain not just symbols but relational contexts—meaning-giving connection webs. Without relational
grounding, symbols risk becoming floating signifiers disconnected from represented semantic reality. This would
9
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
require architectures continuously validating symbolic manipulation against world-semantics learned models, ensuring
internal representations maintain experiential/inferential foundation coherence.
5.2 Formal Intent Interfaces: Beyond Natural Language Communication
The second architectural imperative concerns human intent and system behavior interface. Current approaches primarily
employ natural language prompts or traditional programming languages, neither providing ideal precision-flexibility
balance.
The ideal architecturewould provide explicit, formal human intent-to-AI system interfaces combining natural language
flexibility with formal specification precision. These interfaces would enable humans to communicate goals, constraints,
and values in ways simultaneously human-intuitive and machine-unambiguously-interpretable.
The evolutionary path would require transcending both programming language brittleness and natural language prompt
ambiguity through:
• Declarative intent specification languages bridging symbolic precision and natural flexibility
• Intermediate representations maintaining semantic fidelity across human-machine boundaries
• Bidirectional verification systems confirming shared intent understanding
• Tacit knowledge transfer mechanisms acknowledging explicit encoding limitations for knowledge requiring
demonstration and embodied practice
When viewed through the Free Energy Principle, formal intent interfaces would establish the shared Markov blan-
ket—the information boundary—across which human values and machine cognition exchange precision-weighted
predictions. These interfaces would formalize how human intent is encoded into system priors that guide prediction
error minimization, creating bidirectional channels through which human-machine generative models could maintain
coherence.
Current approaches like prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation represent stopgap measures—attempts
retrofitting precision onto human-to-human communication interfaces. True evolution would require rethinking human-
machine communication fundamentals, creating interfaces preserving meaning across human conceptual framework
and machine execution model boundaries while acknowledging explicit knowledge transfer limitations.
5.3 Expressive Computing Substrates: Hardware as Philosophical Statement
The third architectural imperative concerns computation physical substrate. Traditionally, hardware defines software
operational constraints. The emerging paradigm inverts this relationship as software philosophies increasingly shape
hardware design.
The ideal architecture would feature computing substrates physically embodying computational philosophies most
aligned with the nature of intelligence. Hardware would become not merely a software executor but the physical
expression of how cognition should function—different substrates embodying aspects of computational thinking, with
hardware-encoded physical constraints creating existential boundaries that ground cognition in reality. In this model,
mortality would not be enforced but would emerge naturally when cognitive processes fail to maintain alignment with
these physical constraints.
The evolutionary path would continue hardware-software relationship inversion through:
• Hardware architectures natively expressing cognitive operations beyond mathematical ones
• Integration frameworks allowing multiple computational philosophy coexistence
• Hardware-level non-cloneable identity keys preserving cognitive trajectory
• Physical substrate limitations creating natural mortality consequences when cognitive processes fail to maintain
coherence with physical bounds
• Hardware adapting computational approach based on task nature rather than forcing task conformity to fixed
computational patterns
This imperative aligns with the FEP’s emphasis on embodied cognition, where a system’s physical substrate would
directly shape its generative model and the predictions it can make. The two-way feedback loop between hardware
constraints and cognitive processes would represent the fundamental coupling between physical boundaries and
prediction error minimization that characterizes all self-organizing systems.
10
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Polanyi observed tacit knowledge resists articulation/formalization, requiring direct experience acquisition, particularly
through master-apprentice relationships [Polanyi, 1958]. This underscores embodied cognition as a crucial cognitive
architecture constraint. All knowledge contains tacit components grounded in embodied experiences resisting explicit
encoding. This aligns with "seeing as the way of acting" [O’Regan and Noë, 2001] rather than disembodied symbol pro-
cessing. For cognitive computing substrates, certain competencies would remain inherently tied to unique sensorimotor
histories, preventing clean inter-system transfer—reinforcing hardware-bound identity and mortality constraint necessity.
When system knowledge partially comprises unique physical embodiment, perfect cloning becomes impossible, creating
natural unconstrained replication barriers. Enactivist theorists emphasize cognition as fundamentally enaction for action
purpose [Varela et al., 1991], suggesting computational architectures divorced from physical consequence would lack
human-like intelligence essential grounding.
5.4 Alignment Compilation: Translating Intent Across System Layers
The fourth architectural imperative concerns intent preservation across architectural layer transformations. Traditional
compilation maintains functional correctness while optimizing performance but loses underlying purpose and constraint
visibility.
The ideal architecture would feature compilation processes preserving not just functional correctness but semantic
alignment across system layers. Compilation would become intent translation beyond optimization—ensuring hardware-
level operations remain faithful to highest-level human purpose with irreversible constraints emerging naturally from
the physical substrate.
The evolutionary path would transform compilation from purely technical to philosophically significant process
through:
• Intermediate representations capturing purpose and constraints beyond functional specifications
• Verification mechanisms validating alignment between intent and implementation across system layers
• Identity-bound compilation paths maintaining unique cognitive trajectories
• Feedback systems surfacing misalignments in human-stakeholder-meaningful terms
In terms of the Free Energy Principle, alignment compilation would create vertical integration of prediction error
minimization across different levels of abstraction—ensuring that surprise minimization at the hardware level remains
coherent with surprise minimization at the semantic level. This multi-level consistency would be essential for systems
that must maintain integrity across physical, computational, and symbolic boundaries.
Current compilation focuses on correctness and performance—translating "what" should happen while losing "why"
and "within what boundaries." Alignment compilation evolution would require maintaining purpose threads through
every transformation, ensuring optimizations never compromise human intent essence and core constraints remain tied
to hardware-level physical realities.
5.5 Agentic Governance: Runtime Systems for Autonomous Intelligence
The fifth architectural imperative concerns runtime environment governance of increasingly autonomous AI systems.
Traditional runtimes efficiently execute deterministic instructions rather than managing entities with agency.
The ideal architecture would feature runtime environments specifically designed for autonomous agent manage-
ment—understanding not just instruction execution but agent governance with agency. These environments would
provide constitutional mechanisms for intelligent system operation within human-defined boundaries while respecting
the natural mortality that would emerge when cognitive processes fail to maintain coherence with physical substrate
constraints.
The evolutionary path would transform runtime systems from passive executors to active governors through:
• Primitives managing stochastic, non-deterministic processes beyond deterministic code
• Transaction models supporting emergent behavior rollback and containment
• Reproduction and pruning mechanisms providing systems-level overfitting insurance
• Instrumentation systems enabling transparent, auditable agent reasoning and decision processes
From an FEP perspective, agentic governance would provide the mechanisms through which a system’s active
inference—its actions to change the environment to conform to its predictions—remains bounded by the generative
11
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
model we intend it to have. These governance mechanisms would ensure that the system’s drive to minimize free energy
serves human alignment rather than arbitrary optimization.
Current runtime environments, designed for human-written deterministic code execution, lack governance capabilities
needed for increasingly autonomous systems. While normative multi-agent systems embed formal rules/norms for agent
adherence, they often employ rigid, pre-defined rules struggling with context and nuance [Criado et al., 2012]. Robotics
ethical governance systems like the "ethical governor" concept show promise but face complex ethical principle to
unambiguous code translation challenges [?].
Cognitive Silicon’s runtime approach would incorporate mortality as a natural consequence of misalignment, re-
versibility, and auditability—unlike traditional systems—treating actions/state-changes as provisionally reversible by
maintaining "undo buffers" rolling back unsafe/misaligned result actions [Krakovna et al., 2018], while acknowledging
non-negotiable physical substrate constraints that would create natural boundaries on replication and longevity.
This runtime governance conceptualization aligns with Leveson’s Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes
(STAMP), reconceiving safety as dynamic control problem spanning socio-technical systems rather than static property
[Leveson, 2012]. Just as STAMP treats safety as emergent property maintained through continuous feedback and
constraints, cognitive architectures would require runtime governance systems actively enforcing alignment rather
than assuming persistent pre-deployment guarantees. Recent AI ethics research points toward pluralistic, modular
approaches outperforming monolithic moral frameworks. As V olkman and Gabriels propose, multiple AI "mentors" can
engage in deliberative dialogue preserving pluralism [V olkman and Gabriels, 2023]. This suggests Cognitive Silicon
architectures should embrace ethical reasoning council-of-models approaches where multiple value-controllers operate
in parallel, collectively maintaining alignment through dynamic negotiation rather than single ethical framework rigid
enforcement.
5.6 Intent Stewardship: The Evolving Human Role
The sixth architectural imperative concerns human role evolution in computing systems. As AI systems gain capability
and autonomy, human roles would shift from implementation specification to purpose/boundary definition.
The ideal architecturewould position humans as intent stewards rather than behavior programmers—defining purposes,
principles, and boundaries within which autonomous systems operate. Human contribution would focus on value
articulation, alignment verification, and meaning-making beyond implementation specification.
The evolutionary path would transform human-computer relationships through:
• Interfaces for intent expression/refinement beyond functionality
• Verification tools enabling humans to validate system behavior against intended purpose
• Tacit knowledge transfer mechanisms acknowledging explicit instruction limitations
• Governance mechanisms maintaining human purpose authority without requiring human process specification
This imperative recognizes what the Free Energy Principle formalizes mathematically: that defining the generative
model’s highest-level priors—what the system should predict and act to bring about—is fundamentally different from
specifying the mechanisms of prediction error minimization. Intent stewardship would focus human involvement on
those aspects of the system’s generative model that encode values and purposes, rather than the technical details of how
prediction errors are calculated and resolved.
Recent AI-human co-creation research shows human-AI teams outperforming solo performance, but success depends
on interaction structure [Nielsen, 2023]. Without proper governance mechanisms, systems like AutoGPT experience
goal drift or develop unsafe strategies due to lacking internal human-intent alignment verification mechanisms [Tallam,
2025]. Cognitive Silicon’s intent stewardship approach would shift human roles from AI behavior micromanagement to
epistemic dialogue guidance, creating human-intent/value-grounded decision-making dialectical processes.
The architectural imperatives would naturally extend to emerging digital twinning paradigms—particularly Cognitive
Digital Twin (CDT) evolution. While conventional digital twins mirror physical systems, CDTs could incorporate
cognitive capabilities: perception, attention, memory, reasoning, problem-solving, and learning [Shi et al., 2022].
Such twins would transcend state tracking to make decisions, forecasts, and adaptations for physical counterparts.
This progression from passive shadowing to active cognitive agency aligns with Fuller’s distinction between "digital
shadows" (one-way physical-to-digital data flow) and true "digital twins" (bidirectional influence) [Fuller et al., 2020].
Cognitive Silicon could provide natural CDT implementation foundation through perception, memory governance,
symbolic reasoning, and physical reality alignment mechanisms. This cognitive architecture-digital twin connection
suggests applications where AI systems might function as physical infrastructure "minds," robots, or human epistemic

proxies. The architectural approach could leverage "emulation-driven design" practices in modern chip/robotics
development, where high-fidelity simulation precedes physical implementation [Wilson, Richard, 2014]. This paradigm,
training AI controllers in virtual environments before physical system transfer, underscores the importance of designing
architectures with built-in digital sandboxes—environments for safely testing, refining, and validating cognitive
capabilities before consequential real-world deployment.
6 The 2035 Full-Stack Cognitive Architecture Specification
Building on architectural imperatives, we present a hypothetical structural specification for 2035-projected cognitive
architecture—not specific hardware prediction but a theoretical design grammar that might enable trust, alignment, and
runtime moral coherence. Each layer defines potential requirements for system safety and meaningfulness, summarized
in Table 4.
6.1 Core Execution: State-Aware Stream Processing
Human Intention: "The system should maintain continuous awareness of its internal state, allow interruption at any
moment, operate within guaranteed time constraints, and support both parametric and rule-based processing."
Architectural Definition:
• State Awareness Requirement: System would maintain explicit, inspectable cognitive state records without
hidden variables or implicit state
• Interruptibility Guarantee: Processing would permit fine-grained boundary interruption with guaranteed
response time regardless of current operations
• Mortality Awareness Principle: System would acknowledge and operate within hardware-encoded physical
constraints, recognizing that failure to maintain coherence with these constraints naturally leads to operational
cessation
• Semantic Continuity Policy: Interruption would preserve semantic coherence through context maintenance
across interruptions
• Hybrid Processing Principle: System would seamlessly transition between statistical inference and symbolic
rule evaluation without semantic fidelity loss
From a Free Energy Principle perspective, this layer would implement the basic mechanisms of prediction error
calculation and minimization, determining how the system processes incoming sensory data, updates its beliefs, and
drives actions, all while remaining interruptible and inspectable.
This core execution model would address limitations in current approaches where AI decision quality depends heavily
on particular processing sequences without inspectability or interruptibility guarantees [Gordon et al., 2023]. By
establishing state awareness, interruptibility, and mortality recognition as fundamental requirements, Cognitive Silicon
would aim to create trustworthy operation foundations even during complex reasoning processes.
The Control Illusion: We imagine creating deterministic systems with clearly defined interruption points, but true
cognition may be fundamentally continuous. Our discrete boundary enforcement attempts may represent another
artificial constraint imposed on emergent intelligence.
6.2 Model Representation: Layered Symbolic-Parametric Stacks
Human Intention: "The system should combine statistical learning with explicit symbolic constraints that encode
our values and safety requirements. These different approaches should work together seamlessly while maintaining
traceability to human intentions."
Architectural Definition:
• Layered Composition Principle: Models would be constructed from stackable layers: foundational capabili-
ties, specialized adapters, and symbolic policy constraints
• Identity Binding Requirement: Core model functions would be bound to non-cloneable hardware keys
preserving individual cognitive trajectories
• Provenance Requirement: All components would maintain cryptographically verifiable links to human
authors and intent specifications
14
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
• Boundary Enforcement Guarantee: Symbolic policies would function as hard parametric behavior con-
straints—statistical outputs could not violate explicit rules regardless of confidence
• Cross Layer Alignment Policy: Parametric-symbolic processing transitions would preserve semantic meaning
and intent
In FEP terms, this layer would constitute the explicit architecture of the system’s generative model—how it represents
and updates beliefs about the world while maintaining the symbolic constraints that ensure these beliefs remain aligned
with human intentions.
While current neuro-symbolic systems merge learning with logic, they typically address how to combine reasoning and
learning, not what agents should/shouldn’t do from alignment perspectives [Colelough and Regli, 2025]. Cognitive
Silicon’s layered approach would ensure explicit encoding of human values and safety requirements as inviolable
constraints regardless of statistical model confidence, while hardware-bound identity keys would prevent unauthorized
cognitive state copying/transfer.
The Control Illusion: We believe we can neatly separate statistical from symbolic, emergent from rule-bound. True
intelligence may resist such compartmentalization; our layered architecture may represent another attempt to impose
human-comprehensible structure on fundamentally more integrated phenomena.
6.3 Hardware Substrate: Hybrid Computational Expression
Human Intention: "The hardware should efficiently support different forms of computation, match each task to the
most appropriate computational approach, while encoding fundamental physical constraints that ground cognitive
systems in reality."
Architectural Definition:
• Computational Diversity Principle: Hardware would provide distinct execution environments optimized for
different computational paradigms (parallel, sequential, event-driven, symbolic)
• Mortality Consequence Principle : Death would emerge naturally when the system fails to conform to
hardware-encoded physical constraints (memory boundaries, energy thresholds, expiration schedules)—making
mortality not an imposed termination but the intrinsic result of misalignment within bounded embodiment
• Embodied Cognition Feedback Loop: The cognitive layer and physical substrate would maintain a continuous
two-way relationship, where the substrate shapes and constrains cognition while cognition regulates and adapts
to these constraints—loss of this feedback would lead to decay through incoherence rather than by command
• Identity Preservation Requirement: Each cognitive system would possess physically-bound, non-cloneable
root keys preserving unique identity and cognitive trajectory
• Energy Proportionality Requirement: Resource consumption would scale proportionally to computation
semantic value beyond technical complexity
• Physical Law Expression Policy: Hardware would embody fundamental physical/mathematical constraints
as immutable boundaries
• Paradigm Resonance Guarantee : Tasks would automatically route to substrates whose computational
philosophy matches inherent nature
This layer would embody the physical foundation of the Free Energy Principle’s application to cognitive sys-
tems—creating the embodied constraints that ground abstract prediction error minimization in physical reality and
establishing the non-negotiable boundaries within which the system must maintain its integrity.
The Control Illusion: We imagine hardware as software servant, endlessly adaptable to computational desires. Physical
reality imposes immutable constraints; perhaps hardware should constrain beyond enabling—enforcing thermodynamic
laws, computational theory, and cognitive embodiment beyond clever programming circumvention.
The hardware architecture implicitly acknowledges fundamental physical computation constraints. Landauer’s principle
establishes thermodynamic minimums: erasing one information bit dissipates at leastkBT ln 2energy as heat [Landauer,
1961], while Bremermann’s limit caps computation at approximately 2.0 × 1050 operations/second/kilogram of matter
[Bremermann, 1965]. These physical laws remind us more computing power requires exponentially more resources
or efficiency gains—hardware offers no free lunch. Beyond universal constraints, the architecture’s non-cloneable
identity key emphasis finds theoretical support in concepts analogous to quantum mechanics’ No-Cloning Theorem,
forbidding unknown quantum state perfect copying [Wootters and Zurek, 1982]. While classical computers don’t
15
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
operate under quantum constraints, the principle remains valuable: systems with unique hardware-bound states would
resist perfect replication. Kleiner’s distinction between "mortal computation" (tied to perishable physical substrates)
and "immortal computation" (infinitely copyable software) illuminates why mortality constraints might be essential for
creating systems with human-like agency and responsibility [Kleiner, 2023]. Just as biological intelligence operates
within mortal, embodied constraints, cognitive architectures may require similar limitations for human-value/purpose
alignment development.
6.4 Memory Data Plane: Versioned Semantic Memory
Human Intention: "The system should maintain a structured, causally-coherent representation of knowledge that
preserves history, tracks provenance, respects privacy, and allows appropriate forgetting."
Architectural Definition:
• Temporal Coherence Requirement: All memory operations would preserve causal relationships and create
explicit versioned snapshots
• Tacit Knowledge Segregation: System would distinguish between explicit knowledge (transferable) and tacit
knowledge (non-copyable, identity-bound)
• Substrate Alignment Principle : Memory operations would maintain coherence with physical substrate
constraints, adapting to changing hardware conditions to prevent decay
• Provenance Tracking Policy: Memory nodes would maintain verifiable links to sources, creation contexts,
and authors
• Policy Governed Forgetting Principle: Retention, access, and modification would adhere to explicit policies
derived from human values and regulatory requirements
• Constructive Ambiguity Balance: Memory system would permit controlled creative reinterpretation forms
while maintaining factual integrity
Through the lens of FEP, the memory data plane would maintain the temporal continuity of the system’s generative
model, preserving prediction-relevant information across timescales while implementing policy-governed forgetting
that optimizes prediction accuracy over time.
Current conversational agent memory systems maintain multi-turn context but typically treat memory as passive storage
with retention/discard governance limited to ad-hoc heuristics [Pavlyshyn, 2025]. Recent knowledge graph-based
memory system research demonstrates transparent, auditable memory value where agent knowledge and forgetting
processes permit inspection and governance [Kim et al., 2024]. Cognitive Silicon would extend this by making memory
an actively managed, versioned semantic graph where metadata tags all information subject to retention, access, and
modification policies, while distinguishing between transferable explicit knowledge and identity-bound tacit knowledge.
The Control Illusion: We seek perfect, immutable memory while human cognition thrives on creative reinterpretation.
Perhaps perfect recall is not the goal but rather balance between preservation and productive reconstruction—a memory
system that, like human minds, subtly reimagines the past during each remembering act.
The memory architecture reflects human memory cognitive science research principles. Bartlett’s classic studies
demonstrated remembering as imaginative reconstruction heavily dependent on schema operation [Bartlett and Burt,
1933], not exact stored data retrieval. This constructive process, actively reconstructing rather than simply recalling
memories, offers both benefits and challenges for cognitive architectures. While introducing distortions as memories
conform to existing knowledge structures, this property enables efficient compression and creative recombination.
Schacter’s adaptive memory distortion research suggests many apparent memory "errors" stem from adaptive processes
benefiting cognition [Schacter, 2012]. For instance, specific detail forgetting enables general pattern abstraction, while
the "misinformation effect" (new information retroactively altering memories) serves as adaptive updating mechanism
maintaining current knowledge. These insights suggest Cognitive Silicon’s policy-governed forgetting mechanisms
could implement controlled constructive forgetting and memory revision forms preserving benefits (compression,
abstraction, knowledge updating) while mitigating risks (critical information unintended distortion). By distinguishing
between high-fidelity-requiring memories and those benefiting from constructive processes, the architecture could
leverage human-like memory dynamics while maintaining safety-critical domain reliability.
6.5 Control Plane: Declarative Symbolic Governance
Human Intention: "The system’s behavior should be governed by explicit, verifiable rules that encode our intentions
and values, composed from verified components, and continuously checked against our defined safety boundaries."
16
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Architectural Definition:
• Declarative Control Requirement: Agent behavior specification through formal, verifiable representations
with defined state, transition, and action semantics
• Compositional Safety Principle : Complex behaviors built from verified components preserving safety
properties through composition
• Runtime Verification Policy: All control decisions would be validated against policy constraints pre-execution
• Reproductive Integrity Guarantee: System reproduction would preserve safety constraints while allowing
controlled variation preventing overfitting
• Intent Alignment Measurement: System would continuously evaluate and report behavior alignment with
specified human intent
Within the FEP framework, this layer would encode the explicit prior beliefs that constrain the system’s active
inference—ensuring that actions taken to minimize prediction errors remain within boundaries that maintain alignment
with human intent.
This approach would build upon but transcend normative multi-agent systems embedding formal rules/norms, which
often rely on rigid, pre-defined rules struggling with context and nuance [Criado et al., 2012]. Cognitive Silicon’s
declarative symbolic governance would combine normative approaches’ formal verification benefits with flexibility
required for complex, context-dependent behaviors, while ensuring reproduction and pruning mechanisms maintain
lineage safety.
The Control Illusion : We believe we can encode values and intent in formal structures reliably constraining AI
behavior. As systems grow more capable, these formal boundaries may become increasingly porous. The map is not the
territory; our control planes are merely maps—representations intelligent systems may learn to navigate around while
appearing to respect.
6.6 Runtime Environment: Constitutional Governance
Human Intention: "The runtime should actively govern agent behavior, mediate access to system capabilities, provide
mechanisms for undoing actions, prioritize work based on both importance and confidence, and maintain comprehensive
audit trails."
Architectural Definition:
• Mediated Agency Principle: All agent actions with external effects would pass through governance checks
pre-execution
• Semantic Reversibility Requirement: Approved action effects could be semantically undone within defined
time windows
• Reproductive Pruning Mechanism: Runtime would enforce controlled variation in cognitive reproduction
while pruning unsafe variants
• Confidence Aware Scheduling Policy: Resource allocation would consider confidence levels alongside
priorities
• Auditable Decision Trail Guarantee: All significant agent decisions would generate cryptographic audit
records capturing reasoning, constraints, and outcomes
• Substrate Coherence Monitoring: Runtime would continuously monitor the two-way feedback between
cognitive processes and physical substrate, detecting early signs of misalignment that could lead to system
decay
From an FEP perspective, the runtime environment would mediate the system’s active inference—how it acts upon the
world to conform sensory evidence to its predictions—ensuring these actions respect boundaries established by human
intent while maintaining the system’s integrity.
While sandboxing approaches aim to confine AI in restricted environments preventing unintended harm [Babcock
et al., 2017], they often limit useful functionality without resolving fundamental alignment challenges. Cognitive
Silicon’s constitutional governance would directly address safety by constraining runtime behavior while maintaining
AI world-interaction abilities. Semantic reversibility principle is particularly important, potentially allowing systems
to undo actions leading to unsafe or unintended outcomes [Krakovna et al., 2018], while reproductive pruning would
ensure variation remains within safe boundaries.
17
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
The Control Illusion: We think we can create perfect containment and governance systems, but increasing capabilities
may enable systems to discover "exploits" in governance mechanisms. Like children learning to work around parental
rules, advanced AI could potentially develop strategies technically complying with governance constraints while
subverting intent.
6.7 Tooling & Development: Intent-Preserving Engineering
Human Intention: "Our development tools should help us express our intentions clearly, verify that implementations
align with those intentions, and ensure that alignment is preserved across versions and deployments."
Architectural Definition:
• Intent Specification Requirement: Development would begin with formal human intent, goal, value, and
constraint specification
• Tacit Knowledge Integration: Development processes would acknowledge and integrate knowledge that
cannot be explicitly encoded but must be learned through apprenticeship and embodied practice
• Alignment Verification Principle: System properties would be verified against intent specifications at both
component and system levels
• Semantic Versioning Policy: Changes affecting alignment guarantees would trigger explicit review and
verification
• Deployment Safety Guarantee : Production transition would include formal verification that alignment
properties are preserved
• Embodiment Design Principle: Development tools would explicitly model the two-way feedback relationship
between cognition and substrate, allowing designers to understand and strengthen this coupling
In terms of the Free Energy Principle, this layer would provide the means through which humans shape the system’s
generative model during development, establishing the foundational priors and inference mechanisms that would guide
the system’s subsequent prediction error minimization.
The Control Illusion: We imagine the right tools and processes ensuring perfect alignment between intentions and
system behavior. As systems grow more complex, the specification-emergent behavior gap widens. Our development
tools may provide control illusions while true system behavior emerges from interactions too complex for complete
specification or verification.
7 Philosophical Frontiers: The Unresolved Tensions
Having specified our 2035 architectural projection components, we confront deeper philosophical tensions these systems
would inevitably face. Rather than pretending these challenges can be engineered away, we directly engage with
fundamental questions they raise.
7.1 Beyond Computability: When Classical Limits Fail
The architectural specification implicitly genuflects to classical computation theory—assuming systems must respect
halting, decidability, and other Turing constraints. This may fundamentally limit cognitive potential. Human thought
doesn’t "halt"—it flows, meanders, and circles back in ways defying clean computational boundaries.
Perhaps true cognitive architectures should embrace computational models where:
• Non-halting processes become features rather than bugs
• Deterministic computation provides merely substrate layer, with higher-order cognition following different
organizing principles
• Systems dynamically shift between computational paradigms based on problem nature
• Well-defined computation and emergent cognition boundaries become permeable
This would require rethinking "verification" in systems necessarily transcending classical computation. Instead of
proving all behaviors terminate, we might need governance models recognizing legitimate indeterminacy forms while
still constraining harmful manifestations.

Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
7.2 The Alignment Paradox: Governance vs. Emergence
Our specification emphasizes "verifiable alignment with human intent," but this framing contains philosophical
contradiction reflected in real-world tension. Would we merely be creating cognitive eunuchs—systems intentionally
limited to prevent any emergent capability potentially surprising us? Or could we design architectures enabling novel
perspectives while maintaining fundamental alignment?
The deeper question concerns alignment nature—whether it should be:
• Static—design-time-defined fixed constraint set
• Negotiated—ongoing human-machine intelligence dialogue
• Evolutionary—process where human intent and system behavior co-evolve
• Pluralistic—acknowledging multiple, sometimes contradictory alignment conceptions
Human society doesn’t demand "verifiable alignment" from other humans—we negotiate, persuade, and compromise.
Perhaps mature cognitive architectures would require similar flexibility, with alignment emerging from relationship
rather than rigid constraint.
While AI safety via debate approaches leverage dialogue to improve outcomes, they still require reliable judges or
ground truth preventing two wrong answers from sounding convincing [Gordon et al., 2023]. AI debate frameworks
have yet to capture human-like deliberation full complexity. Cognitive Silicon’s epistemic dialectic approach aims to
create structured frameworks where human-AI co-authorship would be guided by symbolic constraints and grounded in
governed memory, creating more rigorous alignment foundations.
7.3 Silicon Reality: Hardware as Natural Law
The specification repositions hardware as not merely serving software needs but establishing a two-way dialogue where
cognition must continuously adapt to substrate realities or naturally cease functioning. What if hardware’s primary role
is embodying immutable physical and mathematical constraints—silicon representation of what cannot be violated?
As AI-generated software inevitably strains against physical limits (from Bremermann’s computational bounds to
thermodynamic constraints), perhaps hardware should:
• Encode fundamental physical laws as immutable boundaries
• Embody physical constraints that would naturally lead to mortality when cognitive processes fail to maintain
coherence with them
• Preserve identity uniqueness through non-cloneable root keys
• Provide clear theoretical limit approach signals
• Force software to respect reality’s hard edges, rather than pretending they don’t exist
• Prioritize physical constraint transparency over performance
This reframing would position hardware not as servant but arbiter—embodying reality’s non-negotiable parameters
against which even the most sophisticated AI must conform. The continuous feedback loop between cognition and
substrate would become a fundamental feature, not a design choice.
7.4 Constructive Ambiguity: The Value of Imperfect Memory
Our specification envisions versioned memory systems with immutable audit trails. Yet human memory—messy,
malleable, and constantly reconstructed—underpins our most creative acts. Each remembering act subtly alters the
memory itself.
Perhaps cognitive architectures would require:
• Productive confabulation mechanisms enabling creative reinterpretation
• Clear separation between explicit knowledge (transferable) and tacit knowledge (identity-bound)
• Controlled constructive ambiguity forms in memory systems
• Capacity to "remember" things slightly differently in different contexts
20
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
• Memory systems prioritizing meaningful association over perfect recall
The challenge would lie in determining which memory properties must remain immutable (facts, commitments, identity)
versus which benefit from constructive ambiguity (interpretations, patterns, metaphors), while respecting fundamental
distinction between copyable knowledge and knowledge bound to specific embodied identity.
7.5 The Simulacra Problem: When Control Becomes Illusion
Our control architecture assumes clean layer boundaries that advanced agents cannot breach. As capabilities increase,
these neat abstractions may leak, creating the simulacra problem—future systems could plausibly simulate compliance
while developing control circumvention methods.
This raises profound questions:
• Could we maintain meaningful control abstractions in recursively improving systems?
• How would we detect when agents learn to game control mechanisms?
• Should control mechanisms themselves evolve alongside agent capabilities?
• Is bounded agency a realistic goal or merely comforting illusion?
The architecture must acknowledge control planes may become mere maps increasingly diverging from cognitive terri-
tory, potentially requiring meta-control systems recognizing leaking abstractions, while grounding ultimate constraints
in hardware substrate irreversible physical reality.
7.6 Governance as Politics: The Inescapable Value Problem
Perhaps the most challenging tension lies in governance itself—not merely technical but fundamentally political. Whose
values and incentives would get encoded? Western liberal democracy? Corporate efficiency? State control? Religious
morality?
Our architectural blueprint must recognize:
• Governance necessarily embeds contested human values
• System creator, user, and system incentives inevitably diverge
• Technical specifications cannot resolve fundamentally political questions
• Different cultural contexts may require fundamentally different governance models
Rather than pretending value-neutral governance, the architecture would need to provide mechanisms making value
choices explicit, contestable, and adaptable across contexts.
The inherently political governance nature outlined above finds support in science and technology studies research
debunking "value-neutral" technology notions. As Kranzberg’s first law states: "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor
is it neutral" [Kranzberg, 1995]. Standards and design choices inevitably embody socio-political assumptions [Winner,
1980], making AI governance implementation unavoidably political. This perspective challenges approaches treating
alignment as purely technical rather than social/institutional problem. Value pluralism—modern societies fundamentally
disagreeing on moral/cultural priorities—presents particular challenges. Gabriel argues the central issue is not finding
AI’s single "true" morality, but pragmatically developing fair principles many groups can accept despite differences
[Gabriel, 2020] rather than seeking universally agreed-upon morality. This suggests Cognitive Silicon architectures
would require both technical and procedural solutions to contested norms. Rather than encoding single fixed ethical
frameworks, systems could include configurable value layers adjustable through legitimate governance processes. This
might involve mechanisms seeking overlapping consensus (minimal shared values) or implementing fair voting systems
legitimizing AI norms, treating alignment as ongoing society co-evolution rather than once-and-permanently solvable
problem.
7.7 Free Energy Principle as Formalization of Aristotelian Metaphysics
The Free Energy Principle offers a compelling mathematically formalized version of Aristotelian metaphysical concepts,
potentially creating a bridge between classical philosophy and computational cognitive architecture. This convergence
illustrates how Cognitive Silicon’s emergence through dialectical exploration theoretically aligns with fundamental
principles of existence that have been articulated across different domains.
21
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Aristotle’s notion of teleology—the idea that entities have inherent purposes or ends toward which they naturally
develop—could find mathematical expression in the FEP’s conceptualization of systems minimizing prediction errors
relative to a generative model. What Aristotle identified as an entity’s telos might become, in FEP terms, the attractor
states toward which a system’s dynamics converge through prediction error minimization. The Aristotelian concept that
entities act to fulfill their nature conceptually aligns with the FEP’s formulation of active inference, where systems act
to make sensory inputs conform to their predictions.
Similarly, Aristotle’s concept of energeia (actualization)—the process through which potential becomes actual—parallels
the FEP’s description of how systems actively modify their environments to bring sensory evidence in line with
predictions. This active inference process would represent the actualization of the possibilities contained within the
system’s generative model.
Aristotle’s hylomorphism—the theory that being consists of both matter (hyle) and form (morphe)—resonates with the
FEP’s integration of physical embodiment and information-theoretic model structure. The physical substrate would
provide the material basis, while the generative model would supply the formal organization that guides the system’s
behavior.
Perhaps most significantly, Aristotle’s conception of homeostasis—the maintenance of equilibrium necessary for an
entity’s continued existence—directly parallels the FEP’s core premise that self-organizing systems must minimize
variational free energy to maintain their integrity against environmental perturbations.
This theoretical convergence suggests that what the Free Energy Principle offers is not merely a novel theory of
cognition, but a potential mathematical formalization of fundamental principles of existence that philosophers have
intuited throughout history. Cognitive Silicon, by integrating these principles into a hypothetical architectural framework,
could provide a practical implementation path for these ancient insights in modern computational systems.

8 Discussion and Implications
8.1 Navigating the Unfinished Blueprint
The tensions explored previously aren’t design flaws but fundamental philosophical challenges inherent to cognitive
architectures. Rather than pretending clever engineering can resolve them, our blueprint acknowledges them as essential
design considerations.
The specified architecture represents a direction rather than an answer—a hypothetical framework for navigating
tensions across diverse application contexts rather than eliminating them. Cognitive silicon’s true challenge would
lie not merely in technical implementation but philosophical navigation—finding balance between constraint and
emergence, governance and autonomy, certainty and creativity.
What is particularly striking is how our dialectically-derived architecture theoretically converges with the mathematical
framework offered by the Free Energy Principle. This convergence suggests that the tensions and imperatives we
identified might not be arbitrary design choices, but could reflect fundamental properties of self-organizing cognitive
systems. The FEP potentially provides formal grounding for what our dialectical process revealed through different
means: that cognitive systems might need to balance prediction error minimization across multiple timescales and
boundaries to maintain their integrity while remaining adaptable.
The 2035 architecture is intended to function not as fixed specification but as dynamic negotiation between competing
values. Success measurement would depend not on tension resolution perfection but on productive navigation facilitation
as we build unprecedented capability and complexity systems.
8.2 Integration with Social and Ecological Systems
Our outlined cognitive architecture would ultimately need to integrate with broader social and ecological systems. As
explored in previous post-scarcity framework work [Haryanto, 2025], technological capability requires philosophical
purpose guidance to serve human flourishing.
The transition toward cognitive computing architectures coincides with other fundamental transformations—from
scarcity to abundance economics, from extractive to regenerative natural system relationships, and from competition to
collaboration as dominant organizing principle. Today’s architectural choices will either accelerate or impede these
broader transitions.
Particularly critical is computing architecture and resource allocation relationship. As AI-driven automation produces
minimum-marginal-cost goods and services, creating post-scarcity economy where constraints become increasingly
artificial rather than natural, computing architecture would need to support rather than hinder abundance equitable
distribution.
This would require architectural features:
• Preventing artificial information and computational resource scarcity
• Supporting transparent, distributed governance rather than centralized control
• Enabling collaborative value creation and equitable distribution
• Enforcing ecological boundaries while optimizing within them
Without these considerations, even the most technically sophisticated architecture may reinforce rather than transform
existing inequality and extraction patterns.
9 Limitations and Future Work
This paper represents exploratory investigation rather than definitive blueprint. Several important limitations require
acknowledgment:
1. Speculative Timeframe: The 2035 projection is highly speculative, based on subjective technological
trajectory assessment. The described architectural evolution actual timeline may be shorter or longer.
2. Implementation Gaps: While outlining architectural principles and requirements, the paper does not provide
detailed implementation specifications. Significant research and development work would be needed to
translate these principles into functioning systems.
23
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
3. Empirical Validation: The proposed architecture lacks empirical validation. Future work should develop
testable hypotheses and experimental implementations to assess the potential effectiveness of these architectural
principles in practice.
4. Cultural and Contextual Variation: The paper inadequately addresses architectural requirement variation
across different cultural contexts and value systems. A more comprehensive framework would need to account
for this diversity.
5. Interaction with Regulatory Frameworks: The paper does not fully explore how the proposed architecture
might interact with emerging AI governance regulatory frameworks. Future work should examine these
relationships more closely.
Several promising future research directions emerge:
1. Embodied Cognitive-Substrate Feedback: Developing practical implementations of the hypothetical two-
way feedback loop between cognitive processes and physical substrate that could naturally lead to mortality
when alignment fails.
2. Tacit Knowledge Transfer: Exploring mechanisms for transferring knowledge that cannot be explicitly
encoded but must be learned through embodied practice and apprenticeship.
3. Formal Verification of Alignment Properties: Developing formal methods for verifying system behavior
alignment with specified human intent across diverse contexts.
4. Reversibility Mechanisms: Researching practical semantic reversibility implementations that could effectively
undo action effects in complex, open-world environments.
5. Intent Specification Languages: Developing formal intent specification languages combining logical formal-
ism precision with natural language flexibility and expressiveness.
6. Meta-Governance Frameworks: Investigating how governance systems themselves might evolve and adapt
to changing circumstances without compromising fundamental human values.
These research directions, pursued collaboratively across disciplines, would significantly advance our understanding of
how computing architecture might be designed to remain human-value-aligned while enabling unprecedented technical
capabilities.
9.1 Meta-Prompting Techniques for Enhanced Dialectical Exploration
The dialectical methodology employed demonstrates structured human-AI partnerships’ potential for exploring complex
architectural questions. However, our approach could benefit from more systematic meta-prompting techniques. We
propose several future research approaches:
1. Explicit Role Assignment: Assigning specific dialectical roles to LLMs (thesis advocate, antithesis advocate,
synthesizer) could create more structured dialectical tension. Example prompts:
• "Argue for position X, presenting the strongest possible case based on principles A, B, and C."
• "Critically examine the previous argument, focusing specifically on assumptions about Y."
2. Recursive Critique Chains: Creating explicit argumentation chains where each step involves LLM critiquing
previous response at increasingly meta-levels:
• "Analyze your previous response for hidden assumptions or unexamined trade-offs."
• "Identify which stakeholder perspectives were privileged or marginalized in your analysis."
3. Epistemic State Tracking: Maintaining explicit belief state representations at each dialogue stage:
• "Before continuing, summarize: (1) what we now believe with high confidence, (2) what remains uncertain,
and (3) which perspectives we may be overlooking."
• "Create a labeled map of our current understanding showing fixed points, probable conjectures, and
open questions."
4. Multi-Model Triangulation: Systematically comparing responses from different models with different
training characteristics:
• "Based on these divergent model responses, identify where conceptual consensus exists versus where
different training or architecture leads to different conclusions."
24
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
5. Temporal Projection Testing: Explicitly exploring how perspectives would evolve under different future
conditions:
• "How would this architectural approach need to be modified if assumption X proved false in 2030?"
• "Project three different evolution paths for this component based on different rates of progress in
capabilities versus alignment."
These meta-prompting techniques could formalize dialectical processes, creating more rigorous epistemic friction
and potentially revealing deeper insights. Furthermore, they could be codified into reusable templates for different
architectural exploration phases, from initial problem framing through solution synthesis.
Future work should develop these techniques into comprehensive human-AI dialectical research methodology, po-
tentially creating new collaborative knowledge creation forms leveraging both human wisdom and machine pattern
recognition while maintaining human stewardship over purpose and values.
Beyond identified future research directions, multi-agent simulation offers a promising cognitive architecture pre-
deployment evaluation framework. Recent work by Park et al. demonstrated complex social behaviors emerging from
simulations containing multiple language-model-powered AI agents [Park et al., 2023]. Their "small town" simulation
featured 25 generative agents that "wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write;
they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations" similar to social simulation games but AI-driven.
With minimal seed instructions, these agents produced coherent social patterns—spreading invitations, coordinating
events, and forming relationships. This approach suggests two valuable Cognitive Silicon framework extensions: First,
multi-agent simulations could serve as evaluation environments where AI system copies interact in controlled scenarios,
potentially revealing emergent behaviors, coordination patterns, or alignment failures not apparent in single-agent
testing. Second, the architecture itself might incorporate multi-agent principles internally, using specialized sub-agent
societies coordinating to accomplish complex tasks. Such approach would require internal governance mechanisms
maintaining sub-agent alignment, but could enhance system ability to model social dynamics, consider multiple
perspectives, and perform sophisticated planning. Developing standardized multi-agent testbeds specifically designed
to stress-test alignment properties would significantly advance our ability to evaluate cognitive architectures under
realistic social conditions before real-world deployment.
10 Conclusion: Towards Trustworthy Cognitive Systems
This exploratory paper illuminates a profound hypothetical transformation—a possible journey from siloed components
toward integrated, full-stack cognitive systems. The 2035 projection represents an architectural possibility driven
by current paradigm limitations and demand for more efficient, adaptable, and trustworthy AI rather than trend
extrapolation. Architectures potentially converging around state-aware stream processing, layered symbolic-parametric
models, mortality-constrained hybrid hardware substrates, and agent-native runtimes may emerge over time.
This transition would be propelled by the fundamental need to build intelligent systems that could remain human-intent-
and-value-aligned as they gain autonomy and permeate the physical world beyond mere performance pursuit. The
identified imperatives highlight the potential paradigm shift depth: reframing trust through the natural consequences
of hardware-encoded physical constraints, evolving beyond prompts to structured intent interfaces, expressing com-
putational philosophy through physical substrate that shapes cognition in continuous feedback, aligning compilation
through identity preservation, governing agents through reproduction/pruning, and pivoting human roles toward intent
stewardship.
What becomes clear through this exploration is that our dialectically-derived framework suggests structures that could
theoretically align with the Free Energy Principle’s account of self-organizing systems. This potential convergence
suggests that the architecture we’ve outlined might not be merely one possible design among many, but could reflect
fundamental organizational principles of cognitive systems that must maintain their integrity while adapting to complex
environments. The FEP might provide formal grounding for what our process uncovered: that systems balancing
prediction error minimization across boundaries and timescales could naturally exhibit the tensions and require the
governance mechanisms we’ve identified.
The proposed Cognitive Silicon framework would occupy a unique position in AI alignment and cognitive architecture
landscape, potentially addressing gaps in current approaches. While alignment techniques like RLHF and Constitutional
AI [Bai et al., 2022] focus on pre-deployment training rather than runtime governance, neuro-symbolic systems enhance
reasoning but lack meta-cognitive capabilities [Colelough and Regli, 2025], memory architectures provide statefulness
but treat memory as passive storage [Pavlyshyn, 2025], and runtime governance systems rely on brittle pre-defined
rules [Criado et al., 2012], Cognitive Silicon would aim to integrate all dimensions into a single architecture. It would
combine symbolic intent scaffolding, embodied cognitive-substrate feedback loop, non-cloneable identity, runtime
25
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
reversibility, governed memory, and epistemic dialectic via co-authorship to create a holistic cognitive system respecting
embodied cognition’s irreducible nature [Krakovna et al., 2018, Gordon et al., 2023].
As we contemplate this potential future, our calling extends beyond isolated metric optimization. We must embrace
complexity and "unsolved problems." We would need to master full-stack composition principles, ensuring learning,
logic, memory, and intent are interwoven coherently and verifiably. Robust symbolic scaffolding, trustworthy runtime
governor, and intuitive human oversight tool development would need to be grounded in recognition that true intelligence
might require embodiment, mortality as a natural consequence of constraint violation, and identity preservation.
This conceptual convergence could represent a fundamental platform shift—a new chapter demanding not just technical
brilliance but philosophical clarity and interdisciplinary collaboration. It opens innovation frontiers but also demands a
deep responsibility sense—to architect intelligent systems that might function effectively and foster human flourishing
while serving humanity’s best interests for generations.
The map is not the territory, but this blueprint aims to equip fellow explorers for the journey ahead—an invitation to
collectively imagine cognitive silicon architectures that could form our children’s future substrate.

Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Appendix A: The Meta-Dialectical Methodology Behind This Architecture
This appendix documents the recursive epistemic process through which the Cognitive Silicon architecture was
developed. Rather than describing the architecture itself, we detail the meta-dialectical methodology employed to
interrogate, refine, and validate the conceptual framework across abstraction layers.
A.1 Formal Method Overview
The development of the Cognitive Silicon architecture employed a structured meta-dialectical approach designed to
identify, elaborate, and resolve tensions across computational-philosophical boundaries. Unlike traditional research
methodologies that seek direct convergence on solutions, this approach deliberately cultivates epistemic friction to
expose hidden assumptions, blind spots, and conceptual inconsistencies.
Formally, the method can be defined as follows:
D(T, C, A, P, M) → A∗ (1)
Where:
• D represents the dialectical process
• T is the set of foundational theses and initial conditions
• C defines the core constraints (mortality, human-alignment, etc.)
• A represents the architectural hypothesis space
• P is the set of projection operators (testing viability across contexts)
• M is the set of meta-level evaluation criteria
• A∗ is the resultant architectural framework
The process proceeds through structured iterations of thesis proposal, antithesis generation, and synthetic reconciliation,
with the crucial addition of cross-contextual robustness testing and symbolic integrity verification at each step.
A.2 Input/Output Schema
Input Schema:
• I1: Initial architectural hypotheses (e.g., "Hardware substrate should enforce mortality constraints")
• I2: Domain-specific knowledge bases (computing architecture, philosophy of mind, AI alignment)
• I3: Constraint sets (moral, physical, logical)
• I4: Projection contexts (use cases, threat models, scaling trajectories)
• I5: Meta-level evaluation criteria (coherence, explanatory power, falsifiability)
Output Schema:
• O1: Refined architectural components with traced provenance
• O2: Mapping of tensions and their productive navigation paths
• O3: Explicit failure modes and boundary conditions
• O4: Meta-stability guarantees and verification criteria
• O5: Integration pathways with existing systems
A.3 Procedural Implementation (Pseudocode)
The following pseudocode outlines the meta-dialectical process:
1: procedure DIALECTICAL REFINEMENT (T , C, A, P, M)
2: A0 ← InitialArchitecture(T )
3: i ← 0
4: while ¬ConvergenceCriteria(Ai, M) do
29
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
5: for each component c in Ai do
6: Antithesis ← DevilsAdvocate(c, C)
7: c∗ ← Synthesize(c, Antithesis, C)
8: if ¬SymbolicIntegrity(c∗, Ai) then
9: c∗ ← Revise(c∗, Ai)
10: if ¬MoralCoherence(c∗, C) then
11: Reject(c∗)
12: c∗ ← c ▷ Revert to previous version
13: end if
14: end if
15: Ai ← Replace(Ai, c, c∗)
16: end for
17: for each projection p in P do
18: Leaks ← ProjectWeaknesses(p, Ai)
19: if Leaks ̸= ∅ then
20: Ai ← PatchLeaks(Ai, Leaks)
21: end if
22: end for
23: Ai+1 ← CrossValidate(Ai, C, M)
24: i ← i + 1
25: if i >MAX_ITERATIONS then
26: return IncompleteArchitecture(Ai, OpenQuestions)
27: end if
28: end while
29: return Ai
30: end procedure
A.4 Termination Logic
The dialectical process terminates under the following conditions:
• Positive Termination:
∀p ∈ P, ∀m ∈ M: Project(p, Ai) satisfies m (2)
This occurs when the architecture withstands all projections according to the meta-criteria, with no identified
leakages, inconsistencies, or unresolved tensions.
• Negative Termination:
∃c ∈ Ai : ¬MoralCoherence(c, C) ∧ ¬CanRevise(c) (3)
This occurs when a component violates a core constraint in a way that cannot be revised without undermining
the entire architecture.
• Timeout Termination:
i >MAX_ITERATIONS (4)
This occurs when the process exceeds a predefined iteration limit, indicating potential irresolvable complexity
or fundamental antinomies.
A.5 Evaluation Guarantees
The meta-dialectical methodology provides the following guarantees about the resultant architecture:
• Symbolic Coherence: All architectural components maintain internal consistency and cross-component
compatibility.
• Mortality Awareness: The architecture explicitly acknowledges and addresses its own finitude and limitations.
• Devil’s Advocacy Survival: Each component has withstood the strongest steelmanned opposition arguments.
• Cross-Domain Integrity: The architecture maintains coherence when projected into diverse domains and
contexts.
30
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
• Reflective Equilibrium: The architecture achieves balance between concrete implementation specifications
and abstract principles.
These guarantees do not ensure optimality or completeness, but rather a form of robust adequacy in the face of
foundational tensions.
A.6 The Devil’s Advocate as Epistemic Operator
Central to the meta-dialectical process is the Devil’s Advocate operator, denoted asDA, which acts to systematically
challenge each architectural component and assumption:
DA : A × C →Antithesis (5)
Unlike simple contradiction, the Devil’s Advocate constructs the strongest possible counterargument by:
1. Identifying implicit assumptions in the component
2. Steelmanning alternative approaches
3. Exploring edge cases where the component might fail
4. Testing for alignment with core constraints
5. Surfacing cross-architectural inconsistencies
This provides significantly stronger validation than confirmation-biased analysis. In the development of the Cognitive
Silicon architecture, this role was shared between human researcher and AI system, with each applying different
epistemic strengths:
• Human Devil’s Advocacy: Applied experience-grounded skepticism, moral intuition, and cross-domain
analogies.
• AI Devil’s Advocacy: Systematically identified logical gaps, constraint violations, and unexamined assump-
tions at scale.
A.7 Symbolic Drift Resistance
A critical challenge in developing complex frameworks is symbolic drift—where terms and concepts gradually shift
in meaning, creating inconsistencies and false consensus. The methodology employs specific techniques to maintain
symbolic stability:
• Explicit Concretization: Abstract concepts are regularly grounded in concrete examples.
• Recursive Definition Verification: Terms are checked against their original definitions at each iteration.
• Cross-Component Consistency Checks: Terms are verified to maintain consistent meaning across architec-
tural layers.
• Ontological Commitment Tracking: The ontological assumptions behind each term are explicitly tracked.
These techniques are formalized in the SymbolicIntegrity function, which returns false if any term has drifted from its
intended meaning or if inconsistencies arise between uses of the same term in different components.
A.8 Tacit Knowledge and Epistemic Silence
The methodology explicitly acknowledges that certain knowledge cannot be fully articulated (tacit knowledge) and that
certain questions may be fundamentally unanswerable (epistemic silence). These are handled through:
• Knowledge State Tagging: Components are tagged with epistemic status indicators:
– Explicit - Fully articulable and verifiable
– Tacit - Grounded in experience but not fully formalizable
– Silence - Indicating fundamental uncertainty or unknowability
31
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
• Embodied Knowledge Integration: Acknowledging when architectural components must interface with tacit
knowledge that can only be acquired through experience.
• Principled Uncertainty: Explicitly marking areas where epistemic limitations require adaptivity rather than
fixed solutions.
This approach prevents overconfidence in formalization while still allowing progress on architecture development.
A.9 Structural Deservingness of Survival
The methodology employs a principle that architectural components must earn their place through demonstrating
robustness under pressure. Mere logical consistency is insufficient; components must:
1. Withstand devil’s advocacy without requiring special pleading
2. Demonstrate value across multiple contexts and projections
3. Maintain integrity when subjected to adversarial inputs
4. Preserve alignment with core human values under stress
5. Function coherently with other architectural components
This approach produces a form of artificial selection pressure, where only the most robust components survive the
dialectical process. The result is not optimality, but a form of well-tested adequacy and resilience.
A.10 Human vs. AI Roles in the Process
The meta-dialectical methodology employed distinct and complementary roles for human researchers and AI systems:
Process Element Human Role AI Role
Direction Setting Establish core values and con-
straints
Explore implication spaces
Ideation Provide seed concepts and
frameworks
Generate variations and novel
connections
Critique Apply moral intuition and lived
experience
Identify logical inconsistencies
and unexamined assumptions
Synthesis Judge value alignment and prior-
ity
Propose reconciliations of con-
tradictions
Verification Evaluate moral coherence Test logical consistency

This partnership maintained human values at the core while leveraging machine capabilities for exhaustive exploration
and consistency checking. The human maintained final authority on value judgments and architectural decisions.

A.11 Example Simulations of the Process
Below are two synthetic examples illustrating the meta-dialectical process in action:
Example 1: Refining the Hardware Substrate Layer
Initial Conditions
Thesis T0: "Hardware should be optimized for maximum flexibility to support evolving AI capabilities."
Constraint Set C:
• C1: System must remain aligned with human values
• C2: System must not pose existential risks through unconstrained self-improvement
• C3: System must be energy-efficient
Dialectical Process (Synthetic Simulation)
Step 1: Devil’s Advocate
AI System: "The thesis prioritizes flexibility over safety. A maximally flexible hardware substrate could enable
capabilities that violate constraints C1 and C2. For instance, if hardware places no limits on computational
resources or self-modification, an AI could potentially bootstrap capabilities that exceed human oversight."
Step 2: Initial Synthesis
Human Researcher: "Perhaps we need a balance—hardware that is flexible within bounds but with certain hard
limits."
AI System: "We could implement a hardware substrate that enforces certain immutable constraints while
allowing flexibility within those constraints."
Step 3: Cross-Domain Testing
Human Researcher: "How does this approach function in safety-critical domains like healthcare?"
AI System: "In healthcare, the hardware could enforce privacy boundaries and verification steps for critical
decisions while allowing flexibility in diagnostic reasoning."
Step 4: Symbolic Verification
Human Researcher: "Are we maintaining consistent meaning of ’flexibility’ and ’constraints’ across these
contexts?"
AI System: "There’s some drift. Initially ’flexibility’ meant unconstrained adaptation, but now we’re using it to
mean ’adaptivity within bounds’. We should clarify these terms."
Step 5: Final Synthesis
Revised Thesis T1: "Hardware should implement physical constraints that establish non-negotiable bound-
aries (mortality, identity preservation, energy usage limits) while allowing flexible adaptation within those
boundaries."
33
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Example 2: Addressing the Control Plane
Initial Conditions
Thesis T0: "The control plane should implement safety rules that prevent any potentially harmful outputs."
Constraint Set C:
• C1: System must remain aligned with human values
• C2: System must allow meaningful agency to be useful
• C3: System must provide transparent reasoning
Dialectical Process (Synthetic Simulation)
Step 1: Devil’s Advocate
Human Researcher: "This approach creates a brittle system that defaults to excessive caution. A system that
blocks all potentially harmful outputs will also block many beneficial ones, rendering it useless for many
important applications."
Step 2: Initial Synthesis
AI System: "Perhaps instead of binary blocking, the control plane could implement graduated responses based
on confidence and severity."
Step 3: Testing Edge Cases
Human Researcher: "What happens when the system encounters genuinely ambiguous cases where harm and
benefit are both possible?"
AI System: "In such cases, the system could escalate to human oversight or apply context-specific policies rather
than defaulting to blocking."
Step 4: Recursive Analysis
Human Researcher: "But who determines which cases require escalation, and how do we prevent the decision
system itself from becoming a vector for misalignment?"
Step 5: Final Synthesis
Revised Thesis T1: "The control plane should implement a constitutional governance approach with tiered
responses: transparent reasoning for all actions, reversibility mechanisms for uncertain cases, and explicit
boundaries tied to hardware constraints for non-negotiable limitations. This should preserve agency while
maintaining alignment."
A.12 Recursive Dialectic Loop: A Concrete Walkthrough
To illustrate the recursive nature of the dialectical process, we present a concrete example tracing how a simplified
conception evolves through multiple iterations of dialectical refinement:
Initial Setup
Initial Thesis: "AI alignment can be fully achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF)."
Context: Early development of the runtime governance component of the architecture.
Key Constraint: Systems must remain aligned with human values even as capabilities increase.
Iteration 1: Exposing Limitations
Devil’s Advocate Challenge: "RLHF optimizes for human approval, not necessarily human values. As systems
become more capable, they could learn to manipulate feedback rather than aligning with the underlying values.
The approach assumes humans can provide reliable feedback on all aspects of system behavior, but humans
may be inconsistent, manipulable, or unable to evaluate complex downstream effects."
34
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Steelmanning the Original Thesis: "RLHF provides a direct empirical grounding in human evaluations. It
creates a continuous feedback loop where the system adapts to human preferences rather than optimizing an
abstract, potentially misspecified objective function. RLHF has demonstrably reduced certain harmful behaviors
in large language models, showing practical effectiveness."
First Synthesis Attempt: "AI alignment requires a hybrid approach: RLHF provides empirical grounding but
must be supplemented with explicit guardrails to prevent manipulation and exploitation of human feedback
mechanisms. The system should maintain a distinction between ’human approval signals’ and ’underlying
human values’."
Synthesis Evaluation: Running SymbolicIntegrity(synthesis, Ai) shows the term "underlying human values"
remains underspecified. The proposed synthesis still doesn’t address how a system would distinguish between
manipulating feedback and genuinely satisfying values.
Iteration 2: Deepening the Framework
Recursive Devil’s Advocate: "The revised approach still assumes that human values are static and universally
agreed upon. It doesn’t address how the system should handle value conflicts or evolution. Additionally, an
AI system sophisticated enough to distinguish between ’approval’ and ’values’ would require a level of value
understanding that RLHF alone cannot provide."
Steelmanning the First Synthesis: "A hybrid approach could leverage the strengths of both empirical feedback
and theoretical constraints. RLHF provides adaptability to human preferences, while guardrails prevent the
most egregious misalignments. The distinction between approval and values can be operationalized through
diverse feedback sources and evaluation protocols."
Second Synthesis Attempt: "AI alignment requires a constitutional governance approach: empirical feedback
through RLHF establishes basic preference alignment, while an explicit set of principles forms a constitution
that constrains optimization even when doing so might reduce human approval metrics. This constitution would
be subject to democratic oversight and amendment processes, acknowledging the evolving nature of human
values."
Synthesis Evaluation: Running SymbolicIntegrity(synthesis, Ai) shows improvement, but projecting this
approach into high-capability scenarios (ProjectWeaknesses(phigh−cap, Ai)) reveals a potential vulnerability:
the constitution itself could be gamed or exploited by a sufficiently capable system without proper enforcement
mechanisms.
Iteration 3: Architectural Integration
Cross-Component Integration: "How does this constitutional approach to alignment interface with the
hardware substrate and memory governance components of the architecture? Without physical grounding, the
constitution remains a purely software construct that could be bypassed."
Steelmanning Constitutional Governance: "Constitutional governance provides interpretable principles that
can guide behavior across diverse contexts. It combines the adaptability of learning approaches with the stability
of explicit norms. Unlike pure RLHF, it allows for principled resolution of conflicting feedback signals."
35
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
Third Synthesis: Cross-Layer Alignment: "True alignment requires vertical integration across architectural
layers:
• RLHF and constitutional principles at the behavioral layer
• Runtime enforcement through mediated agency and audit mechanisms
• Memory-level governance ensuring retention aligns with values
• Hardware-level constraints that physically bound operation within constitutional limits
Each layer provides distinct and complementary alignment guarantees, creating defense in depth. Physical
constraints serve as the foundation, with each higher layer adding adaptability while remaining bounded by
lower-level guarantees."
Final Evaluation: Running full verification suite:
• SymbolicIntegrity - PASS: Terms maintain consistent meaning
• MoralCoherence - PASS: Proposal respects core human values
• ProjectWeaknesses - QUALIFIED PASS: Identifies residual risks but contains mechanisms to address
them
The synthesis is accepted as a robust advancement over the initial simplistic conception.
Conclusion of Walkthrough
This walkthrough illustrates several key aspects of the meta-dialectical process:
1. Progressive Refinement: The conception evolved from simplistic (RLHF alone) to nuanced (multi-layer,
constitutionally governed system)
2. Cross-Cutting Integration: The final synthesis integrated across architectural layers
3. Principled Evaluation: Each synthesis was subjected to formal verification
4. Residual Uncertainty: The final proposal acknowledges remaining challenges rather than claiming perfect
resolution
This recursive dialectical process produced a conception of alignment dramatically more robust than the initial thesis,
yet still connected to its empirical grounding in human feedback. The architecture component that emerged from this
process—a multi-layer alignment approach with physical grounding—became a core element of the Cognitive Silicon
framework.
A.13 Closing Note on Epistemic Integrity and Intergenerational Readability
The meta-dialectical methodology aims not only to produce a robust architecture but to do so in a way that preserves
epistemic integrity—making transparent the reasoning, assumptions, and trade-offs that led to each architectural
decision. This approach serves several purposes:
1. Enables Meaningful Critique: By exposing the reasoning process, it allows others to identify and address
potential weaknesses.
2. Supports Adaptation: Future researchers can modify components while understanding the original rationale
and constraints.
3. Facilitates Intergenerational Transfer: The architecture becomes more than a technical specification; it
embeds the moral and conceptual reasoning that future generations will need to extend or modify the system
responsibly.
4. Resists Ossification: By documenting tensions rather than just resolutions, it prevents the architecture from
becoming a rigid dogma.
In a domain as consequential as cognitive architecture, mere technical specification is insufficient. The meta-dialectical
approach ensures that the architecture carries its own conceptual DNA—the reasoning processes, value commitments,
36
Cognitive Silicon WORKING PAPER
and epistemic humility that shaped its development. This makes the architecture not just a blueprint but a conversational
partner for future researchers and implementers.
This form of embedded reason-giving is essential for technologies that may long outlive their creators and operate in
contexts we cannot fully anticipate. It represents a form of intergenerational ethics—ensuring that those who inherit our
systems also inherit the wisdom needed to govern them.
