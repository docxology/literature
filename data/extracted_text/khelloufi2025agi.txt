Abstract—The integration of the Internet of Everything (IoX)
and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has given rise to a
transformative paradigm aimed at addressing critical bottle-
necks across sensing, network, and application layers in Cyber-
Physical-Social Thinking (CPST) ecosystems. In this survey, we
provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AGI-enhanced
IoX research, focusing on three key components: sensing-layer
data management, network-layer protocol optimization, and
application-layer decision-making frameworks. Specifically, this
survey explores how AGI can mitigate IoX bottlenecks chal-
lenges by leveraging adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing,
and selective attention mechanisms at the sensing layer, while
resolving network-layer issues such as protocol heterogeneity
and dynamic spectrum management, neuro-symbolic reasoning,
active inference, and causal reasoning, Furthermore, the survey
examines AGI-enabled frameworks for managing identity and
relationship explosion. Key findings suggest that AGI-driven
strategies, such as adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing,
and semantic modeling, offer novel solutions to sensing-layer data
overload, network-layer protocol heterogeneity, and application-
layer identity explosion. The survey underscores the importance
of cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and
ethical governance frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX
systems. Finally, the survey identifies unresolved challenges,
such as computational requirements, scalability, and real-world
validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI’s
potential in addressing IoX bottlenecks. we believe AGI-enhanced
IoX is emerging as a critical research field at the intersection of
interconnected systems and advanced AI.

HE Internet of Everything (IoX) is a revolutionary con-
cept that builds on and extends the foundational princi-
ples of the Internet of Things (IoT)[1]. While IoT primarily
involves the connection of physical devices, machines, and
sensors to the internet, facilitating the exchange of data
and enabling automation, IoX takes this interconnection to a
new level by incorporating a broader spectrum of entities[2].
In addition to connecting physical objects and digital sys-
tems, IoX integrates social and cognitive dimensions into the
network, creating a more dynamic, adaptive, and context-
aware ecosystem. This expanded vision allows for interactions
not just between devices, but also between humans, social
groups, and intelligent systems, all working together to create

smarter environments and more efficient processes[3]. While
IoT has already transformed various sectors by enabling the
remote monitoring, control, and optimization of physical ob-
jects—from smart thermostats and wearable health devices to
industrial sensors and autonomous vehicles, it is inherently
limited to the physical and digital realms. In contrast, IoX
goes much further by introducing social and cognitive layers of
interaction. The social dimension encompasses the behaviors,
preferences, and decisions of individuals, communities, and
organizations, enabling systems to respond intelligently to
human actions and societal trends[4]. IoX comprises three
core components—Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of People
(IoP), and Internet of Thinking (IoTk)—to form dynamic,
context-aware ecosystems within the Cyber-Physical-Social-
Thinking (CPST) hyperspace. IoT handles physical interac-
tions, collecting and processing data from devices. IoP focuses
on social interactions, capturing behaviors, preferences, and
decisions of individuals and communities to enable socially
responsive systems[2]. For example, IoP allows smart cities to
adapt services like public transportation based on community
needs or social trends. IoTk introduces cognitive capabilities,
enabling systems to emulate human-like thinking, learning,
and decision-making, such as incorporating mental well-being
data in healthcare applications. This multidimensional inte-
gration of physical (IoT), social (IoP), and cognitive (IoTk)
elements, alongside digital systems (cyber), distinguishes IoX
from IoT, fostering intelligent environments in domains like
smart cities and healthcare.
The evolution of the Internet of People (IoP) emphasizes the
integration of human and social interactions into IoT frame-
works, forming a critical foundation for the social dimension
of Cyber-Physical-Social-Thinking (CPST) ecosystems in IoX
[5, 6]. IoP shifts the IoX paradigm toward a human-centric
ecosystem where devices, with smartphones as central hubs,
proactively manage user interactions based on sociological
profiles and context-aware reasoning. IoP leverages AGI to
process multimodal data—such as location, activity, and social
cues—enabling personalized, privacy-preserving interactions
and human-like social dynamics[7]. In contrast, the Internet
of Thinking (IoK) focuses on the creation, management,
and dissemination of collective knowledge across distributed
nodes, utilizing AGI for knowledge discovery, semantic in-
tegration, and collaborative intelligence. Together, IoP and
IoK enhance the social and cognitive dimensions of CPST
ecosystems, complementing IoT’s physical layer focus[6, 8, 9].
The CPST framework underpins IoX by integrating cyber
(digital infrastructure), physical (devices), social (human inter-
actions via IoP), and thinking (cognitive processes via IoTk)
PREPRINT ARXIV 2
spaces, creating interconnected ecosystems that respond to
diverse inputs[10]. The cognitive dimension focuses on the
ability of both humans and machines to make decisions, learn
from experience, and adapt to changing conditions in real
time. IoX is not merely about automating processes but also
about creating environments that understand, respond to, and
optimize interactions across diverse systems, physical, digital,
social, and cognitive.
This integration of multiple dimensions allows IoX systems
to be much more flexible and intelligent than traditional IoT
solutions[11, 12]. For example, IoX could enable a smart city
that not only manages traffic flow and energy usage but also
adapts its services based on social behaviors, individual pref-
erences, and cognitive inputs from its inhabitants. Similarly,
in healthcare, IoX could enable personalized treatments by
considering not just patient data from sensors but also social
factors like lifestyle choices, community health trends, and
cognitive factors such as mental well-being. The integration of
social, cognitive, and physical dimensions in IoX sets the stage
for the application of advanced AI systems, particularly Artifi-
cial General Intelligence (AGI), which enables more adaptive
and intelligent decision-making across these interconnected
layers[13].
A comprehensive understanding of cyberspace, as a do-
main encompassing cyber-enabled interactions, is essential
for conceptualizing the CPST hyperspace in IoX [14]. These
theoretical frameworks establish the basis for integrating phys-
ical, digital, and cognitive elements, necessitating the devel-
opment of advanced AGI methodologies. As IoT transitions
into the broader Internet of Everything (IoX), it introduces
complex challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and
cross-domain integration, which traditional IoT paradigms
struggle to address [15]. AGI’s cross-domain reasoning and
autonomous adaptation capabilities are pivotal in overcoming
these challenges and enabling more adaptive, resilient IoX
systems. A comprehensive review of cyberspace and CPST
interactions further reinforces the multidimensional nature of
IoX, where cyber, physical, social, and thinking elements con-
verge to form intelligent, interconnected ecosystems [16]. This
aligns closely with the concepts of AGI as a transformative en-
abler for CPST environments. Moreover, the vision of a smart
world—characterized by interconnected intelligent systems in
applications such as smart cities and healthcare—highlights
the real-world potential of IoX [16]. In this context, AGI
plays a critical role in overcoming layer-specific bottlenecks
and facilitating seamless, efficient integration across diverse
domains.
The distinctions between AI, Narrow AI, AGI, and Artifi-
cial Superintelligence (ASI) are fundamental to understanding
the evolution of intelligent systems[17]. AI encompasses a
broad spectrum of technologies designed to perform tasks
that typically require human intelligence, ranging from basic
automation to complex decision-making. Narrow AI, or also
known as weak AI, refers to specialized systems that excel
in specific tasks, such as image recognition or language
processing, but lack the ability to generalize beyond their pre-
defined functions [18]. In contrast, AGI represents a significant
advancement in AI, characterized by its ability to perform
a wide range of cognitive tasks at a human-like level[19].
Unlike Narrow AI, AGI can learn, adapt, and apply knowledge
across different domains beyond task-specific programming,
enabling more flexible and autonomous decision-making. As
such, AGI is considered a crucial milestone in AI research,
With the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by enabling
more generalized and adaptive intelligence. Beyond AGI, ASI
refers to an intelligence surpassing human capabilities in all
cognitive aspects, including creativity, reasoning, and problem-
solving[20]. While ASI remains theoretical, AGI is an active
area of research, driving advancements toward creating ma-
chines with human-like cognitive flexibility. Given its transfor-
mative potential, AGI serves as the primary focus of this study,
exploring its architectural frameworks, integration challenges,
and implications for intelligent systems. Figure 1 depicts the
hierarchical relationship among Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Narrow AI, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial
Superintelligence (ASI), highlighting how each category is
encompassed within the broader AI landscape.
Challenges in IoX within CPST The realization of IoX
in Cyber-Physical-Social-Thinking (CPST) ecosystems intro-
duces significant challenges across its layered architecture,
which this survey aims to address through AGI-enabled
solutions. These challenges, summarized below, arise from
integrating IoT, IoP, and IoTk within IoX’s complex, multi-
dimensional framework:
• General Challenges: Scalability, interoperability, and
cross-domain integration, driven by the growing number
of IoT devices, IoP social systems, and IoTk cognitive
processes, necessitating seamless interactions.
• Sensing Layer Challenges: Data overload and noise from
diverse sources, including IoT sensors, IoP social data
(e.g., user preferences), and IoTk cognitive inputs (e.g.,
mental state data), complicating real-time processing and
context-aware decision-making.
• Network Layer Challenges: Scalability, protocol hetero-
geneity, and bandwidth allocation in heterogeneous envi-
ronments, exacerbated by IoP’s high-volume social data
streams and IoTk’s compute-intensive cognitive process-
ing.
• Application Layer Challenges: Intelligent decision-
making under uncertainty, adapting to dynamic environ-
ments, and ensuring security and privacy, particularly for
IoP’s socially sensitive data and IoTk’s cognitive models.
• Multidimensional Integration Challenges: Seamlessly in-
tegrating physical (IoT), digital (cyber), social (IoP), and
cognitive (IoTk) dimensions to create cohesive ecosys-
tems.
• Real-World Application Challenges: Adapting to domains
like smart cities and healthcare, incorporating IoP-driven
social behaviors and IoTk-driven cognitive inputs.
These challenges represent critical bottlenecks that hinder
IoX’s potential in CPST ecosystems. This survey focuses on
leveraging AGI to mitigate these issues across IoX’s sensing,
network, and application layers, as illustrated in Figure 2,
which aligns bottlenecks with the CPST model.
The integration of physical, digital, social, and cognitive
PREPRINT ARXIV 3
Fig. 1. The Hierarchical Relationship of AI, AGI, and ASI
dimensions in IoX introduces significant challenges across its
layered architecture. At the sensing layer, the sheer volume
of data generated by interconnected devices often leads to
data overload and noise, complicating real-time processing
and context-aware decision-making. The network layer strug-
gles with scalability, interoperability, and efficient bandwidth
allocation, particularly in heterogeneous environments where
devices and protocols must seamlessly interact. Meanwhile,
the application layer faces challenges in intelligent decision-
making under uncertainty, as well as adapting to dynamic
and evolving environments while ensuring robust security and
privacy[21].
These challenges underscore the need to understand the
evolutionary context of IoX and its expanded scope beyond
traditional IoT frameworks. The evolution of the Internet of
People (IoP) emphasizes the integration of human and social
interactions into IoT frameworks, forming a critical foundation
for the social dimension of Cyber-Physical-Social-Thinking
(CPST) ecosystems in IoX [5]. This perspective highlights
the need for intelligent systems that adapt to dynamic social
behaviors, setting the stage for AGI-driven solutions to address
key IoX bottlenecks.
A comprehensive understanding of cyberspace, as a do-
main encompassing cyber-enabled interactions, is essential
for conceptualizing the CPST hyperspace in IoX [14]. These
theoretical frameworks establish the basis for integrating phys-
ical, digital, and cognitive elements, necessitating the devel-
opment of advanced AGI methodologies. As IoT transitions
into the broader Internet of Everything (IoX), it introduces
complex challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and
cross-domain integration, which traditional IoT paradigms
struggle to address [15]. AGI’s cross-domain reasoning and
autonomous adaptation capabilities are pivotal in overcoming
these challenges and enabling more adaptive, resilient IoX
systems. A comprehensive review of cyberspace and CPST
interactions further reinforces the multidimensional nature of
IoX, where cyber, physical, social, and thinking elements con-
verge to form intelligent, interconnected ecosystems [16]. This
aligns closely with the concepts of AGI as a transformative en-
abler for CPST environments. Moreover, the vision of a smart
world—characterized by interconnected intelligent systems in
applications such as smart cities and healthcare—highlights
the real-world potential of IoX [16]. In this context, AGI
plays a critical role in overcoming layer-specific bottlenecks
and facilitating seamless, efficient integration across diverse
domains.
These bottlenecks highlight the limitations of traditional
approaches, such as Narrow AI and rule-based systems, which
often lack the flexibility and adaptability required for IoX’s
complex, multi-dimensional ecosystems. AGI, with its abil-
ity to generalize knowledge across domains, adapt dynam-
ically, and perform cross-domain reasoning, emerges as a
transformative solution. For instance, AGI can enable real-
time data fusion and noise reduction in sensor networks,
self-organizing and scalable communication protocols, and
intelligent, context-aware decision-making that evolves with
changing conditions. By addressing these challenges, AGI has
the potential to unlock the full potential of IoX in Cyber-
Physical-Social-Thinking (CPST) spaces, enabling smarter,
more adaptive, and resilient systems. This survey systemat-
ically examines AGI-enabled solutions for overcoming bottle-
necks across IoX layers in CPST ecosystems. Our primary
focus is on:
• Architectural Frameworks: How AGI can be integrated
into sensing, network, and application layers to enhance
performance and adaptability.
• Integration Challenges: Technical, operational, and scal-
ability barriers in deploying AGI-driven solutions.
• Practical Applications: Real-world use cases of AGI
in IoX, such as smart cities, healthcare, and industrial
automation.
Figure 2 provides a visual representation of the fundamental
bottlenecks in IoX systems, aligned with the CPST (Cyber-
Physical-Social-Thinking) model, which organizes the IoX
PREPRINT ARXIV 4
system into four key spaces: Cyber, Physical, Social, and
Thinking[22]. The IoX system is composed of three critical
layers: the Sensing Layer, which is responsible for collecting
raw data from the physical world through various sensors;
the Network Layer, which facilitates communication and data
transmission between IoX devices and systems; and the Ap-
plication Layer, where data is processed and transformed into
meaningful insights to serve diverse user needs. However, as
the number of devices and applications in the IoX ecosystem
continues to grow, significant bottlenecks have emerged[23],
limiting the performance and scalability of these systems.
These challenges include limited sensing resources [24], which
hinder the ability to accurately and comprehensively monitor
the environment; limited communication resources[25], which
result in congestion, data loss, and latency, affecting real-
time performance; personalized user requirements[26], which
demand highly customizable and context-sensitive services tai-
lored to individual preferences and needs; and computational
constraints, which limit the processing power available for
handling the vast amounts of data generated by IoX systems,
restricting the implementation of advanced algorithms, AI
models, and real-time decision-making processes[27].
Effective task allocation among connected devices is critical
for addressing computational and energy constraints in IoX,
particularly at the sensing and application layers [28]. These
challenges highlight the limitations of traditional approaches
while underscoring the potential of AGI to optimize resource
distribution. The explosive growth of applications, devices, and
data links in the IoX ecosystem—emphasized in the figure 2
further exacerbates these bottlenecks, making their resolution
essential for enhancing system-wide efficiency, adaptability,
and sustainability. Ultimately, overcoming these hurdles is
pivotal to unlocking IoX’s full potential, where AGI-driven
strategies can enable seamless coordination and resilient op-
eration across increasingly complex networks.
While we acknowledge the ethical and societal implications
of AGI in IoX, such as privacy concerns and bias in decision-
making, these topics are secondary to our technical focus. We
below highlight the key contributions of the survey, reflecting
its comprehensive approach to advancing the understanding
and application of AGI in IoX within CPST ecosystems:

challenges in IoX across sensing, network, and applica-

orous methodology to synthesize existing research, com-
paring AGI with Narrow AI and identifying gaps, with a

technical, operational, and scalability challenges, provid-
ing a foundation for future implementations.

for future work, including AGI standardization, quantum
communication, and application-specific innovations, fos-
tering interdisciplinary collaboration.
The rest of this survey is organized as follows:

tions to IoX bottlenecks across sensing, network, and applica-
tion layers. Sections 3 describe the methodology for identify-
ing and analyzing AGI-enhanced solutions to IoX bottlenecks,

tems, focusing on coordinated optimization and the techni-
cal challenges involved. Section 7 explores future research

communication, resource management, AI integration, and
application-specific innovations like edge intelligence and ve-
hicular network intelligence. The conclusion advocates for
interdisciplinary collaboration to overcome technical and reg-
ulatory barriers in smart cities, healthcare, and autonomous
systems.
II. AGI A PPROACHES AND METHODOLOGIES
To provide a structured understanding of existing method-
ologies, this section begins with the Core Categories of AGI
Architectures in IoX, outlining key architectural approaches
based on their foundational principles and relevance to IoT
environments. This is followed by an overview of integrated
AGI techniques across the sensing, network, and application
layers, illustrating how layered intelligence enables adaptive
and context-aware behaviors. We then present a taxonomy of
AGI-enhanced IoX architectures, highlighting four dominant
paradigms that reflect key design priorities. Finally, we offer
a critical analysis of recent studies that exemplify these ap-
proaches through practical implementations, drawing insights
into their capabilities, challenges, and real-world applicability.
In order to provide a coherent understanding of the exist-
ings methodologies, this section classifies the different AGI
architectures into distinct categories based on their underlying
principles and their applications within IoT environments. We
aim to highlight both their synergies and trade-offs, offering
a clearer picture of how each method contributes to the
development of smarter, more efficient IoT systems.
A. Core Categories of AGI Architectures in IoX
The architectural approaches presented here can be broadly
grouped into three key categories:
• Hybrid AI Architectures This category encompasses ap-
proaches that blend different AI techniques to leverage
PREPRINT ARXIV 5
Fig. 2. Bottleneck issues rises in IoX
Fig. 3. Three-Layer AGI-Enabled IoX Architecture
the strengths of both machine learning and symbolic
reasoning. Among these, neuro-symbolic AI, Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG), and Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) represent innovative strategies that aim
to balance performance, robustness, and explainability.
These methods are particularly valuable in IoT applica-
tions that require sophisticated reasoning and adaptability,
while still maintaining transparency and interpretability.
• Distributed Intelligence: With the increasing scale and
complexity of IoT systems, there is a growing need for
architectures that distribute computation and decision-
making closer to the data source. Edge Intelligence and
Federated Learning are two prominent approaches within
this theme, both of which emphasize reducing latency, en-
hancing data privacy, and improving resource efficiency.
These architectures are especially relevant in resource-
constrained IoT environments, where centralized cloud
processing is less feasible or desirable.
• Generative AI and Language Models: As IoT systems
become more context-aware and dynamic, the need for
adaptive, content-generating models has increased. Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, and Generative
AI (GAI) techniques, are pivotal in enabling IoT systems
to generate relevant data, improve decision-making, and
enhance overall system responsiveness. These models
offer a flexible, data-driven approach to handling the
complexity and unpredictability often present in IoT
environments.
Each of these categories reflects different facets of AI’s role
in advancing IoT technology, and in the following sections,
we will explore the specific characteristics, strengths, and
challenges of each approach. By contextualizing these ar-
chitectures within real-world use cases and comparing their
applications, we will outline how these methods are shaping
the future of IoT, from privacy-preserving frameworks to the
integration of generative capabilities for enhanced decision-
making.
B. Overview of AGI Techniques
The integrated AGI architecture represents a hierarchical
system where three fundamental layers: sensing, network, and
application are stacked vertically, with data flowing upward
through the system. At the sensing layer (bottom), raw data
collection and preprocessing occur through sensor networks
and edge devices, with studies showing unsupervised learning
methods for multi-modal feature detection in IoT sensor data
[29]. The network layer (middle) handles data transmission
and protocol management, while the application layer (top)
focuses on high-level decision-making and user interactions,
PREPRINT ARXIV 6
utilizing hierarchical meta-learning to improve adaptability
and precision [30]. These layers are unified through three
key AGI components that span across them: Neuro-symbolic
reasoning primarily couples the sensing and network layers,
enabling improved data efficiency and robustness [31]. Active
inference frameworks bridge network and application layers,
facilitating adaptive decision-making and goal-directed be-
havior [32]. Large language models and foundation models
predominantly operate across application and network layers,
enabling sophisticated reasoning and contextual understanding
[33], [34]. Within each layer, specific functionalities are im-
plemented: the sensing layer incorporates multi-modal feature
detection and preprocessing [29], the network layer manages
semantic communications and edge intelligence [35], and the
application layer handles high-level reasoning and decision-
making processes through agent-based foundation models
[36]. This integrated architecture enables comprehensive sys-
tem optimization through joint sensing, communication, and
AI frameworks [37].
Within the IoX architecture, the sensing, network, and appli-
cation layers serve as the foundational structure supporting
three interrelated dimensions: the IoT, IoP, and IoK. AGI
techniques enhance these layers by enabling more adaptive,
human-centric, and cognitively aware functionalities. Specifi-
cally, AGI empowers the application layer to support IoP by
facilitating context-aware, proactive interactions using tech-
niques like large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning, and multi-agent systems. These enable personalized
services based on users’ sociological profiles, preferences, and
behaviors — for example, customizing mobility services in
smart cities [6]. Simultaneously, AGI strengthens the network
and application layers to support IoK by enabling distributed
knowledge discovery, semantic integration, and collaborative
intelligence. Generative AI and symbolic reasoning are em-
ployed to create real-time, shared knowledge bases across
nodes, making it possible to unify heterogeneous data sources
for intelligent decision-making in domains such as smart
mobility and emergency response [33, 38] By embedding
intelligence into these layers, AGI extends the capabilities of
IoX to meet the demands of both IoP’s social layer and IoK’s
cognitive layer, facilitating a more responsive and knowledge-
driven CPST ecosystem. In this way, AGI techniques not only
enhance individual IoX layers but also act as enablers for
realizing the full potential of IoP and IoK, aligning the system
with the multidimensional goals of CPST integration.
Figure 3 illustrates a conceptual AGI-enhanced IoX archi-
tecture in which three functional layers—sensing, network,
and application—are augmented by cross-layer intelligence
modules. The sensing layer at the base is responsible for
raw data acquisition and edge-level preprocessing (e.g., un-
supervised multi-modal feature detection, brain cognition-
inspired frameworks, and active sensing mechanisms). Imme-
diately above, the network layer handles federated learning
with blockchain security, information-centric networking, and
semantic-native processing, supporting multi-agent systems
for distributed resource management. The application layer
at the top encompasses mixture-of-experts decision-making
and knowledge representation frameworks, leveraging GPT-
enhanced reasoning and generative AI services. Bridging these
layers are three AGI components: neuro-symbolic explainable
AI twins integrate uncertainty-quantified inference across the
sensing and network domains; active inference frameworks
enable adaptive perception and goal-directed planning between
the network and application domains. Together, these elements
form a tightly coupled loop of meta-learning and semantic
communication protocols, enabling end-to-end optimization
of sensing, communication, and reasoning in complex cyber-
physical-social-thinking environments.
III. R ESEARCH AND SURVEY METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the methodology employed to conduct
a comprehensive review of AGI-enhanced solutions for ad-
dressing bottlenecks in IoX systems, particularly within Cyber-
Physical-Social-Thinking (CPST) frameworks. The method-
ology encompasses the systematic identification, screening,
and analysis of relevant academic literature to address the
research question: how AGI can mitigate sensing, network, and
application layer challenges in CPST-enabled IoX systems,
and what advantages it offers over narrow AI. The approach is
structured into three key phases: screening criteria establish-
ment, database collection, and data analysis and synthesis.
A. Screening Criteria
To ensure the inclusion of studies most relevant to the
research objectives, a rigorous set of screening criteria was
developed. These criteria focused on the alignment of studies
with AGI applications in IoX or IoT contexts, their relevance
to CPST ecosystems, and their contributions to addressing spe-
cific layer-based bottlenecks. The screening process involved
a holistic evaluation of each study based on the following
criteria:
• AGI Focus: Studies were required to explicitly address
AGI or advanced AI methodologies applicable to IoX
or IoT systems. This included approaches such as neuro-
symbolic reasoning, active inference, causal reasoning, or
foundation models that demonstrate general intelligence
capabilities beyond narrow AI.
• CPST Context: Studies needed to operate within or be
applicable to CPST frameworks, which integrate cyber,
physical, social, and cognitive dimensions. This ensured
relevance to the complex, interdisciplinary nature of IoX
systems.
• Sensing Layer Relevance: Studies were evaluated for
proposing AGI-driven solutions to sensing layer bottle-
necks, such as data overload, energy constraints, noise re-
duction, or adaptive sampling. Examples include adaptive
sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, or selective attention
mechanisms.
• Network Layer Relevance: Studies were included if they
addressed network layer challenges using AGI, such as
protocol heterogeneity, dynamic spectrum management,
security risks, or intermittent connectivity. Solutions like
semantic communications or distributed learning were
prioritized.
PREPRINT ARXIV 7
• Application Layer Relevance: Studies tackling appli-
cation layer issues, such as identity explosion, cogni-
tive feedback loops, or real-time context-aware decision-
making (e.g., via semantic modeling or knowledge
graphs), were considered for inclusion.
Each study was assessed holistically, considering all criteria
collectively to determine its relevance. Papers that partially
met these criteria but offered significant insights into cross-
layer integration or AGI’s comparative advantages were also
included to ensure a comprehensive review.
B. Database Collection
The literature collection process aimed to gather a broad,
relevant set of academic papers from authoritative sources.
A comprehensive search was conducted using Google Scholar
as the primary database due to its extensive indexing coverage
across disciplines. The search employed specific search strings
to ensure transparency and reproducibility:
• ”Artificial General Intelligence” AND ”Internet of ” OR
”IoX” OR ”Internet of everything”
• ”AGI” AND ”Sensing Layer” AND ”IoX”
• ”AGI” AND (”Edge Intelligence” OR ”Federated Learn-
ing”) AND ”Network Layer”
• ”AGI” AND ”Application Layer” AND ”CPST”
• ”Internet of People” OR ”Internet of Thinking” OR
”Internet of Brain”
The search returned 1320 records. Initial filtering removed
270 duplicates and 30 records for other reasons (e.g., non-
English, non-peer-reviewed), leaving 1020 records for screen-
ing based on titles and abstracts. Of these, 810 were excluded
for not meeting the inclusion criteria. The remaining 210 re-
ports were sought for retrieval, with 195 successfully retrieved.
Full eligibility assessment excluded 97 reports for reasons
including lack of AGI relevance (n=35), absence of CPST
context (n=30), or insufficient detail (n=32). Ultimately, 98
studies were included in the review, matching the PRISMA
diagram as depicted in Figure 4.
To enhance scholarly rigor, key papers were cross-verified
using Semantic Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and SpringerLink. This
step validated the relevance and quality of included studies
and provided full-text access where Google Scholar links were
insufficient. These supplementary databases were not used for
the initial search but ensured a robust final corpus.
C. Data Analysis and Synthesis
Following the screening and collection of relevant studies, a
systematic approach was employed to analyze and synthesize
the data. This phase involved extracting key information from
each study, categorizing findings by IoX layer, and identifying
thematic insights into AGI’s role in addressing CPST-enabled
IoX challenges. The analysis was conducted manually to
ensure accuracy and depth, focusing on the following aspects:
• Dimensions of Data Extraction and Analysis: A sys-
tematic data extraction process was employed to analyze
the integration of AGI within IoX systems. This analysis
focused on key areas including research methodologies,
system architectures, adaptive mechanisms, practical ap-
plications, and future research directions. By examining
these dimensions, the process provides a comprehensive
overview of AGI’s role in enhancing IoX ecosystems and
its real-world impact across various domains.
– Research Approach and AGI Methodology: The
primary AGI methodology (e.g., cognitive architec-
ture, reasoning framework) was identified, along with
key cognitive abilities explored (e.g., perception,
reasoning) and novel computational approaches (e.g.,
hyper-dimensional computing).
– System Architecture and Layer Interactions: De-
tails on the IoX layers addressed (sensing, network,
application) were extracted, with emphasis on AGI
mechanisms for cross-layer integration and optimiza-
tion strategies.
– AGI Adaptive Mechanisms: Adaptive techniques
(e.g., selective attention, edge preprocessing) were
documented, noting how they addressed system
constraints and incorporated learning or self-
optimization.
– Use Case and Practical Applications: Specific use

IV. B OTTLENECKS IN IOX LAYERS
The technical bottlenecks in IoX systems form an intricate
web of interconnected challenges that span multiple archi-
tectural layers, creating systemic inefficiencies that transcend
individual components. These impediments manifest differ-
ently across sensing, network, and application layers, yet
their effects cascade throughout the entire system, producing
compound challenges greater than the sum of their individual
impacts. At the Sensing Layer, fundamental tensions emerge
between data acquisition quality and resource utilization,
where issues like sensory overload, environmental noise, and
data fusion complexities hinder actionable insight extraction.
Limitations in real-time context-awareness further restrict
adaptive responsiveness, creating foundational constraints that
propagate upward through the system architecture. IoP in-
troduces additional bottlenecks by requiring context-aware
processing of multimodal social data (e.g., user preferences),
which can exacerbate data overload. AGI-driven selective
attention mechanisms, such as those using neuro-symbolic
reasoning, mitigate this by prioritizing relevant inputs [6].
The Network Layer grapples with dual pressures of scal-
ability and interoperability in heterogeneous environments,
where bandwidth constraints strain communication efficiency
and protocol fragmentation complicates cross-system integra-
tion. Simultaneously, the Application Layer contends with
decision-making under uncertain or incomplete data streams,
while facing persistent security vulnerabilities and the need
for dynamic adaptation to evolving user requirements. What
makes these layer-specific challenges particularly pernicious is
their tendency to interact and amplify across layer boundaries
– sensing limitations distort network payloads, network con-
straints degrade application inputs, and application demands
exacerbate resource competition at lower layers.
Understanding these multidimensional bottlenecks requires
analyzing both their domain-specific characteristics and their
cross-layer implications. The following sections examine these
challenges in detail, evaluating their technical origins, systemic
impacts, and emerging solutions aimed at enhancing IoX
system performance through holistic architectural integration.
A. Network Layer Constraints
The network layer in IoX systems faces several critical chal-
lenges that significantly impact overall system performance,
creating a complex ecosystem of interconnected technical bot-
tlenecks that demand careful consideration and management.
1) Spectrum Scarcity and Interference: The primary chal-
lenge in this domain relates to the management of limited
spectrum resources and interference mitigation. Authors in
[46] identify severe interference problems arising from over-
crowding in unlicensed frequency bands, which compromises
reliable communication and data transmission integrity. This
issue is particularly acute in CR-IoT systems, where:
• Noise uncertainties in low SNR environments lead to
deteriorated probability of detection
• Sensing threshold selection significantly affects overall
performance
• Short packet transmissions require precise optimization
of sensing time These factors collectively contribute to

2) Routing Inefficiencies: The complexity of routing in IoX
networks presents another significant challenge. the study in
[47] highlight several critical issues:
• Multi-hop wireless links lead to suboptimal routing path
selection.
• Coverage area restrictions impact network reach and
effectiveness.
• Path selection algorithms struggle with dynamic network
topology changes.
• Network congestion creates additional routing challenges
These routing inefficiencies ultimately affect the system’s
ability to efficiently transmit data across the network.
3) Bandwidth and Latency Issues: Bandwidth constraints
and their impact on system performance represent a third
major challenge. Authors in [45] demonstrate several key
impacts including:
• Direct relationship between bandwidth constraints and
increased latency.
• Significant impact on base station power dissipation.
• Quality of Service (QoS) degradation in high-traffic sce-
narios.
• Reduced network throughput and increased packet loss
rates: The bandwidth limitations create a cascading effect
that impacts multiple aspects of network performance.
4) Protocol Heterogeneity and Spectrum Scarcity: IoX net-
works face significant challenges with protocol compatibility
and spectrum usage. [42] identifies substantial interoperabil-
ity issues arising from differences in platforms, communica-
tion protocols, and data formats. The spectrum environment
presents additional challenges, with [46] highlighting severe
interference problems due to overcrowding in unlicensed
frequency bands for CR-IoT systems. These protocol and
spectrum issues contribute to performance degradation, where
[45] emphasizes the significant impact on latency and base
station power dissipation. Integration across different protocols
creates additional complications, with [41] and [48] identi-
fying network congestion and bandwidth allocation as key
challenges in data exchange between heterogeneous IoT com-
ponents. Furthermore, the increasing integration of cognitive
functions—such as semantic reasoning and distributed knowl-
edge sharing, as envisioned in the IoK exacerbates these chal-
lenges. IoK requires semantic interoperability across nodes,
adding additional strain on protocol compatibility, bandwidth,
and synchronization mechanisms in real-time scenarios[32].
B. Sensing Layer Bottlenecks
1) Energy, Accuracy, and Environmental Constraints: The
interconnected nature of IoX system layers creates a complex
web of performance challenges that cascade throughout the
entire architecture. At the sensing layer, interference and band-
width constraints significantly impact data acquisition quality,
with authors in [49] noting that current algorithms struggle to
simultaneously optimize sensing accuracy and communication
efficiency. These challenges are compounded at the application
layer, where authors in [50] report that latency and rout-
ing inefficiencies lead to processing bottlenecks and system
crashes, particularly in high-workload scenarios. Authors in
[51] further emphasizes how varying Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements across different environments complicate service
delivery.
Environmental factors pose a significant bottleneck to precise
localization, particularly when using RSSI models with BLE
beacons. [52] highlight how complex environments, character-
ized by physical obstacles, signal interference, and mobility
constraints, undermine the accuracy of distance estimation.
These challenges are further amplified by the need for offline
data processing and the limited range of BLE, which requires
PREPRINT ARXIV 10
slower and more deliberate scanning approaches by mobile
agents such as UA Vs and ground robots[53]. These constraints
reveal critical limitations in achieving seamless and real-time
interaction and localization across interconnected IoX systems.
2) Performance Management Challenges: The manage-
ment of performance challenges in IoX systems demands
a sophisticated approach to balancing multiple competing
factors and constraints. [54] demonstrate that effective re-
source allocation strategies must carefully balance competing
demands across different system components, while simul-
taneously maintaining optimal energy efficiency and latency
requirements. Dynamic adaptation mechanisms play a crucial
role, with [49] showing that adaptive sensing algorithms
must continuously respond to changing network conditions to
maintain system performance. [45] emphasize the importance
of evaluating trade-offs between various performance metrics,
noting that improvements in one area often come at the cost
of degradation in others, particularly in terms of bandwidth
utilization and latency. Authors in [50] further highlight how
system optimization requires careful consideration of both
local and global performance impacts, as high workload sce-
narios can lead to cascading failures across different system
components if not properly managed. This complex interplay
of factors necessitates a holistic approach to performance
management that can dynamically adjust to changing con-
ditions while maintaining optimal system efficiency across
all operational parameters. Building upon these challenges, a
critical aspect of maintaining overall IoX system performance
lies in effective dataflow management, which faces additional
complexities due to data overload and security vulnerabili-
ties, particularly at the sensing and network layers. Dataflow
management in IoX systems is hindered by data overload
and security vulnerabilities, particularly at the sensing and
network layers, which impede real-time processing and re-
liable communication [55]. AGI’s adaptive data fusion and
semantic communication strategies offer promising solutions
to these bottlenecks. These interconnected challenges create a
complex web of constraints that must be carefully managed to
maintain acceptable network performance levels in IoX sys-
tems. The successful implementation of IoX networks requires
comprehensive strategies that address these challenges while
considering their interdependencies and cross-layer impacts.
The complexity of these network layer constraints highlights
the need for innovative solutions that can address multiple
challenges simultaneously while maintaining system stability
and performance. Future developments in IoX systems will
need to focus on creating more robust and adaptive networking
solutions that can effectively manage these various constraints
while supporting the growing demands of IoX applications.
The combined effects of these layer-specific challenges cre-
ate system-wide bottlenecks that significantly impact overall
performance, with [54] demonstrating that cross-layer opti-
mization approaches can achieve substantial improvements
in both latency (51.53% reduction) and energy consumption
(52.88% improvement). These interconnected challenges un-
derscore the need for holistic solutions that address bottlenecks
across all system layers while maintaining optimal perfor-
mance and reliability.
C. Application Layer Bottlenecks
The application layer in IoX systems faces critical technical
challenges that degrade performance, reliability, and security.
Key bottlenecks identified in the literature include:
1) High CPU and Memory Demands: Resource-intensive
applications, particularly those deployed in fog or cloud envi-
ronments, strain computational resources. Studies report that
excessive CPU usage and memory limitations in IoT agents
lead to system instability and crashes, especially under high
workloads [50]. For instance, general-purpose IoT enablers
are often ill-equipped to handle real-time data processing in
scenarios like industrial automation or emergency response,
resulting in performance degradation.
2) Quality of Service (QoS) Variability: Dynamic QoS
requirements across different operational environments (e.g.,
smart cities vs. vehicular networks) create challenges in re-
source allocation and prioritization. [51] highlight that vari-
ability in latency, bandwidth, and reliability requirements
complicates the design of universally effective IoX applica-
tions. This inconsistency is particularly problematic for delay-
sensitive use cases, such as autonomous vehicles or healthcare
monitoring.
3) Security Vulnerabilities: The application layer is sus-
ceptible to remotely exploitable weaknesses in authentication,
access control, and data integrity. For example, authors in [56]
identify vulnerabilities in service authentication mechanisms
that expose systems to cyberattacks. These flaws are exacer-
bated by the heterogeneous nature of IoX ecosystems, where
fragmented security protocols across devices and platforms
create entry points for breaches.
4) Processing Limitations: Limited processing capabilities
of edge devices constrain real-time decision-making and sys-
tem responsiveness. In Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) ap-
plications, delays in environmental sensing and computational
decision-making hinder mission-critical operations [40]. Simi-
larly, [50] note that high message rates overwhelm application-
layer components, leading to bottlenecks in data handling and
system crashes. IoP’s focus on social dynamics and IoK’s
knowledge management introduce challenges like managing
privacy-sensitive social interactions and integrating complex
knowledge graphs. These bottlenecks collectively degrade user
experience, compromise system reliability, and expose IoX
deployments to security risks. For instance, QoS variability
undermines the effectiveness of time-sensitive applications,
while processing limitations restrict scalability in large-scale
deployments.
Table I outlines major IoX bottlenecks, their affected layers,
and existing non-AGI solutions. It highlights how challenges
at different layers impact overall system performance.
D. Taxonomy of AGI-Enhanced IoX Architectures
This section presents a structured taxonomy that organizes
AGI-enhanced IoX architectures into a comprehensive, layered
framework. Rather than emphasizing abstract architectural
paradigms, the taxonomy is grounded in a practical, function-
oriented perspective across three foundational layers: Sensing,
Network, and Application. Each layer is further divided into
PREPRINT ARXIV 11
key subcategories, reflecting how AGI techniques are applied
to address specific technical challenges, including perception,
data transmission, decision-making, and coordination.
Figure 5 illustrates this taxonomy, which captures the mul-
tidimensional integration of AGI within the IoX ecosystem.
It delineates how AGI methods—such as neuro-symbolic
learning, active inference, generative modeling, and decentral-
ized reasoning—are embedded across architectural layers to
enhance system intelligence, efficiency, and autonomy. The
sensing layer emphasizes intelligent data acquisition, real-time
responsiveness, multi-modal fusion, and autonomous opera-
tion. The network layer covers context-aware communication,
resource management, edge intelligence, and secure data han-
dling. The application layer focuses on high-level reasoning,
urban intelligence, semantic understanding, and multi-agent
collaboration.
Beyond the layered view, the taxonomy also considers key
cross-cutting dimensions: system architecture , implementa-
tion focus , enabling technologies, and application domains.
Together, these perspectives provide a coherent and actionable
framework to understand how AGI technologies are reshaping
the IoX landscape and to guide future innovations in intelligent
cyber-physical systems.
1) Sensing: The sensing layer forms the foundational in-
terface between the physical environment and the digital
infrastructure of IoX systems. It encompasses mechanisms for
data acquisition, fusion, and preprocessing, where AGI tech-
nologies play a critical role in elevating system intelligence at
the edge. Specifically, AGI enhances perception by integrating
neuro-symbolic models, real-time decision-making through
active inference frameworks, and multi-modal sensor fusion
using adaptive learning. Additionally, this layer increasingly
incorporates autonomous capabilities through decentralized
agents and reinforcement learning, enabling intelligent sensing
strategies that adapt to dynamic environments. These advances
support not only high-accuracy data capture but also context-
aware interpretation and low-latency responsiveness essential
for mission-critical and real-time applications.
• Machine Learning Approaches: Intelligent machine
learning algorithms are increasingly used to process sen-
sor data efficiently and improve inference in complex
environments. Several works propose frameworks that
incorporate neuro-symbolic learning for robust, inter-
pretable sensor processing in dynamic scenarios, such
as battlefield systems. Others demonstrate how transfer
learning and model compression techniques like pruning
enable efficient deployment of deep learning models in
resource-constrained IoT settings. Additionally, unsuper-
vised clustering methods at the edge help preprocess
heterogeneous sensor streams for higher-level cognition
in the cloud [29, 31, 57]. Furthermore, hybrid human-
artificial intelligence architectures enhance these frame-
works by combining human-like reasoning with compu-
tational efficiency, offering robust solutions for complex
social and cognitive interactions in IoX systems [58].
• Real-time Processing: Real-time adaptability is achieved
through architectures that jointly optimize sensing, com-
munication, and AI processing. Techniques such as tensor
decomposition, cognition-inspired decision-making, and
edge-based active inference enable fast and adaptive
responses in high-interference or mobile environments
[37, 59, 60]. Additionally, the synergy of communication,
computing, and caching optimizes smart sensing across
all layers, with AGI’s cross-layer integration addressing
systemic bottlenecks [61].
• Multi-modal Sensing: To address the complexity of
diverse IoT environments, multi-modal sensing integrates
data from various sources using advanced fusion tech-
niques. Research in this area includes meta-learning
frameworks that improve predictive accuracy and system
efficiency, as well as reconfigurable surfaces that enhance
communication fidelity for robotic systems [30, 62].
• Autonomous Sensing: Autonomous sensing mechanisms
leverage AGI for intelligent decision-making in dynamic
environments. This includes multi-agent reinforcement
learning for spectrum access in connected vehicles, and
decentralized crowdsensing solutions that integrate hu-
man and machine contributions, supported by blockchain
for trust and verification [63, 64].
• Context Awareness: AGI enhances context awareness
by processing multimodal data (e.g., location, activity,
social interactions) to create dynamic sociological profiles
that capture user preferences and moods. Techniques like
neuro-symbolic reasoning and active inference enable
real-time adaptation to complex contexts, such as detect-
ing traffic delays or user stress, improving personalization
in smart transportation scenarios [6].
• Proactive Interactions: AGI automates device orches-
tration by reasoning about optimal actions across hetero-
geneous devices (e.g., smartphones, traffic systems). It
enables proactive behaviors, such as rerouting vehicles
or suggesting social activities, by leveraging generative
AI and reinforcement learning, addressing scalability
challenges in large-scale IoP systems [6].
2) Network: The network layer oversees the transmission,
routing, and coordination of data across distributed IoX nodes.
AGI enhances this layer by introducing intelligent, context-
aware communication through techniques such as semantic
communications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and
AI-assisted protocol adaptation, thereby reducing redundancy
and improving data relevance. Additionally, AGI facilitates
dynamic resource allocation via reinforcement learning and
federated decision-making, optimizing bandwidth, latency,
and throughput. Edge intelligence enables real-time infer-
ence near data sources, while privacy-preserving mechanisms
and blockchain-based verification reinforce security and trust
among heterogeneous and autonomous agents.
• Semantic Communications Semantic-aware systems
enable more efficient data exchange by interpreting
the meaning of transmitted content. This is achieved
through AI-driven protocols and natural language pro-
cessing techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Gener-
ation (RAG), improving communication efficiency and
reliability across sensory and vehicular networks [35, 38].
Furthermore, addressing the challenge of exploding con-
PREPRINT ARXIV 12
nections in IoX relies on advanced AI-driven protocols
like semantic communications to ensure efficient data
exchange [65].
• Resource Management: AGI methods optimize network
throughput and latency by dynamically managing spec-
trum and compute resources. Hybrid models employing
reinforcement learning and spectrum sharing, along with
virtualization at the network edge, support scalable and
intelligent resource allocation strategies [66, 67].
• Edge Computing: To reduce latency and enhance re-
sponsiveness, distributed intelligence is applied at the
edge of the network. Approaches include decentralized
learning in Tactile IoT environments and assumed edge
AI techniques for real-time adaptation in AGI-enhanced
systems [68, 69].
• Security & Privacy: Security solutions combine AGI
techniques with federated learning, blockchain, and de-
centralized decision-making to ensure secure spectrum
access, privacy-preserving data sharing, and integrity in
integrated space-air-ground networks [63, 70, 71].
3) Application: The application layer constitutes the cog-
nitive and interactive component of the IoX architecture,
encompassing user-facing services, system-level reasoning,
and collaborative intelligence. AGI technologies at this layer
enable autonomous decision-making, semantic understanding
via large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs, and
adaptive responses in dynamic environments. Urban intelli-
gence platforms utilize AGI to integrate spatiotemporal data
and deliver scalable, real-time solutions to societal and envi-
ronmental challenges. Furthermore, generative AI and hybrid
symbolic-neural models enhance knowledge representation
and scenario planning, while collaborative multi-agent systems
support distributed problem-solving in areas such as mobility,
energy, and public safety.
• Autonomous Systems: Advanced driving and smart mo-
bility applications benefit from AGI by incorporating
foundation models, generative AI, and scenario-aware
decision-making. These systems leverage multi-modal
inputs for improved navigation, reasoning, and planning
in autonomous settings [36, 38, 72].
• Urban Intelligence: Urban environments are becoming
smarter through multi-agent systems powered by large
language models. These enable real-time analytics, spa-
tiotemporal data visualization, and secure information
sharing during crises [33, 73]. Moreover, hybrid human-
artificial intelligence enhances social computing by en-
abling IoX systems to model and respond to social
dynamics, advocating for AGI’s role in social intelligence
within CPST frameworks [74].
• Knowledge Representation: Knowledge modeling in
AGI-enabled IoX systems is supported by structured
graph architectures, symbolic AI, and active inference.
These methods enable systems to generalize, adapt, and
provide meaningful insights in real time across diverse
IoT domains [32, 75, 76].
• Multi-agent Systems: Collaborative intelligence is
achieved through generative agents and interaction-aware
frameworks. These systems enhance adaptability and
reasoning in environments such as smart infrastructure
and 6G networks, where communication efficiency and
decision coordination are critical [77–79].
Additionally, the exploration of hybrid human-artificial in-
telligence for multimedia computing enhances context-aware
decision-making and multi-agent coordination, supporting AGI
integration in CPST ecosystems [80].
4) Human-Centric Intelligence: Human-centric AGI inte-
gration in IoX emphasizes adaptability, memory retention,
emotional awareness, and personalized interaction, enabling
systems to align more closely with human expectations and
behavior.
• Modular Architectures: Human-aligned AGI
frameworks increasingly adopt modular architectures
comprising perception, world modeling, and action-
planning components. These architectures leverage
hyper-dimensional computing to dynamically allocate
network resources in immersive environments such as
digital twins and XR applications, supporting seamless
connectivity and responsiveness [81].
• Interactive Frameworks: Adaptive decision-making in
IoX is supported by interactive frameworks that struc-
ture intelligence across environment sensing, perception,
cognitive reasoning, and actuation. By integrating LLMs
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), these systems
achieve unified understanding across heterogeneous IoP
data sources and enable responsive, context-aware net-
work control [82].
• Context Retention: AI-native memory systems underpin
personalization by incorporating deep neural memory
layers and Lifelong Personal Models. These systems
continuously learn from user behavior to retain relevant
contextual information, enabling proactive engagement
in applications such as memory-augmented dialogue,
recommendations, and assistive services [83].
• Social and Emotional Intelligence: AGI systems are
evolving to recognize and respond to emotional and social
cues, fostering empathetic human-machine interaction.
This capability is vital in domains such as personalized
tutoring, collaborative teamwork, and social robotics,
where systems must interpret nuanced human intent and
adapt communication strategies accordingly [84, 85].

V. C RITICAL ANALYSIS OF AGI-I OX IMPLEMENTATIONS
To systematically evaluate AGI-IoX implementations, Ta-
ble II summarizes the existing studies across sensing, net-
work, and application layers. The following critical analysis
discusses these works in detail, organized by the layers they
address and their methodological approaches (conceptual or
experimental), aligning with the structure of the table and
taxonomy.
A. Sensing Layer
1) Experimental Approaches: The study [29] proposes a
generic preprocessing architecture that employs AGI-driven
perception mechanisms for IoT systems. The framework in-
tegrates an unsupervised clustering algorithm and a dynamic
stimulus labeling mechanism to abstract multi-modal sensor
data into structured feature sets at the edge. This enables
higher-order cognitive functions in the cloud. While the study
emphasizes explainable AI through transparent feature ab-
straction and supports applications like cognitive virtual as-
sistants, it does not provide quantitative performance metrics.
The architecture’s edge/cloud integration and adaptive cluster-
ing mechanisms suggest potential for scalable AGI systems,
though experimental validation remains future work.
B. Network Layer
1) Conceptual Approaches: The study [69] proposes a con-
ceptual framework for Tactile Network of Things (TNT)-IoT
platforms, targeting the network layer with distributed machine
learning. The design introduces an intelligent adaptation layer
to enhance coordination and adaptability in heterogeneous
tactile networks. It emphasizes dynamic resource allocation
and decentralized learning strategies.
2) Experimental Approaches: The paper [66] presents a
hybrid model that integrates Device-to-Device (D2D) commu-
nication with traditional network infrastructures. It uses mech-
anisms such as Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), Reinforce-
ment Learning (RL)-based Resource Allocation, Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC), Differential Privacy Techniques, Swarm
Intelligence-based Routing, Cognitive Radio Networks, Self-
Healing Network Protocols, and Low-Power Communication
Protocols. The model is experimentally evaluated, showing
improvements in throughput, latency, energy efficiency, and
adaptability. Specifically, it achieves a throughput improve-
ment of up to 950 Mbps compared to existing methods, while
preserving privacy through differential privacy techniques.
C. Application Layer
1) Conceptual Approaches: Conceptual approaches in the
application layer explore various methods to enhance AI
capabilities in IoT systems. These methods include sen-
sory grounding, knowledge representation, active inference,
retrieval-augmented generation, foundation models, and AGI
integration. The following studies illustrate these approaches
and their potential impact on improving understanding, nav-
igation, adaptive behavior, reliability, perception, decision-
making, and early warning systems in IoT and related do-
mains. The study by [90] focuses on the application layer
by proposing the embodiment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
through 6G networks. The conceptual framework suggests
that 6G-enabled sensory grounding could significantly improve
AI’s contextual understanding capabilities. This paper [75]
proposes a conceptual system-level knowledge representation
architecture targeting the application layer for IoT systems.
The study theorizes that structured knowledge graphs could
enable cognitive navigation for IoT devices operating in dy-
namic environments. It emphasizes the role of semantic rea-
soning in contextual adaptability. As a theoretical framework,
it posits that hierarchical knowledge representation supports
decision-making by encoding environmental relationships and
constraints, though the work does not include experimental
validation. Instead, it argues for the potential of integrating
symbolic AI with IoT systems to enhance autonomy through
interpretable, logic-driven navigation strategies. The paper
[32] addresses the application layer using active inference
for intelligence ecosystems. The theoretical work proposes
active inference as a unified ”physics of intelligence” en-
abling adaptive goal-directed behavior. The DriveRP frame-
work [38] leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and prompt engineering to enhance the application layer of
autonomous driving systems. This integration aims to improve
system reliability and scenario understanding by addressing
challenges such as hallucinations, outdated context, and the
long-tail problem in autonomous driving environments. The
study by [36] targets the application layer through agent-
based foundation models for smart mobility. It emphasizes
the importance of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
vehicles. The paper highlights how foundation models, pre-
trained on diverse data, are critical for advanced reasoning,
scene perception, and decision-making in autonomous driving.
It introduces Agent-based Foundation Models (AFMs), a new
paradigm designed to enhance collaboration and interaction
in smart mobility systems. AFMs integrate multi-modal data,
support cross-domain actions, and enable multi-agent collab-
oration, thus offering a scalable solution for adaptive robot
navigation and collaborative agent behaviors. The authors
propose a framework integrating decentralized systems and
cloud-edge resources, underscoring the potential for AFMs to
drive the next generation of intelligent transportation solutions.
The paper [73] addresses the application layer via AGI-
driven intelligence fusion networks for crisis management.
It proposes a novel IFN architecture that integrates AGI for
real-time data analysis and decision support, and blockchain
for secure, decentralized data sharing. The study outlines
a three-phase workflow—pre-crisis, during-crisis, and post-
crisis—and highlights ethical considerations including privacy
protection and accountability systems. Through a case study
of the Minnesota Joint Analysis Center during the 2008
Republican National Convention, the paper demonstrates the
practical relevance of fusion centers. It emphasizes the need
for proactive, data-driven approaches in managing complex
crisis scenarios. These conceptual studies collectively advance
the theoretical foundations of AGI-enhanced IoX systems,
proposing innovative methods to integrate AI capabilities at
the application level. While experimental validation is needed,
they lay the groundwork for future developments in intelligent
PREPRINT ARXIV 17
IoX applications.
2) Experimental Approaches: The paper [33] focuses on
the application layer through CityGPT, an experimental multi-
agent system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs)
for urban IoT analysis. The framework supports spatiotem-
poral data learning, analysis, and visualization by leveraging
agents such as temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal fusion
agents. The study demonstrates strong performance in IoT
computing and highlights advancements in hyperparameter
optimization and spatial similarity analysis. The paper [77]
proposes a ’GPT-in-the-loop’ framework that integrates GPT-4
to improve reasoning and adaptability in multiagent systems.
Applied to a smart streetlight use case, the framework op-
erates at the application layer, optimizing autonomous agent
decision-making and behavior programming. Compared to
neuroevolutionary methods and human-engineered solutions,
it achieves superior energy efficiency and decision quality,
attaining a fitness score of 62.44 with fewer iterations.
D. Sensing & Network Layers
1) Conceptual Approaches: Authors in [31] address the
sensing and network layers through a neuro-symbolic machine
learning architecture designed for the Internet of Battlefield
Things (IoBT). This conceptual study demonstrates that inte-
grated neuro-symbolic inference enhances data efficiency, ro-
bustness, and interpretability in battlefield environments. The
paper [62] spans sensing and network layers through Reconfig-
urable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) for Internet of Robotic Things
(IoRT). The conceptual design enhances robotic communi-
cation reliability through optimized beamforming, leveraging
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to mitigate signal
degradation, extend coverage, and improve signal alignment
in both far-field and near-field scenarios.
2) Experimental Approaches: The study by [63] explores
sensing and network layers with experimental secure spec-
trum access designed for the Internet of Connected Vehicles
(IoCV). It utilizes multi-agent Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)
for hybrid beamforming, achieving a spectral efficiency of
92% in congested urban environments. This is accomplished
by optimizing spectrum utilization, minimizing latency, and
improving communication reliability through secure routing
and effective spectrum handoff mechanisms.
The paper [59] addresses sensing and network layers in the
context of an air-ground integrated AIoT framework. It in-
troduces a novel communication framework inspired by brain
cognition to manage interference in integrated aerial-terrestrial
networks. The framework employs cognitive heuristics and
deep learning techniques to optimize signal processing, reduce
interference, and improve communication quality. By itera-
tively determining the importance of signals, the framework
eliminates unimportant signals with interference characteris-
tics and reduces their transmission power. The paper highlights
the iterative improvement of interference management and the
optimization of channel selection using cognitive heuristics.
E. Sensing & Application Layers
1) Conceptual Approaches: The paper [64] introduces Au-
tonomous Crowdsensing (ACS) as a novel paradigm that spans
sensing and application layers conceptually through founda-
tion intelligence for crowdsensing. The framework enables
fully autonomous operation by integrating professional sensing
resources (satellites, IoT nodes) and non-professional partic-
ipants through a decentralized ecosystem powered by DAOs,
LLMs, and Human-Oriented Operating Systems (HOOS).
Key innovations include the ”6A-goal” framework achieving
autonomous generation (LLM-driven task creation), growth
(iterative learning), organization (DAO governance), control
(IoT/robotic coordination), assistance (HOOS support), and
verification (AI content validation). ACS demonstrates quali-
tative improvements over traditional crowdsensing by signifi-
cantly reducing human effort, enhancing scalability through
decentralized structures, and ensuring trust via blockchain-
based verification. While the paper highlights transformative
potential for CPSS applications, it acknowledges remaining
challenges including LLM dependencies and privacy concerns
that require further research.
2) Experimental Approaches: The paper [57] proposes an
AGI-driven framework targeting the sensing and application
layers for IoT deployments. The approach integrates adaptive
mechanisms such as local analysis to minimize transmission
costs and latency, autonomous decision-making for context-
aware data collection, and a DRL-based framework to balance
routine and urgent inspections. To optimize efficiency, the
authors employ transfer learning and network pruning, which
significantly reduce computational overhead. Quantitative ex-
periments demonstrate substantial improvements: the VGG16
architecture achieves an 89% reduction in inference time and
80% reduction in memory usage, while ResNet18 attains 76%
faster inference and a 95% decrease in memory demand.
These advancements enable lightweight, adaptive IoT systems
capable of real-time operation under resource constraints.
The hybrid AI framework in [76] integrates self-supervised
learning, machine-generated ontologies, and symbolic AI to
provide real-time actionable insights across IoT applications,
spanning sensing and application layers. Experimental results
demonstrate the system’s ability to process large-scale time
series data and generate descriptive and predictive models for
use cases like networking, smart city analytics, and retail,
with state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting failure modalities
in networking scenarios. The paper [60] addresses sensing
and application layers through experimental active sensing
on edge devices. The authors present a novel smart edge
agent for active sensing that combines a YOLOv10-based
perception module with an active inference planner to enable
real-time adaptive decision-making on resource-constrained
edge devices. The proposed system features three key inno-
vations: an integrated architecture for autonomous dynamic
adjustments and entity tracking, optimized edge deployment
achieving 45 FPS perception and 4 FPS planning with minimal
parameters (1.34K), and successful real-world validation using
IoT cameras and robotic platforms. With its lightweight design
that effectively balances perception speed and adaptive control,
the solution demonstrates strong potential for surveillance and
robotics applications.

F . Network & Application Layers
1) Conceptual Approaches: The paper [67] explores the
network and application layers via a virtualization layer de-
ployed at the network edge. This conceptual work argues that
AI virtualization enhances IoT devices’ cognitive capabilities
through distributed edge intelligence. The study [35] explores
the integration of semantic communications and edge intelli-
gence across the network and application layers to address
challenges in the Internet of Senses (IoS). It demonstrates
how AI-driven semantic protocols optimize resource allocation
by dynamically prioritizing context-aware data transmission.
For instance, in the network layer, semantic-aware filtering
reduces redundant data streams by focusing on perceptually
relevant information, thereby lowering channel occupancy.
At the application layer, reinforcement learning (specifically
POMDP and Q-learning) is employed to manage carrier
aggregation under partial observability, balancing throughput
and energy efficiency. The case study reveals that intelligent
activation/deactivation of component carriers achieves near-
optimal throughput comparable to persistent carrier usage
while reducing active component carriers by up to 50%,
indirectly enhancing bandwidth utilization. The paper [70]
presents the FAPL-DM-BC framework, a secure and scalable
federated learning solution that integrates adaptive privacy
techniques, blockchain, and explainable AI for enhancing pri-
vacy and efficiency in IoV systems. This framework focuses on
privacy, security, and scalability in IoVs through a conceptual
Federated Learning (FL) framework. The design combines
Federated Adaptive Privacy-Aware Learning (FAPL), Dynamic
Masking (DM), and blockchain to dynamically adjust pri-
vacy policies, ensure tamper-proof provenance tracking, and
prevent data leakage and model poisoning. The paper [71]
discusses the conceptual framework of Space-Air-Ground In-
tegrated Networks (SAGIN), emphasizing the integration of
satellite, aerial, and terrestrial systems. The work explores
the use of AI and machine learning to support intelligent
systems management, cooperative behavior, and optimization
across SAGIN, with particular focus on dynamic interactions,
global collaboration challenges, and security considerations.
The paper [91] introduces causal reasoning as a foundational
framework for AI-native wireless networks, addressing chal-
lenges across network and application layers. The proposed
theoretical model leverages causal discovery, causal represen-
tation learning, and causal inference to enhance explainability,
reasoning, and adaptability in wireless systems. Specifically,
causal reasoning improves explainability by enabling root
cause analysis through causal graphical models (CGMs),
which provide insights into cause-and-effect relationships
within network variables. This approach is more effective than
traditional correlation-based methods, as it offers interpretable
and actionable insights into network behavior. The paper [82]
addresses both the application and network layers through the
integration of Interactive Artificial Intelligence (IAI) in next-
generation networking. At the application layer, IAI enhances
user interaction by incorporating Large Language Models
(LLMs) and multi-modal methods for intuitive, personalized
interfaces. Generative AI techniques like Generative Diffusion
Models (GDMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
optimize network design and simulate traffic for congestion
forecasting. Explicit user interactions refine AI outputs, im-
proving decision-making. At the network layer, IAI employs
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and GDMs for dynamic
traffic management, bandwidth optimization, and latency re-
duction. It also utilizes DRL and Mixture of Experts (MOE)
for intelligent resource allocation and integrates GANs and
LLMs for advanced threat detection and adaptive security.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the IAI frame-
work in optimizing network operations, while experiments
demonstrate the impact of optimal knowledge chunk sizes in
improving interaction quality and problem-solving efficiency.
2) Experimental Approaches: Authors in [92] addresses
network and application layers through an experimental Com-
mand and Control (C2) system for federated AI/ML in IoBT.
The work focuses on developing an AI/ML pipeline for
video feed processing and information exchange in IoBT
environments. The paper [93] proposes a neuro-symbolic
Explainable AI (XAI) twin framework for zero-touch IoE
management in wireless networks, integrating reasoning and
trustworthiness into decision-making across the network layer
(resource allocation, e.g., uplink/downlink rates) and applica-
tion layer (service orchestration). By combining neural net-
works (for real-time network dynamics like RSRP and SINR)
with symbolic AI (Bayesian networks for interpretability), the
framework achieves 96.26% accuracy in rate allocation and
18–44% higher trust scores than baselines (e.g., Gradient-
based bandits), ensuring reliable, self-adaptive automation.
G. All Layers
1) Conceptual Approaches: The paper [94] presents a
decentralized cognitive architecture for automotive Cyber-
Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), emphasizing auto-
nomic behavior, environmental awareness, and autonomous
resource allocation. The framework also incorporates interac-
tion with human users through extended reality modules to
enhance situational awareness, reliability, fault tolerance, and
security in connected vehicles. The paper [81] introduces a
groundbreaking vision for AGI-native wireless systems that
aims to transcend the incremental advances of conventional
6G technologies by embedding AGI directly into the network
architecture. Designed to operate holistically across all layers
of the network, the proposed framework leverages core cogni-
tive abilities—perception, reasoning, and planning—to enable
unprecedented levels of autonomy, adaptability, and resilience.
Central to this paradigm is a modular “Telecom Brain” archi-
tecture and a common-sense reasoning engine, which together
empower the network to interpret complex environments, an-
ticipate changes, and make intent-driven decisions. Key inno-
vations include autonomous healing of communication links,
real-time digital twin synchronization, and human-avatar inter-
action through abductive reasoning. This AGI-native approach
redefines the wireless design space, laying a foundational
blueprint for self-sustaining, intelligence-driven networks ca-
pable of managing the demands of future immersive and
dynamic applications. The studies in [95] presents a holistic
PREPRINT ARXIV 19
view of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) as a system-of-systems
framework, unifying distributed intelligence from edge devices
to cloud infrastructure through the convergence of AI, edge
computing, and IoT to enable advanced mobility for Electric,
Connected, Autonomous, and Shared (ECAS) vehicles. The
authors propose a 3D IoV architecture integrating AI-driven
edge processing with V2X connectivity for real-time safety
applications (e.g., cooperative collision avoidance, platoon-
ing), while leveraging digital twins (DTs), blockchain (DLT),
and AR/VR interfaces to enhance situational awareness and
trust. By federating intelligence across vehicles, roadside units,
and cloud platforms, the system optimizes resource efficiency,
reduces latency, and addresses privacy concerns, ultimately
bridging gaps in scalability, security, and interoperability for
next-gen IoV ecosystems in 5G/6G-enabled intelligent trans-
port systems (ITS). The paper [78] introduces GenAINet, a
framework for 6G wireless networks that leverages generative
AI agents and knowledge-driven communication, addressing
all layers of the network stack, from physical to applica-
tion. Designed for AI-native networks, GenAINet integrates
large language models (LLMs) into distributed architectures
to enable collective intelligence, tackling bandwidth, latency,
and security challenges. It employs semantic-native commu-
nication, where agents share semantic concepts (e.g., vector
embeddings, knowledge graphs) instead of raw data, reducing
redundancy and communication costs. Multi-modal reasoning
enhances decision-making across network layers. Two case
studies highlight GenAINet’s efficacy: In wireless device
queries, semantic knowledge transfer improved accuracy from
66% to 80% and reduced communication costs by 27.13%.
In wireless power control, agents sharing reasoning outputs
optimized power allocation faster than standalone agents.
Challenges include LLMs’ generalization limits and high com-
putational costs, while opportunities lie in hierarchical world
models and complex network applications. GenAINet offers a
comprehensive solution for efficient, intelligent 6G networks
through collaborative reasoning and semantic communication
across all layers.
2) Experimental Approaches: The paper [37] introduces
a joint sensing-communication-AI framework spanning the
sensing, network, and application layers, enhanced by AGI-
driven adaptive mechanisms. The system employs a tensor
decomposition framework to enable dual-use resource allo-
cation for simultaneous communication and sensing tasks.
It integrates a non-autoregressive multi-resolution generative
AI model with an adversarial transformer to predict miss-
ing or future environmental data, addressing dynamic inter-
ference scenarios. For seamless connectivity, a multi-agent
deep recurrent hysteretic Q-neural network optimizes handover
policies by learning from distributed environmental feedback.
These mechanisms collectively enhance adaptability through
resource optimization, environmental forecasting, and han-
dover efficiency, achieving 61% improved reliability in tera-
hertz wireless systems under high interference. The framework
demonstrates self-optimization capabilities by balancing real-
time decision-making with long-term learning, enabling robust
performance in unstable spectral environments. The paper [30]
spans the sensing, network, and application layers by lever-
aging a hierarchical meta-learning framework (CADSS-ML)
for IoT decision support. The study employs Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile algorithms for rapid task
adaptation, along with reinforcement learning for reasoning,
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms
for dynamic contextual adaptation, and federated learning
for privacy-preserving distributed learning. The framework
enables effective decision-making across IoT systems by com-
bining multimodal data fusion and context-aware reasoning.
Experimental trials demonstrate a 20% improvement in pre-
diction accuracy, a 15% enhancement in decision reliability,
and a 12% increase in resource utilization efficiency. The
study highlights the integration of advanced techniques such as
CNNs, transformers, and GNNs, improving adaptability, pre-
cision, and privacy across diverse IoT applications, including
precision farming, autonomous navigation, and smart irriga-
tion. The paper [96] proposes a context-aware, policy-driven
(CAPD) framework for the IoBT, integrating sensing, network,
and application layers through ontology-based reasoning and
knowledge graphs. The framework enhances resilience in con-
tested electromagnetic environments by dynamically adapting
to constraints such as bandwidth limitations and adversarial
attacks. For example, it adjusts video transmission formats,
switches communication technologies (e.g., 4G to LoRaW AN)
under jamming, and transitions from video to audio data
when cameras are compromised. While the paper demonstrates
adaptive capabilities through use cases like drone repositioning
and dynamic resource allocation, it does not provide quantita-
tive performance metrics or address learning/self-optimization.
Future work focuses on mitigating sensor data poisoning and
improving truth-maintenance capabilities.
VI. AGI-D RIVEN LAYER -SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS
The layered architecture of IoX systems—comprising sens-
ing, network, and application layers—faces distinct bottle-
necks, such as data overload, protocol heterogeneity, and
identity explosion, as detailed in Section II. Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) offers targeted solutions to these challenges
by leveraging advanced reasoning, adaptability, and context-
awareness, surpassing the limitations of Narrow AI (Section
IV-D). Table III summarizes key AGI-enabled optimizations
for each layer, drawing from recent studies. For example, at
the sensing layer, neuro-symbolic machine learning enhances
feature extraction in noisy environments [31], while network-
layer semantic communications reduce latency in bandwidth-
constrained systems [35]. At the application layer, large lan-
guage models (LLMs) enable context-aware decision-making
for urban IoT [33]. These solutions address critical IoX
bottlenecks, improving efficiency, reliability, and scalability.
Table III highlights several high-impact AGI solutions. In
the sensing layer, active inference enables real-time adaptive
sensing on resource-constrained edge devices, reducing per-
ception latency by up to 50% [60]. However, implementing
complex reasoning on such devices remains challenging due
to computational limitations. In the network layer, multi-
agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) combined with
federated learning improves throughput by 25% while pre-
serving privacy [66], though coordinating distributed learning
PREPRINT ARXIV 20
across nodes poses synchronization challenges. At the appli-
cation layer, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances
autonomous driving systems by mitigating hallucination risks
[38], but ensuring safety in critical applications requires robust
validation. These examples, grounded in the taxonomy of
Figure 5, illustrate AGI’s role in addressing layer-specific
bottlenecks while highlighting implementation trade-offs that
warrant further research.
A. Sensing Layer
The sensing layer in IoX systems is responsible for data
acquisition from the physical world, yet it faces challenges like
data overload, energy constraints, and the need for adaptive
processing. AGI provides innovative solutions, as outlined in
Table III.
1) Data Overload: To address data overload, AGI employs
unsupervised learning for multi-modal feature detection and
tensor decomposition for parameter extraction. Unsupervised
learning abstracts features from heterogeneous sensor data
without pre-programmed labeling, reducing processing de-
mands. Tensor decomposition handles high-dimensional data
in real-time, improving sensing accuracy and efficiency [29].
2) Energy Constraints: Transfer learning and pruning op-
timize models for resource-constrained IoT devices, reducing
inference time and memory usage. Studies show these tech-
niques can cut inference time by up to 89% [57], making AGI
viable for energy-limited environments. Additionally, selective
sensing frameworks, inspired by attention mechanisms, allevi-
ate data overload by improving physical-cyber mapping, thus
enhancing real-time responsiveness in IoX systems [97].
3) Adaptive Sensor Fusion: Neuro-symbolic machine
learning enhances feature extraction and data fusion by in-
tegrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning, improving
robustness in noisy conditions [31].
4) Edge Preprocessing: Active inference enables on-device
perception, reducing perception latency by up to 50% [60].
However, its computational complexity poses implementation
challenges on edge devices.
5) Selective Attention Mechanisms: Active inference and
neuro-symbolic approaches inherently prioritize relevant sen-
sory inputs, optimizing resource use and enhancing system
efficiency.
B. Network Layer
The network layer manages data transmission and commu-
nication, facing issues like protocol heterogeneity and the need
for secure, scalable solutions. AGI techniques from Table III
address these challenges.
1) Protocol Heterogeneity: Semantic communications de-
velop efficient encoding schemes that focus on data meaning,
reducing latency and improving interoperability across diverse
protocols [35]. Furthermore, data semantization in IoT enables
semantic modeling and communication, playing a vital role in
enhancing network and application layers in IoX systems [98].
2) Dynamic Spectrum Management: Causal reasoning in-
tegrates causal models into network protocols, enhancing
adaptability and resilience to changing conditions [91].
3) Secure and Scalable Communication: MAPPO with
federated learning improves throughput by 25% while pre-
serving privacy [66]. Neuro-symbolic Explainable AI ensures
trustworthy network management [93], though coordinating
distributed learning remains a challenge.
C. Application Layer
The application layer handles high-level decision-making
and user interactions, grappling with identity management
and real-time processing needs. AGI solutions enhance these
capabilities.
1) Identity/Relationship Management: LLMs and agent-
based foundation models provide contextual understanding
for managing complex identities and relationships in large-
scale IoX systems [33]. Moreover, integrating artificial social
intelligence with IoT-enabled social relationships addresses
application-layer challenges, such as identity and relationship
management, in CPST ecosystems [99].
2) Real-time, Context-aware Decision Making: Active in-
ference, RAG, and GPT-in-the-loop enhance decision-making.
RAG mitigates hallucination risks in autonomous systems
[38], while GPT-in-the-loop boosts adaptability in multiagent
setups [77].
3) Semantic Modeling: LLMs excel in creating semantic
models that capture complex relationships, supporting intelli-
gent decision-making [33].
4) Knowledge Graphs: Agent-based foundation models and
LLMs dynamically build knowledge graphs, extracting entities
and relationships for advanced reasoning and decision support.
VII. C ROSS -LAYER INTEGRATION
While layer-specific AGI optimizations address isolated
bottlenecks, the interconnected nature of IoX systems neces-
sitates cross-layer integration to achieve systemic efficiency
and adaptability in Cyber-Physical-Social-Thinking (CPST)
ecosystems. Section II highlighted how bottlenecks, such
as sensing inaccuracies or network latency, cascade across
layers, amplifying systemic inefficiencies. Cross-layer strate-
gies leverage AGI’s cross-domain reasoning to unify sens-
ing, networking, and application functionalities, as cataloged
in Table IV. For instance, joint sensing-communication-AI
frameworks optimize spectral efficiency in terahertz networks
[37], while federated learning with blockchain ensures privacy
in vehicular IoX systems [70]. These approaches, aligned with
the architectural paradigms in Figure 5, enable holistic opti-
mization critical for smart cities, healthcare, and autonomous
systems.
A. Importance of Cross-Layer Coordination
In IoX systems, the sensing, network, and application layers
are deeply interdependent, with the performance of one layer
directly impacting the others. For example, excessive data
generation at the sensing layer, driven by high-resolution
sensors or dense device deployments, can overwhelm network
bandwidth, leading to congestion and increased latency. This,
in turn, hampers the application layer’s ability to deliver

real-time, context-aware decisions, critical for applications
like autonomous vehicles or smart healthcare systems. Tra-
ditional layer-specific optimization approaches, such as en-
hancing sensing accuracy in isolation, often fail to mitigate
these cascading effects, as improvements in one layer may
exacerbate bottlenecks in another example, higher sensing
fidelity increasing data transmission demands beyond network
capacity. Cross-layer coordination addresses these systemic
challenges by ensuring that optimizations are harmonized
across layers, preventing isolated enhancements from creat-
ing new inefficiencies elsewhere. Studies demonstrate that
such coordination can yield significant performance gains;
for instance, cross-layer energy optimization has achieved up
to 52.88% improvement in energy consumption and 51.53%
reduction in latency [54]. By leveraging AGI’s ability to model
complex interdependencies and adapt dynamically, cross-layer
coordination enhances overall system efficiency, reliability,
and scalability, making it indispensable for next-generation
IoX deployments in CPST ecosystems.
B. Strategies for Cross-Layer Integration
Cross-layer integration strategies harness AGI’s advanced
reasoning and adaptability to unify IoX layers, tackling sys-
temic bottlenecks like data overload, protocol heterogeneity,
and computational constraints. For instance, aggregating infor-
mation from distributed data nodes in industrial IoX systems
enhances cross-layer efficiency by addressing bottlenecks such
as data overload and communication latency [100], with AGI’s
cross-domain reasoning supporting these integrated architec-
tures. This subsection explores four key strategies—Joint Sens-
ing, Communication, and AI Frameworks; Federated Learning
with Blockchain; Meta-Learning for Resource Management;
and Active Inference for System Optimization—detailing their
mechanisms, benefits, and challenges, with references to Ta-
ble IV and relevant studies.
1) Joint Sensing, Communication, and AI Frameworks:
Joint Sensing, Communication, and AI Frameworks integrate
sensing, communication, and computational processes into a
cohesive system, leveraging AGI to optimize resource use and
performance across IoX layers. These frameworks employ AI
to dynamically adjust sensing parameters (e.g., sampling rates)
and communication protocols (e.g., bandwidth allocation)
based on real-time system states and environmental feedback.
For instance, in a smart city context, AI can prioritize data
from traffic sensors during peak hours, adjusting network
resources to ensure timely delivery to the application layer for
PREPRINT ARXIV 22
traffic management. A notable implementation by Chaccour
et al. [37] uses tensor decomposition and generative AI to
enable dual-use resource allocation in terahertz networks,
achieving a 61% improvement in reliability under high in-
terference. Benefits include enhanced spectral efficiency and
improved extended reality experiences, critical for immersive
IoX applications. However, these frameworks demand high-
performance edge computing and advanced signal processing,
and coordinating multiple subsystems introduces significant
complexity, posing challenges for real-time deployment in
resource-constrained settings.
2) Federated Learning with Blockchain: Federated Learn-
ing with Blockchain combines decentralized machine learn-
ing with blockchain technology to enable secure, privacy-
preserving collaboration across IoX devices, integrating net-
work and application layers. In this approach, devices train
local models on private data and share only model updates,
which are aggregated to refine a global model without ex-
posing sensitive information. Blockchain ensures the integrity
and traceability of these updates, enhancing trust in distributed
systems. Similarly, distributed video analytics architectures
leverage edge computing and federated learning to optimize
data processing and privacy across sensing, network, and ap-
plication layers [101], aligning with the emphasis on federated
learning with blockchain. For example, in healthcare IoX sys-
tems, this strategy allows collaborative training of diagnostic
models across hospitals while safeguarding patient privacy.
Sathwik et al. [70] demonstrate its efficacy in the Internet of
Vehicles (IoVs), reducing data leakage by 70% through adap-
tive differential privacy and blockchain. Key benefits include
enhanced privacy and scalability, as it eliminates centralized
data storage and supports large-scale device networks. How-
ever, it requires robust distributed computing infrastructure and
secure communication protocols, and blockchain’s consensus
mechanisms can introduce performance overhead, limiting its
efficiency in latency-sensitive applications.
3) Meta-Learning for Resource Management: Meta-
Learning for Resource Management utilizes meta-learning
techniques to enable rapid adaptation of resource allocation
strategies across IoX layers, addressing dynamic demands in
sensing, network, and application contexts. By learning from
prior tasks, the system generalizes strategies to new scenarios,
such as adjusting network bandwidth or sensing frequency in
response to fluctuating loads. This is particularly valuable in
autonomous vehicle networks, where resource needs vary with
traffic conditions. Hassan et al. [30] propose a hierarchical
meta-learning framework (CADSS-ML) that integrates Model-
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and reinforcement learning,
achieving a 12% increase in resource utilization efficiency
and a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy across IoT
applications like smart irrigation. Benefits include rapid task
adaptation and optimized resource use, enhancing system re-
sponsiveness. However, meta-learning requires flexible neural
network architectures and efficient optimization algorithms,
and its computational complexity can lead to instability in
resource-constrained environments, necessitating careful de-
sign trade-offs.
4) Active Inference for System Optimization: Active Infer-
ence for System Optimization applies active inference prin-
ciples—a framework from neuroscience and machine learn-
ing—to proactively manage IoX system behavior across all
layers. This strategy enables systems to predict future states
and take actions to confirm or adjust those predictions, opti-
mizing perception, learning, and decision-making. In industrial
IoX settings, active inference can predict equipment failures
and preemptively schedule maintenance, reducing downtime.
Friston et al. [32] propose it as a unified “physics of in-
telligence” for adaptive ecosystems, with experimental val-
idation showing a 50% reduction in perception latency on
edge devices [60]. Benefits include a cohesive optimization
framework that enhances system adaptability and efficiency.
However, it demands sophisticated probabilistic modeling and
a hierarchical architecture, and scaling to large, complex
systems poses significant computational challenges, limiting
its practicality without substantial infrastructure support.
In summary, these strategies collectively address IoX bottle-
necks by fostering seamless coordination across layers, lever-
aging AGI’s capabilities to enhance efficiency, privacy, and
adaptability. While they offer transformative potential, their
implementation challenges—such as computational demands
and scalability—highlight the need for ongoing research, as
discussed in Section VII.
Table IV illustrates how AGI-driven cross-layer strategies
unify IoX layers to address systemic bottlenecks, enhancing
efficiency and adaptability in CPST ecosystems. Solutions
like joint sensing-communication-AI frameworks and active
inference, validated by works such as [32, 37], highlight AGI’s
potential for holistic optimization. Yet, scalability and com-
putational complexity remain critical hurdles, necessitating
further exploration as outlined in Section VII.

IX. C ONCLUSION
This survey has systematically explored the transformative
potential of integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
into the IoX to address critical bottlenecks in Cyber-Physical-
Social-Thinking (CPST) ecosystems across sensing, network,
and application layers. By synthesizing a wide range of AGI-
driven architectural frameworks—spanning neuro-symbolic
hybrids and active inference models at the sensing layer,
semantic protocols and federated learning at the network
layer, and generative AI with multi-agent reasoning at the
application layer—we have demonstrated that AGI provides a
robust foundation for achieving real-time adaptability, cross-
domain reasoning, and context-aware decision-making. Hybrid
human-artificial intelligence, as exemplified in autonomous
driving, demonstrates AGI’s transformative potential in real-
world IoX applications by enabling advanced reasoning and
decision-making in dynamic environments. These capabili-
ties significantly surpass the limitations of traditional nar-
row AI, enabling IoX systems to navigate the complexities
of interconnected physical, digital, social, and cognitive di-
mensions. Our analysis reveals that AGI-enabled solutions
effectively mitigate sensing-layer challenges, such as data
overload and heterogeneous sensor fusion, through adaptive
learning, selective attention, and edge preprocessing. In the
network layer, joint sensing-communication-AI frameworks,
blockchain-assisted federated learning, and dynamic spectrum
management enhance reliability, bandwidth efficiency, and
secure data handling. At the application layer, large-scale
language models, structured knowledge representations, and
collaborative multi-agent systems drive semantic understand-
ing, autonomous orchestration, and scalable decision-making,
with applications in smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation.Moreover, identity modeling and ad-
dressing in IoT are crucial for managing the identity explosion
in IoX application layers, with AGI-driven solutions like large
language models offering significant advantages, thereby rein-
forcing the survey’s conclusions on AGI’s role in intelligent
ecosystems. These advancements collectively position AGI-
enhanced IoX as a cornerstone for next-generation intelligent
systems. Despite these strides, significant challenges persist.
Balancing computational demands between edge and cloud
infrastructures remains critical to address latency, energy con-
sumption, and resource constraints. Privacy, security, and trust
mechanisms must be seamlessly integrated into AGI pipelines
to safeguard sensitive data and counter adversarial threats. The
lack of large-scale, real-world validation for many proposed
architectures raises concerns about scalability and robustness
in diverse operational contexts. Moreover, the computational
intensity of AGI models necessitates advancements in efficient
algorithms, model compression, and hardware accelerators to
ensure feasibility on resource-constrained devices. Looking
ahead, several research priorities emerge to unlock the full po-
tential of AGI-enhanced IoX. Standardized integration frame-
works and interoperable toolkits are essential to streamline
AGI adoption across heterogeneous IoX platforms. Innova-
tions in adaptive resource scheduling, lightweight inference
engines, and quantum-enabled communication hold promise
for overcoming computational and connectivity barriers. Eth-
ical governance frameworks, emphasizing transparency, fair-
ness, and accountability, must evolve alongside technical ad-
vancements to ensure responsible deployment. Rigorous field
trials and cross-disciplinary collaborations will be pivotal in
validating theoretical benefits and translating them into tangi-
ble operational impact. In summary, AGI-enhanced IoX rep-
resents a paradigm-shifting frontier at the nexus of intercon-
nected systems and advanced AI. By addressing bottlenecks
across sensing, network, and application layers, AGI paves the
way for adaptive, resilient, and intelligent CPST ecosystems.
While challenges in scalability, efficiency, and ethical align-
ment remain, sustained research, standardized practices, and
interdisciplinary efforts will be crucial in realizing this vision.
The evolution of AGI-enhanced IoX promises to redefine the
capabilities of cyber-physical-social systems, fostering a future
where intelligent networks seamlessly integrate physical, dig-
ital, and cognitive interactions for societal and technological
advancement.
