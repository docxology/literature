ABSTRACT
We propose a formal foundation for cognition rooted in algebraic topology, built on a Homological Parity Principle. This posits
that even-dimensional homology (Heven) represents stable Structure/Context (e.g., generative models), while odd-dimensional
homology (Hodd) represents dynamic Flow/Content (e.g., sensory/memory data). Cognition is governed by the Context-Content
Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a dynamical cycle aligning these parities. This framework distinguishes two modes: Inference
(waking), where the Heven scaffold predicts the Hodd flow (a Context-before-Content process); and Learning (sleep), an
inverted Structure-before-Specificity process where Hodd memory traces sculpt the Heven scaffold. This parity interpretation
unifies cognitive functions like semantic (Heven) and episodic (Hodd) memory and provides a structural generalization of existing
theories, recasting Friston’s Free Energy Principle and Tonini’s Integrated Information in topological terms.
Grand unified theories of cognition, such as the Free Energy Principle (FEP) 1 or Integrated Information Theory (IIT)2,
seek fundamental principles of perception and consciousness. While FEP describes thedynamicsof inference (minimizing
surprisal) and IIT quantifies thecapacityfor consciousness (a scalar, Φ), neither fully describes the underlyingstructure
of the representational space itself. We propose this missing foundation is topological, and that its organization follows a
fundamental parity-based principle derived from the Euler characteristic, χ. The foundational axiom of algebraic topology,
∂2 =0 (the boundary of a boundary is nil)3, ensures that homology groups (βk =dimH k) are well-defined and gives rise to the
Euler-Poincaré formula, χ= ∑k(−1)kβk4, 5. We propose a physical interpretation of this invariant based on its decomposition
by parity: χ= (∑β2k)−( ∑β2k+1), or χ=H even −Hodd. This Heven −Hodd formulation provides the central motivation for our
homological framework.
We identify the even-dimensional Heven with the stable, scaffold of a cognitive system, representing the generativeworld
model6, 7 and its associated semantic knowledge 8. Conversely, we identify the odd-dimensional Hodd with the dynamic,
flow of internal processes, representing thelatent self(e.g., episodic traces 9, active inference10). The Euler characteristic,
χ=H even −Hodd, is recast as a measure of the topologicalimbalancebetween the agent’s world-model Heven (context/scaffold)
and its internal, self-representational flow Hodd (content). The convergence of the context-content alignment cycleisthe process
of minimizing this imbalance. This reformulation provides a topological basis for FEP1, suggesting a self-organizing system
maintains its integrity by driving the system towards a state of global coherence where χ≈0 , which we define as being
topologically self-consistent.
We posit that cognition is a dynamical cycle, obeying the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP)11, that seeks to
align these parities through two primary modes (Fig. 1)12. The first isinference(waking), a context-before-content cycle where
the Heven scaffold provides top-down predictions to constrain the Hodd flow. This directly formalizes hierarchical Bayesian
inference13, with perception as the convergence of the cycle, where the Hodd flow “snaps” to the nearest low-energy state on the
Heven scaffold. The second mode islearning(sleep) 14, an inverted Structure-before-Specificity (SbS) process. With external
sensory noise absent, Hodd content, dominated by replayed episodic memory traces15, provides training data to anneal the Heven
scaffold. We can abstract the consolidation mechanism16 of the learning mode by the following homological memory model.
Let γi denote the i-th memory trace (an Hodd flow); it is decomposed as: γi =σ+ ∑k aik βk +∂d i, where σ∈Z k is the context
backbone (Heven scaffold) common to multiple traces; βk are the independent recurrent content loops (Hodd episodic flow);
and ∂di is the residual boundary representing transient, unbound noise or surprisal. The SbS learning process is a boundary
evolution that minimizes this noise (∂di →0 ), leaving the stable memory manifold σ+ ∑k aikβk and thereby refining the Heven
scaffold (σ).
The proposed homological memory model elegantly explains several core dissociations in cognition. The distinction between
stable semantic memory (Heven) and dynamic episodic memory (Hodd)9 becomes a foundational feature of the architecture.
Likewise, it maps the rules of syntax (Heven scaffold) to the flow of meaning (Hodd process), providing a topological basis for
semantic bootstrapping17. In social cognition, it separates the Heven scaffold (Cognitive Theory of Mind) from the Hodd flow

The Homological Parity Principle
The principle posits a fundamental dichotomy in cognitive topology.Even-dimensional homology ( Heven), such
as components (β0) and cavities (β2), represents the stable, time-invariantscaffold, structure, or contextof a
system (e.g., a generative model, semantic rules). Conversely,Odd-dimensional homology ( Hodd), such as cycles
(β1) and voids (β3), represents the dynamic, time-varyingflow, process, or contentthat unfolds upon that structure
(e.g., a sensory stream, an episodic memory, a conscious thought).

flows onto their supporting scaffolds.

Our topological framework also provides a structural generalization of existing theories 2. It recasts consciousness not
as a scalar (Φ) but as a topological signature of parity balance. A system’s integrated information can be reformulated as
ΦTopo =C H −|χ| , where CH = ∑k βk is the total topological richness and χ is the Euler characteristic. This value is maximized
only when the system has both rich homology (high CH ) and global coherence (low |χ|)19, meaning its Heven scaffold and Hodd
flow are equally balanced. This model also complements FEP1 by defining the verylandscapeupon which active inference
unfolds: FEP describes the Hodd flow of beliefs descending a gradient, while homology describes the Heven structure of the
generative model that creates the gradient. In short, this topological parity principle offers a unifying foundation, linking the
geometry of mental models to the dynamics of learning, memory, and perception20.
We propose a plausible neurological substrate for the advocated parity principle. The stable Heven scaffold corresponds to
the brain’s anatomical and slow-changing functional connectome, the synaptic-weighted architecture of cortical columns that
encode the generative model21. The dynamic Hodd flow, in contrast, corresponds to the transient, high-frequency process of
neural activity, such as the phase-locked cycles of theta-gamma oscillations22 that run on that scaffold12, 20. This maps directly
to the homological memory model: a “flash of insight” or “Aha!” moment is the emergence of a new, persistentHodd oscillatory
pattern (σi) that is not yet supported by the underlying Heven scaffold. The subsequent SbS learning process (i.e., sleep14) is the
synaptic plasticity (LTP) that physically hardens this new Hodd cycle into the Heven connectome, updating the world model by
making the novel insightful (σi) part of the stable known basis (βj).
Finally, the proposed scaffold-flow model generates specific, falsifiable predictions for both healthy and pathological
cognition. We predict that a state of high free energy (i.e., high surprisal) will correspond to a high degree of topological
imbalance (|χ| ≫0). This suggests a novel class of topological biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. For example, disorders of
psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia), often framed as a failure of priors where the generative model fails to constrain sensory flow23,
would be characterized by a chaotic state where Hodd ≫H even, resulting in a large negative Euler characteristic. Conversely,
disorders of rigidity (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder 24), often framed as overly-precise priors that are resistant to sensory
updating25, would be characterized by a rigid state where Heven ≫H odd, resulting in a large positive Euler characteristic. This
framework also suggests new avenues for AI, framing catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a failure
to build a stable Heven scaffold, and proposing that a sleep-wake cycle26 that uses the homological memory model for offline
consolidation could resolve it. We conclude that this dual-mode architecture, which uses a sleep phase (Hodd flow) to anneal its
waking scaffold (Heven), is not a quirk of biological cognition but a necessary topological foundation for any system, artificial
or natural, to achieve generalizable intelligence27.
