ABSTRACT
In this paper, we develop further the theory of thermostated systems along the lines
of our earlier paper ([1] Fox). Two results are highlighted: 1) in the Markov limit of the
contracted description, a least dissipation of Helmholtz free energy principle is
established; and 2) a detailed account of the appropriateness of this principle for nano-
biology, including the evolution of life, is presented.
Introduction
In ([1] Fox), hereafter referred to as TSI, we referred to the extensive work done
over the past 25 years on thermostated systems. In some of that work computer
simulations were performed and it was often the case that the trajectory was stopped
suddenly and then instantaneously all momenta were reversed and the reversed trajectory
was followed and compared with the original trajectory. Rather elegant theoretical results
were achieved from this perspective, including, among others, the Jarzynski equality and
the Crooks theorem (for references, see TSI). In TSI we noted that these instantaneous
momentum reversals of each and every particle are physically impossible to achieve in
the laboratory. Instead of following that approach we sought an approach in which all
concepts are realizable physically. We stated that from the perspective of nano-biology
applications, the major constituent of these systems is water that acts as an interstitial
thermal reservoir with high heat capacity and strong heat conductivity. A nano-biological
system can be looked at instead as comprised of all of its solute molecules with the water
molecules producing Brownian motion on the solute molecules but otherwise the water
molecules are not explicitly represented. In nano-biology we typically have very low
Reynolds number and viscosity overwhelms inertia ([2] Fox, [3] Berg). We call such
systems strongly over-damped. In a second step in TSI we contracted the description by
integrating out all of the solute momenta. This is an objective procedure, free of
subjective coarse graining. The resulting contracted description describes the spatial
evolution of the solute molecules in the form of a non-Markov evolution equation, given
by equation (43) of TSI. Two techniques were used to achieve the contraction, projection
operators and boson operator representations ([4] Steiger and Fox, [5] Fox). The resulting
description captures what we actually see, spatially, and not the unseen underlying
momenta dependent Hamiltonian dynamics.
The strongly over-damped case permits a further reduction of the description that
was used in TSI to obtain the Markov approximation given by equation (125) of TSI.
This Markov version of the contracted description is the focus of the present paper. In
section I the explicit generalization to 𝑛 interacting solute particles, each in 3 spatial
dimensions, is given. The proof that the macroscopic Helmholtz free energy, 𝐹, is
monotonically decreasing is made explicit for this generalization. In section II we prove a
new result for these systems. We show how to use the conditional probability solution,
𝑃 , for the Markov limit of the contracted description to construct microscopic paths in
!
solute coordinate space that are reminiscent of the time reversible phase space trajectories
used in the earlier research of others. 𝑃 is the Green’s function solution to the Markov
!
limit of the contracted description. Using the Trotter Product formula, together with the
Dirac delta function Green’s function for a simultaneously first order in time and first
order in space partial differential equation, we obtain an explicit rendering of the
probability of a microscopic path in the strongly over-damped regime. This enables us to
establish that the microscopic Helmholtz free energy dissipation for the most probable
path is least compared to all other paths starting from the same initial point.
Section III is dedicated to interpreting these results in the context of nano-biology.
We begin by looking at the details for ubiquinone, a fundamental component of electron
transport chains. With it we can assess the sizes of ∆𝑡 and 𝑑𝑟 as well as the conditions for
the Markov limit of the contracted description. For example, ∆𝑡 needs to be small enough
for validity of the Trotter Product formula and simultaneously large enough for the
Markov limit. A number of questions may be asked about the contemporary structure of
cells and of their metabolic pathways in light of the least dissipation principle. One may
well ask: Why is energy metabolism, based on the oxidation of sugar (glucose) by
oxygen, broken up into many small steps that harvest the available free energy in small
useful packets of energy in the form of ATP? Why not simply burn sugar with a flame
and get the decrease of free energy and the approach to full equilibrium over with
rapidly? Another issue is: What happens to the ATP? It could simply hydrolyze and turn
its energy into heat, reaching full equilibrium quickly. Instead it activates a host of other
molecules so that they in turn can react or change conformation. Principal among the
activated species are amino acids activated for condensation into proteins instead of
simple hydrolysis of the ATP or of the activated monomers, the amino-acyl-adenylates.
Similarly for the polymerization of mononucleotides into polynucleotides, such as RNA
and DNA, the monomers initially are activated by ATP. Why does DNA get replicated or
transcribed using activated monomers instead of these activated nucleotides and the DNA
simply hydrolyzing instead? We can also ask why proteins produced in the cell self-
assemble into complexes instead of hydrolyzing first. These are a few of the examples
that become elucidated through application of the least dissipation of free energy
principle.
I. Monotonic decrease of the macroscopic Helmholtz free energy
In TSI the presentation was given in one spatial dimension in order to make the
presentation as transparent as possible. We now expand the description to include 𝑛
interacting particles, each in 3 spatial dimensions. Sections IX and X of TSI are the
relevant sections. The macroscopic Helmholtz free energy, 𝐹, is defined by
(1)
𝐹 = 𝐸 − 𝑇𝑆
in which 𝑇 is the thermostat temperature, 𝐸 is the internal energy and 𝑆 is the entropy.
For the particle labeled by 𝑗 the coordinates are given by 𝒓 . The 𝑛 particle distribution
𝒋
function at time 𝑡 is written as 𝑅 𝒓 ,𝒓 ,…,𝒓 ,𝑡 . The potential energy, previously
𝟏 𝟐 𝒏
simply denoted by 𝑈, will now be given by
(2)
! !
1
𝑈 = 𝑈 + 𝑈
! !"
2
!!! !,!!!
in which the 𝑈 ′𝑠 are one particle potentials that include the walls of the container, and
!
the 𝑈 ′𝑠 are two particle interaction potentials. The factor of ½ corrects for double
!"
counting the pair potentials. Inclusion of multi-particle potentials for 3 or more particles
is not excluded in principle, and is indeed necessary if one is to model reactions and
catalysis purely classically, without help from quantum mechanics. Given these
preliminaries, the internal energy in equation (1) is given by
(3)
! !

𝐸 = 𝑑𝒓 𝑑𝒓 …𝑑𝒓 𝑈 + 𝑈 𝑅 𝒓 ,𝒓 ,…,𝒓 ,𝑡
𝟏 𝟐 𝒏 ! !" 𝟏 𝟐 𝒏

in which the differentials are meant to denote differential volumes: 𝑑𝒓 = 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦𝑑𝑧. The
entropy, 𝑆, is given by
(4)
𝑆 = −𝑘 𝑑𝒓 𝑑𝒓 …𝑑𝒓 𝑅 𝒓 ,𝒓 ,…,𝒓 ,𝑡 𝑙𝑛 𝑅 𝒓 ,𝒓 ,…,𝒓 ,𝑡
! 𝟏 𝟐 𝒏 𝟏 𝟐 𝒏 𝟏 𝟐 𝒏
The argument of the logarithm term could also contain a constant factor with the units of
volume to the 𝑛!! power to compensate the units of 𝑅 and make the argument a
dimensionless number but this constant factor will not show up in later results. The
equation governing the time evolution of 𝑅 is a generalization of the Markov equation
(125) in TSI. Equations (120−124) of TSI explain how the Markov approximation is
obtained. Instead of just a single diffusion constant, 𝐷 , each particle may have its own
!
value of 𝐷 although identical particles would normally have identical values of 𝐷. The 𝑛
!
particle equation is
(5)
!
𝜕 𝑅 = 𝐷 𝛁 ∙ 𝛁 + 𝛽𝛁 𝑈 𝑅
! ! ! ! !
!!!
where we have suppressed explicit spatial variable dependence and 𝛽 = 1/𝑘 𝑇. In
!
equation (126) of TSI the proof of monotonicity used integration by parts for one
variable. We will now need to treat 3𝑛 variables using a 3𝑛 dimensional generalization of
the divergence theorem of 3𝑑 vector calculus. The proof takes the form:
(6)
𝑑 𝐹 = 𝑑!!𝑟 𝑈 + 𝑘 𝑇 𝑙𝑛 𝑅 𝜕 𝑅
! ! !
in which a term on the right hand side integrated to zero because 𝑅 is normalized (and
𝑑!!𝑟 is shorthand for 𝑑𝒓 𝑑𝒓 …𝑑𝒓 ). Substitute equation (5) into the right hand side
𝟏 𝟐 𝒏
(7)

𝑑 𝐹 = 𝑑!!𝑟 𝑈 + 𝑘 𝑇 𝑙𝑛 𝑅 𝐷 𝛁 ∙ 𝛁 + 𝛽𝛁 𝑈 𝑅

It is clear that the decrease vanishes at full equilibrium when
(8)

𝑅 = exp −𝛽𝑈
𝑄
in which 𝑄 is the normalization factor 𝑄 = 𝑑!!𝑟exp −𝛽𝑈 𝒓 ,𝒓 ,…,𝒓 for the 𝑈 in
𝟏 𝟐 𝒏
equation (2).
It is seen here that the Markov approximation to the contraction of the description
elucidated in TSI depicts a system of 𝑛 coupled, interacting, diffusing particles. In the
highly over-damped, very low Reynolds number, situation that this represents, non-
equilibrium thermodynamics remains valid far from full equilibrium and is governed by
the Helmholtz free energy which monotonically decreases with time if no outside forces
or energy/matter fluxes are operating. One context in which this is an especially apt
description is nano-biology as will be shown in section III.
II. Least dissipation of Helmholtz free energy
In order to make the presentation as transparent as possible, we will again revert to
one dimension. The Markov limit of the contracted description is given by equation (125)
of TSI
(9)
1
𝜕 𝑅 𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜕 𝜕 + 𝛽𝑈! 𝑅 𝑟,𝑡
! ! !
𝛼𝛽
The coefficient in the front of the right hand side is Einstein’s formula for the diffusion
constant, 𝐷. The solution with initial condition
(10)
𝑅 𝑟,0 = 𝛿(𝑟 − 𝑟 )
!
is called 𝑃 (𝑟,𝑟 ,𝑡), the conditional probability density. If at time 𝑡 = 0 the particle is at
! !
𝑟 then the probability that it will be between 𝑟 and 𝑟 + 𝑑𝑟 at time 𝑡 is 𝑑𝑟×𝑃 (𝑟,𝑟 ,𝑡).
! ! !
This means that 𝑃 (𝑟,𝑟 ,𝑡) is also the Green’s function for
! !
(12)
𝜕 𝑅 𝑟,𝑡 = 𝐷𝜕 𝜕 + 𝛽𝑈! 𝑅 𝑟,𝑡
! ! !
where now the diffusion constant is made explicit. The formal solution to this equation is
(13)
𝑅 𝑟,𝑡 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝑡𝐷𝜕 𝜕 + 𝛽𝑈! 𝛿(𝑟 − 𝑟 )
! ! !
This isn’t as useful as it appears because the two pieces of the exponentiated differential
operator do not commute:
(14)
𝐷𝜕!,𝐷𝜕 𝛽𝑈! ≠ 0
! !
We may get around this problem using the idea of the Trotter Product formula that states
(15)
𝑡 𝑡 !
𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝑡𝐷𝜕 𝜕 + 𝛽𝑈! = lim 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝐷𝜕! 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝛽𝐷𝜕 𝑈!
! ! ! !
!→! 𝑛 𝑛
!
We will denote by ∆𝑡 and imagine that it is very small (but not as small as the intrinsic
!
relaxation time for the non-Markov description). Now introduce the Markov property that
allows us to write
(16)
!!!
𝑑𝑟 ×𝑃 𝑟 ,𝑟 ,𝑡;𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ = 𝑑𝑟 ×𝑃 𝑟 ,𝑟,∆𝑡
! ! ! ! !!! ! !!! !
!!!
for 𝑡 = 𝑛∆𝑡. This means that the probability that the particle starts at 𝑟 at 𝑡 = 0 and ends
!
up in the interval between 𝑟 and 𝑟 + 𝑑𝑟 at time 𝑡 having taken a particular path is
! ! !
given by the left hand side, whereas the right hand side says that the particle starts at 𝑟 at
!
𝑡 = 0 and at time ∆𝑡 has probability 𝑑𝑟 ×𝑃 (𝑟 ,𝑟 ,∆𝑡) to be in the interval between 𝑟
! ! ! ! !
and 𝑟 + 𝑑𝑟 , and if at 𝑟 in this same spatial interval at time ∆𝑡 has probability
! ! !
𝑑𝑟 ×𝑃 (𝑟 ,𝑟 ,∆𝑡) to be in the interval between 𝑟 and 𝑟 + 𝑑𝑟 at time 2∆𝑡, et cetera.
! ! ! ! ! ! !
The sequence of 𝑟′𝑠 determines the particular path, and the width of the path is
!
determined by the sequence of 𝑑𝑟′𝑠. We may choose the widths to be identical at each
!
point and think of the path as a “tube” of very similar paths. This converts the probability
densities into probabilities. Each factor on the right hand side of equation (16)
corresponds to a factor in the Trotter Product formula
(17)
𝑃 𝑟,𝑟 ,∆𝑡 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ∆𝑡𝐷𝜕! 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ∆𝑡𝛽𝐷𝜕 𝑈! 𝛿 𝑟 − 𝑟
! ! !!! ! ! ! !!!
! !
Note that the prime on the potential means the derivative with respect to 𝑟, whereas the
!
𝜕 derivative to the left of the potential term can act on the potential or past the potential.

The Green’s function for the left factor on the right hand side is well known and is

where a primed coordinate is introduced for the purpose of computing the two factor
Green’s function as will become evident in a moment and is not an intermediate point in
the path. Treatment of the second factor on the right hand side of equation (17) follows
the macroscopic limit of the Kramers-Moyal expansion of a Master equation
representation ([5] Fox, equations (I.5.10 −14)). The Green’s function is
(19)
𝛿(𝑟! − 𝜌 (𝑟 ,∆𝑡))
!!! !!! !!!
where 𝜌 (𝑟 ,∆𝑡) solves the partial differential equation (first order in time and first

order in space)
(20)

differential equation

Because we evolve the solution to equation (21) for a very short time, ∆𝑡, we may
approximate equation (21) by expanding around 𝑟

and exhibits the over-damped, non-ballistic motion. It permits us to rewrite equation (22)

Equation (25), valid for sufficiently small ∆𝑡, is the central result from which all others
follow.
To check that we are on the correct track, we derive here the Crooks result ([6]
Crooks). Imagine a path from 𝑟 = 𝑟 to 𝑟 = 𝑟 along the sequence of 𝑟!𝑠. We call this
! ! ! ! !
the forward path. The probability for the forward path is given by
(26)
!
𝑃! 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ = 𝑑𝑟𝑃 𝑟,𝑟 ,∆𝑡
! ! ! !!!
!!!
in which each 𝑑𝑟 has the same size, and the product has 𝑗 increasing right to left. The
!
reverse path (here reversed in the sequence of coordinates only since there are no explicit
momenta) has probability

Note that the integration of the work done in equation (31) involves the midpoint rule,
consistent with the Stratonovich interpretation of stochastic differential equations with
white noise, such as underlies the incorporation of water molecule effects as Brownian
motion for the solute molecules (see TSI). Reduction of a non-Markov picture to a
Markov picture always leads to the Stratonovich interpretation in a natural way as has
occurred here ([5] Fox).
Some authors have interpreted the left hand side of equation (32) as a measure of a
path’s irreversibility, in the case of full phase space trajectories. They point out that a
positive ∆𝑄 means the forward path is more probable than the reverse path. Then they
!"#
say that for ∆𝑄 = 0 the path is reversible and, therefore, the process is reversible. A
!"#
look at pure diffusion will demonstrate that this interpretation is misleading. Diffusion is
the quintessential irreversible process in physics. However, when we set 𝑈 ≡ 0 in
equation (29) there is a perfect cancellation and the ratio of forward path probability to
reverse path probability is one. This doesn’t mean the process of diffusion is reversible. It
only means that the path entropy in the reverse direction matches that for the forward
direction. The forward path entropy is
(33)
! !
𝑑𝑟 𝑟 − 𝑟
! ! !!!
𝑆! 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ = −𝑘 ln − ≥ 0
!
4𝐷∆𝑡
4𝜋𝐷∆𝑡
!!!
which is positive, since the coordinate differentials are smaller than the standard
deviations, and reflects the irreversible property for diffusion. The expression for the
reverse path is the same (remember 𝑑𝑟 and 𝑑𝑟 are the same size). Thus going from 𝑟 to
! ! !
𝑟 increases the path entropy and so does going from 𝑟 to 𝑟 , increasing the path entropy
! ! !
by the same amount. If we did not restrict the tube of paths over its entire range, the
spread in positions for the forward paths would be much greater at the end than at the
beginning, and starting from the points of the final distribution would not shrink the
distribution down to the initial distribution for the forward paths, as the final distribution
for the reverse paths, but would instead spread it out even more. For diffusion the
forward and reverse bundles of restricted paths have the same probabilities, and their path
entropies are both positive as befits an irreversible process.
Equation (25) suggests another immediate result. Consider the most probable path
between two points 𝑟 and 𝑟 . This means we want the path for which

𝑃! 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ = 𝑑𝑟𝑃 𝑟,𝑟 ,∆𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚

where 𝑟 = 𝑟 and 𝑟 = 𝑟 . Since all probabilities are positive, the maximum occurs when

the logarithm is a maximum. Using equation (25) this means

For sufficiently small ∆𝑡 the coordinate term dominates the potential term and the

This is exactly the result for pure diffusion without inter-particle potentials. As will be
argued in the next section, typical values for the physical parameters appearing above for

These equations require a numerical solution in general. When the potentials are absent
they reduce to the pure diffusion equations (38) above. Because the potential dependent
terms are small according to equation (39) the shifts in the locations of the 𝑟 ′𝑠 for the
!
most probable path from 𝑟 to 𝑟 are also small. Any other forward path from 𝑟 to 𝑟 that
! ! ! !
deviates from the path of points that minimizes the expression in equation (36) will
decrease the probability for this other forward path. This amounts to increasing the
system entropy production relative to the most probable path (the system entropy
production for the path is given by multiplying the logarithm of the path probability given
in equation (35) by minus Boltzmann’s constant), and since the potential energy change
between 𝑟 and 𝑟 remains unchanged for conservative forces (i.e. is path independent, in
! !
contrast to the path entropy that is irreversible for interactive diffusing particles and,
therefore, path dependent), the amount of Helmholtz free energy dissipated is increased.
Put another way, the Helmholtz free energy dissipation for the most probable path
between two points is least. Conversely, the path between two points that dissipates the
Helmholtz free energy the least is the most probable path.
Three remarks are in order. 1) In the generalization to 𝑛 particles, each in 3
dimensions, the sum of squares as in equation (36) is preserved. The idea of conservative
forces is also maintained in 3𝑛 dimensions. Thus the minimization with constraint
follows directly. 2) If one explicitly includes the effects of the potential terms on the
minimization the result is that the spacing of the coordinate differences is no longer
uniform as in equation (38) but contains variable, order ∆𝑡 corrections given by equation
(40). Nevertheless the sum of the squares is a minimum and all other paths will generate
more system entropy than the most probable path that dissipates the Helmholtz free
energy the least. For related results see ([7] English) and references therein. 3)
Ubiquinone has a radius of 0.75 𝑛𝑚, and the standard deviation for the Gaussian in
equation (25) is 2𝐷∆𝑡. For the values given in equation (39) this works out to be
4.5 × 10!!" 𝑐𝑚 an amount smaller than the radius. Choosing a larger ∆𝑡, say 10!! 𝑠,
makes the standard deviation 0.45 𝑛𝑚. A single step in a tube of paths within one
standard deviation of the most probable path accounts for 68% of the probability for that
step.
We have treated the case of the most probable path from 𝑟 to 𝑟 . We may also ask
! !
what is the most probable path starting from 𝑟 , where the end point 𝑟 is determined by
! !
the path itself. The result of this question is given by equation (36). One simply sets each
quadratic term equal to zero. For pure diffusion this means that, most probably, the
particle stays put at its initial position. With inter-particle potentials present, the system
simply follows the deterministic over-damped trajectory determined by first order
ordinary differential equations in 3𝑛 dimensions, like equation (21) in one dimension.
Thus the most probable path, given only the starting point, is the deterministic over-
damped path. All other paths starting from 𝑟 generate more path entropy than the
!
deterministic, over-damped path and may end up at different final points. The most
probable path between two specified points is something different and is the path with the
least dissipation of Helmholtz free energy compared to all other paths between the same
two points. In both cases the most probable path dissipates the least Helmholtz free
energy, and conversely.
III. Implications for nano-biology
Nano-biology takes place on a length scale of nanometers, or 10 angstroms. This is
the same as for molecular biology and for biochemistry. It is a very different realm
compared to the macroscopic world. At the nano-scale viscosity dominates everything
dynamical and inertia has no significant effects. As shown by Howard Berg ([3] Berg, [2]
Fox) an E. Coli bacteria propelled by a flagella can achieve speeds of 2×10!!𝑐𝑚/𝑠 for a
run of about 1 𝑠. The bacteria’s length is 2 microns (2,000 nanometers), its width is one
micron and the viscosity of its natural environment is 0.027poise. The Reynolds number
is 7×10!!. These are the parameters of a regime in which viscosity dominates inertia. If
the bacterium is swimming at full speed and the flagella motor is suddenly turned off the
bacterium comes to a stop in just 10!!" 𝑐𝑚! In contrast to this situation for E. Coli an 8
centimeters long minnow swimming in a pond has a Reynolds number around 20,000.
Viscosity is a minor drag for the minnow. The differences between an E. Coli and a
minnow are very great. These two entities are on the mesoscopic (microns, 𝜇) and
macroscopic (centimeters, cm) size scales respectively. On the truly microscopic
(nanometers, nm) scale is the molecule ubiquinone.
Ubiquinone is a non-protein catalyst centrally located in the electron transport
chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts (plastoquinone) ([2] Fox, chapter 2). It connects
the iron-sulfur protein segment of the electron transport chain to the cytochrome (heme-
iron) protein segment of the chain, as well as transferring protons from inside the
membrane to outside the membrane. It becomes reduced (2 electrons and 2 protons) on
the inside of the membrane and oxidized (2 electrons and 2 protons) on the outside
thereby coupling the redox energy of energy metabolism to the proton energy of the
membrane (chemiosmosis). Ubiquinone has a molecular weight of 862 (864) daltons and
a radius of 0.75 nm. It moves by Brownian motion inside the lipid membrane that has a
viscosity of 25 cp (centipoise, or 0.01 g/cm-s). By randomly changing sides, and either
reducing or oxidizing, depending on which side it is on, it on average engages in a
catalytic redox cycle, vectorially coupling intra-membrane electron current to trans-
membrane proton current. This motion is strongly over-damped with a Reynolds number
of 2.4×10!!. The Langevin relaxation time is 4×10!!"𝑠. Typically one diffusive transit
of the membrane width by ubiquinone takes on average 10!!𝑠, a time very much longer
than the relaxation time and therefore in the extreme Markov limit of this naturally non-
Markov contracted process. Treating the ubiquinone dynamics as a pure diffusion process
is justified by this strong separation of time scales ([2] Fox). This circumstance will hold
for the myriads of smaller molecules inside a cell, including amino acids, sugar
molecules, nucleosides and ATP. The dimensions of a typical cell are small enough for
diffusion to be a robust source of motion that can transfer any small molecule across the
entire cell in sub-microsecond times.
The motion of kinesin, a motor protein, on microtubules has also been analyzed by
these methods ([2] Fox, chapter 4). The moving “heads” of kinesin use Brownian motion
for their movement. In this case the kinesin heads are attached to the kinesin “tether” by
“neck linkers” that exhibit elasticity. Inclusion of elasticity in the analysis introduces
another relaxation time scale as well as an elasticity period but it works out that for all
three time scales the dynamics is in the strongly over-damped Markov limit (contrary to
what a major kinesin experimentalist has claimed).
The preceding remarks are aimed at justification for the Markov limit of the non-
Markov contracted description. In most cases it works out that the system is strongly
over-damped, has very small Reynolds number and the dynamics is dominated by
viscosity. Nevertheless, on the length scales involved, Brownian motion, or its strongly
over-damped equivalent, diffusion, is very robust as a source of motion. At this stage let
us look at the evolutionary significance of the least dissipation of Helmholtz free energy
principle. Consider the basic core process of energy metabolism, the oxidation of sugar
by oxygen. Chemically, there are many sugar sizes and isotopes for given size. The basic
formula for this circumstance is 𝐻 𝐶𝑂 . For example the sugar glucose that is used in
! !
glycolysis has 𝑛 = 6. There are many stereo-isotopes with 𝑛 = 6. We will omit further
concern for this variety. Oxidation of glucose can be represented by the formula
(41)
𝐻 𝐶𝑂 + 6 𝑂 ↔ 6 𝐶𝑂 + 6 𝐻 𝑂 + 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦
! ! ! ! !
If the glucose is burned in a clean flame the conversion is total and the energy released is
pure heat amounting to a Gibbs free energy change of −686.9 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙/𝑚𝑜𝑙. The free
energy of formation of carbon dioxide and of water is much more negative than that for
an equivalent amount of glucose (the oxygen free energy of formation is zero). The
Boltzmann-Planck formula for the amount of glucose left in equilibrium, at standard
temperature and pressure, is so unfavorable that for a macroscopic amount of glucose we
could handle and manipulate there would not be left even one molecule of glucose.

The denominator is 𝑅𝑇 in units of cal/mol and at 300 Kelvin. Let the initial state be one
with equivalent amounts of glucose and oxygen molecules. This is a non-equilibrium
state. Let the final state be the state in which all glucose has been oxidized into carbon
dioxide and water. If nothing else is present then the most probable path will be in
essence the only type of path possible, an oxidation of glucose gone to completion.
Conversely, the spontaneous formation of glucose and molecular oxygen from carbon
dioxide and water is extremely unlikely.
Over the course of evolution energy metabolism has become more and more
complex and its ability to harness useful free energy from the oxidation of glucose has
increased commensurately. A very major need for energy is caused by the synthesis of
the macromolecules, proteins, polynucleotides and polysaccharides. In the case of the
first two types, the reason is that as monomers are added to the growing polymer chain
dehydration linkages are made. Because of the abundance of water this direction of
polymer synthesis is strongly thermodynamically inhibited. Cells need to be able activate
the monomers in order to override the strong hydrolysis tendency. The universal
mechanism to do this is some variation on phosphorylation of the monomers, called
activation, and the ultimate source for phosphate potential is ATP. (Proteins are made
from amino acids that are activated into amino-acyl-adenylates by ATP. Polynucleotides
are made from nucleosides (monophosphates) that are activated into nucleotides
(triphosphates) by ATP.) The core of energy metabolism, the slow oxidation of glucose
by oxygen, produces the needed ATP ([8] Fox). Four stages of glucose oxidation have
evolved. The most primitive is glycolysis that converts one glucose into two pyruvates,
two ATP’s and the reducing equivalent of two NADH’s. The two ATP’s only account for
slightly more than 2% of the available free energy. Next comes the conversion of
pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. This stage releases two CO and two NADH’s, as well as
2
generating the versatile thioester acetyl-CoA. The third stage is the citric acid cycle that
produces large amounts of reducing potential in the forms of NADH and FADH . These
2
reducing equivalents release electrons into the electron transport chains, in the fourth
stage, where coupling of electron currents to proton currents results in a transmembrane
electrochemical potential (chemiosmosis). This proton potential is discharged by ATPase
complexes embedded in the membrane that convert proton current into ATP synthesis.
When all stages operate, such as in ourselves, in our mitochondria, 38% of the energy
available from glucose oxidation is retained, for the biosynthesis of polymers, in the form
of ATP (actually 34 ATP’s and 2 GTP’s). The question is: why did evolution take
glucose oxidation in this direction, so that a greater amount of useful energy is harvested,
instead of simply converting all those glucose kcal/mol directly into heat?
The answer to the question that ended the preceding paragraph is that the most
probable path is one that minimizes the decrease in Helmholtz free energy (We spoke of
Gibbs free energy in the preceding paragraph. The difference from Helmholtz free energy
involves a pressure-volume term that remains largely invariant in the background for our
aqueous cells. Alternatively we could generalize our least dissipation of free energy
principle to the Gibbs case with the pressure-volume term playing a role more akin to the
internal energy than to the entropy.). If other molecular species are present, such as
catalysts, then more chemical options can exist and the most probable paths will involve
less free energy dissipation and more production of intermediates that retain some free
energy. Catalysts are regenerated by catalytic cycles. In the purely classical modeling
provided by the coupled interacting and diffusing particles described by equation (5)
catalysts can be modeled by including three body potentials. Interactions between species
A and B can be described by a two body potential. If their interaction is to be affected by
a catalyst, a three body potential can perform that function by changing the two body,
A/B interaction, when the catalyst is near. For example, A and B may have a short ranged
weak attraction, with a deep localized well separated from the attraction by a barrier. In
over-damped dynamics A and B would not likely get over the barrier and into the well (a
deep well could model bonding). The purely deterministic over-damped motion is
absolutely prevented from going over the barrier. Catalyst C, when close enough to A and
B, can affect the effective two body interaction between A and B by reducing the barrier
and catalyzing access to the well, through an appropriately constructed three body
potential. If desired even the approximation of the particles as points could be relaxed so
that the particles have volume, asymmetry and angle coordinates for orientation. All of
this makes the description very complex but remains possible in principle. With these
preliminaries let us consider the evolution of a primitive energy metabolism pathway that
invokes the modern biological state.
One primitive source of reducing electrons is the UV excitation of ferrous iron,
plentiful on the early earth. This is a most basic redox process:

The thiol has been regenerated like a catalyst. Indeed, in glycolysis there is an enzyme
step involving the action of a thiol group in its active site that these primitive steps here
imitate. This imitation can be taken a step further by letting the acylphosphate react with
another molecule of inorganic phosphate to form the energy rich pyrophosphate that is
capable of activating monomers.

The initial glyceraldehyde ends up partially oxidized as glycerate. These steps have been
demonstrated in the laboratory without specific catalysts ([9] Weber, [10] de Duve). With
pyrophosphate present activation and polymerization of amino acids becomes possible,
and is more probable than the direct hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate. Similar
considerations regarding the replication and transcription of DNA follow mutatis
mutandis.
Thioesters, such as in equation (46), are subject to hydrolysis. Formation of an
acylphosphate instead of direct hydrolysis preserves some of the original free energy. By
our principle of least dissipation formation of the acylphosphate is more probable than
hydrolysis of the thioester. Similarly, the acylphosphate is subject to hydrolysis but
instead can from pyrophosphate, an energy rich precursor to monomer activation. Once
again the formation of pyrophosphate is more probable because it preserves free energy.
We are beginning to see how and why many steps have arisen in the modern metabolic
harvesting of energy from the oxidation of glucose. The most probable events are those
that preserve free energy thereby dissipating it the least. As possibilities to preserve free
energy arise they are most probable. This circumstance has been established here for
strongly over-damped, thermostated systems, such as living cells. It has been justified for
the Markov limit of a purely spatial contracted description using projection operators,
boson operator representations of differential operators, the Trotter product formula and
Green’s functions.
