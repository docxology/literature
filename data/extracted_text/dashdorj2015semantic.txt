1 Introduction
Increasingly,massiveamountsofdataarebeinggenerated,stored,anddisseminatedas

Overthelastfewyears,theuseofmobilephonesassensorsofhumanbehaviorhasrad-

caller’slocations,variesaccordingtoexpectedtrafficandterrain. Celltowersaretyp-
ically spaced 2-3 km apart in rural areas and 400-800 m apart in densely populated
areas. Commonly the CDRs are available as anonymous, often incomplete or aggre-

Currentresearch[2,8,23,45]notesthatwithapureCDR,itispossibletoidentify
humanbehaviors,butresultssufferfromtheheterogeneity,uncertaintyandcomplexity
ofrawdatasetsandthatthelackofqualitativecontentisincludedinthedataitselfthat
maybeusedtohelptoinferhumanbehaviors. Inspiteofthebadqualityofdata,some
researchers are able to identify a certain level of human behaviors with the help of
featuresthatcanbeindirectlyobtainedfromtherawCDR.Thesefeaturesareobserved
informationaboutreal-worldcases. Forexample, auser’shomelocationisidentified
bythefrequentstay(location)oftheuserbetweenmidnighttoearlymorning[8].These
featuresaremostlyspecifiedbydomainexperts. Mostofthebehavioraldatasets,such
as CDR or GPS traces, are relatively large raw datasets where user location is not

andthemeasurementaccuracyofthedataislowandcoarsegrained. Whilethisdata
providesextensiveinformationregardingwhenandwherepeoplego,ittypicallydoes
notallowunderstandingofwhichactivityisperformedatthatlocation.
Whenthecontextinformationofrawdataisnotdirectlyavailableinthedata,some
useful characteristic values for human behaviors can still be discovered by analyzing
the activity patterns of mobile network communication [10, 26, 64]. For example,
anomalouseventscanbeobservedbythechangeofdailycommunicationactivitypat-
terns[10]. Usingsomesemanticsaboutongoingevents(e.g.,thelocationandthetime
of an event), researchers [2, 8, 8, 23, 31] are able to discover some relationships be-
tween human behaviors (i.e., communication and mobility patterns), and emergency
(e.g.,earthquake,blackout)ornonemergencyevents(e.g.,concert,festival). However,
the results are limited to only specific events and the correlations between the events
andhumanbehaviors. Forinstance,thequantitativeanalysisofbehavioralchangesin
3
presence of extreme emergency events show radical increase of call frequency right
aftertheeventoccurs,withlongtermimpacts[2].
Humanbehaviorisinfluencedbymanyexternalfactors,suchasweathercondition,
urban structure, social event. Knowing the context, where a person is important to
guesswhathe/sheisdoing. Forinstance,ifapersonisinorclosetoarestaurantand
makes a phone call around 1:00 pm., or 8:00 pm., then the person is probably look-
ingforeatingsomefood, or(s)heworksattherestaurant. Inthisarticle, wepropose
to formalize the context as a pair (cid:104)l,t(cid:105), where l is a location (= geographical area)
and t is a time interval. A context can be associated with various information. For
instance, weather, events, surrounding geo-objects, and more. For every record in a
CDR dataset, it is possible to determine to a certain level of approximation the con-
text associated to such a record. Some research studies [24, 30, 45, 46, 46, 65] have
been performed to understand the correlations of human behaviors to environmental
factors,usingsomeadditionalcontextualinformationaboutweather,socialeventsand
geographicalinformationsystems. Thisfocusesontheinferenceofacertainlevelof
humanactivitiesinacertaincondition. Forinstance,humanbehaviorchangesduring
periodsofuncomfortableweathercondition[65].
AmongtheliteratureofrawCDRanalysis,researchersmostlyemploydata-mining
and machine learning algorithms1 [17, 50] in the analysis. Supervised learning algo-
rithms (e.g., Multiclass SVM, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Decision
Tree, KNN) can achieve reasonable accuracy on the CDR analysis but they require
qualitativeandquantitativepropertiesindataandgroundtruthinformationinorderto
perform behavior classification well. The researchers claimed to acquire a sufficient
amount of labeled training data. For their studies, but obtaining ground-truth infor-
mation(e.g., userdiariesandsurveys)fortrainingdataremainsaveryexpensiveand
almostunmanageable task, especially whenone considersthe largeamounts ofCDR
datathatneedtobeannotatedandthediversityinthecontextsofmobilephoneevents

The result of CDR analysis usually provides quantitative evidence that are pre-

Trento containing completely anonymized cell (antennas). Cell identification is used
foridentificationofsomeportionofaphysicalgeographicalareafeaturedwithinaset

knowledge of mapping between cell ID’s and coverage areas, irregularity of the size

4.1 Humanbehaviorontology(HBOnto)
The Human Behavior Ontology (HBOnto) provides a set of possible activities for a
given POI type or in the time of day, i.e., it does a priori activity selection on the
basis of POIs and time of the day. For instance, it excludes “sleeping” if the time of
the day is 1:00 pm. and it excludes “hiking” if you are in the city center. It includes
activities only if there are POIs that activates them. For example, an area containing
a swimming pool activities swimming activity. The HBOnto5 is composed of three
ontologies (see Figure 1(b)). OSMOnto, which contains the various classes of POIs
asclassifiedinOSM;ActOnto,whichcontainsthedifferenttypesofhumanactivities
we are interested in; TimeOnto, which contains temporal references in which those

4.1.2 TheOntologyofHumanActivity—ActOnto
The ActOnto ontology is a taxonomy of human activities. ActOnto contains totally
217 human activity classes hierarchically organized in different levels up to four lev-
els. The upper level is composed of 10 activity types (see the Table 2). Various
sources are exploited to classify those activities, such as Yellow Pages6, Human Re-
source Management7, and Olympic Games8 and we also asked for support from do-
main experts. The ontology has been constructed manually. Figure 3 shows the top
two levels of the human activities taxonomy. We use description logic to formalize
the hierarchy of human activities with axioms. For example, travel by airplane (cid:118)
travel by transport,travel by car (cid:118)travel by transport
.
4.1.3 TheOntologyofTime—TimeOnto
Human activities are also correlated to time and, in particular, to the time of day and
thedayofweek. Forexample,inearlymorning,peoplehavebreakfastandintheaf-

A POI activates a set of human activities that people can perform when they are in
thatobject,orinitsneighborhood. Forinstance,inarestaurantpeopleusuallyperform

Every poi is related with a set of activities A(poi ) (cid:118) {a ,a ,..,a } which can be

performed or hosted there or nearby. For example, on a highway road, traveling by
car is the most usual activity. The relationship between human activities and POIs
is represented with the object property “what can be done”. The assertion of this

4.3.2 LikelihoodofHumanActivityfromasetofPOIsinaGivenLocation
POIs are the most important factors affecting the likelihood of activity occurrence.
But not all the POIs has the same weight. Some POIs, such as bus stops, small
shops, ATM, etc., which frequently occur in several areas, have a minor discrimina-
tive influence on the likelihood estimation than very distinctive POIs, like an airport
oraswimmingpool. BorrowingtheapproachcommonlyusedintheInformationRe-
trieval, we estimate the importance of POIs in a given area by the Term Frequency-
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) [55] function. In this case, the Term Fre-
quency(TF)factormeasuresthefrequencyofaPOIinagivenarea,whiletheInverse
Document Frequency (IDF) factor gives an indication of the general discriminative
power of a POI. A high IDF factor is associated with POIs that are rare while a low
IDF factor is associated with POIs that are very common and thus are of low use-
fulness for distinguishing among different areas. For these common POIs, the ratio
inside the logarithm of the IDF formula approaches 1, bringing the TF-IDF closer to
0. More in details, the weight of the POIs in location l is estimated by the formula,
tf-idf(f,l) = N(f,l) ∗log |L| , where f is a given POI; f ∈ F,
argmax{N(w,l):w∈l} |{l∈L:f∈l}|
w
F={building,hospital,supermarket,...}andlisagivenlocation;l∈L,L={location1,
location2,location3,...},N(f,l)isthenumberofoccurrencethatPOIf appearsinlo-
cation l and argmax{N(w,l) : w ∈ l} is the maximum occurrence of all the POIs
w
in location l, |L| is the number of all locations, |{l ∈ L : f ∈ l}| is the number of
locations, where POI f appears. This way, after we assign a weight to each POI in
a given area, we retrieve a set of human activities relevant to those POIs in the area
by performing reasoning on the HBOnto ontology. A weight of POIs is propagated
to the relevant actions, and the total weight of a given action is estimated as follow:
W(a,l) = (cid:80) tf-idf(f,l), where a is the action in location l, f is the element of
f∈F(a) |A(f)|
POItypeswhichderiveactiona,|A(f)|isthenumberofelements(actions)intheset
A(f), andF(a)isthesetofPOItypesassociatedtotheactiona. Theprobabilityof
human activity that happen in location l is a probability given by P(a|l) = W(a,l),
W(l)
whereW(a,l)istheweightofhumanactivityathatoccursinlocationl; l ∈ L, L=
{location1, location2, location3,...}, and W(l) isthetotal weightofallactivitiesthat

Startingwiththecentroidofalocation, weconsiderPOIsinlocationswithin100

locationsisatlowerthanh=50(asadefault),weexpandtheaggregationradiusby25

aggregation radiusreaches tomaximum radius of3.000 mwhich was chosenconsis-

In building this application, first of all, we needed to build a density-based POI

the OSM. Using Quantium GIS10, the map of the city has been divided into a grid
of dimensions 401 x 302 cells in the beginning, where each unit size of the grid is

We employed user feedback for evaluating the model in the previous section, but the
ability to reflect actual human activity is not perfect (note the aforementioned limita-
tions of user feedback data we collected in Trento city). Here, we introduce another
source of data that could serve as a direct proxy for human economical activity for a
more sophisticated evaluation of our HRBModel. We use bank card transaction data
collected in Barcelona, Spain which were performed at POS terminals by users. The
typeofbusinessactivityateveryPOSterminal, forinstance, atadepartmentstoreor

a restaurant, etc., can reveal the human activities that can be performed at such a lo-
cation. Withtheuseofthisdata,weevaluatetheperformanceofourHRBModelina

Further, we re-partitioned the grid using the quad-tree approach to ensure that each
location contains h ∈ [10,20] POIs. Final partitioning is presented in Figure 11(a).
In total, 3,853 locations were processed. Using the data coming OSM, we populated

the POI filtering results compared to the raw POIs. In this case the POIs are 5 times

is associated with a business category: therefore, 76 types of businesses are given
for all the POSs, such as travel, food, hypermarkets, hotels, real estate, automation,
barsandrestaurants,personalcare,sportandtoys,technology,home,content,fashion,
leisure, health, transport, etc. Since we use both POIs and POSs in the data sets in
our evaluation, we adjust them so that they are comparable to avoid a semantic gap

5.3 Extendedevaluationofthemodel
Inthissection,weconsideranextensivevalidationoftheHRBModelinordertoesti-
mateifPOIdatacanbeagoodproxyforpredictingsuchaspecializedtypeofactivity
(economical activity) at the local scale. For that purpose, we compare the possible
activity distribution predicted by our model for each location across the city with the
actual data on the observed spending activity in POS at that location. This gives us
ground-truth information on for instance, what types of economic activity are occur-
ringinacity. However, spatialdata(i.e., POIandPOSdata)distribution(seeFigure
14)isveryuncertainandheterogeneous,andextractingmeaningfulinformationfrom
itisaverychallengingtask.Thedatacanbeimpreciseandnotavailableinsomeareas.
Theheterogeneityofthedatadirectlyinfluencestheconfidenceregardinghowthedata
ischaracterized. Weperformedcity-widenormalizationofPOIactivitydistributionto
match that of POS, and then matched the different categories of human activities in
thePOIandPOSdata,whichgivesgoodaccuracyandgoodprecisionbothatthelocal
scaleandfordifferentland-usetypes.
In our analysis, POS data reflects spending activity on a fine-grained scale, eco-
nomic activities, which are very important component of spending activity. The POI
data, on the other hand, is coarse grained, and each of its points represent a single
coarse-grained geographical object, not the objects within it. For example, POS ma-
chinesareassociatedwitheverystoreatthemall,andthetypeofPOSrepresentsatype
of activity performed at the store. But in POI data, the mall could be represented as
asinglebuildingoftype“mall”,whichdoesnotcontainanyinformationaboutstores
withinthemall. Thisgranularitydifferencecausesaquantitativedifferenceinthecat-
egoriesofactivitiesinbetweenthePOIandPOSdata. Thesedifferencescouldintro-

we expanded the aggregation radius by 25 m if fewer than 50 POI’s and POSs were
contained in intersecting locations, or until the radius reaches to 3.000 m. This also

7 Conclusion
Even without taking a person’s environment into account, many factors influence the
collectivehumanbehavior: thegeographicalinformationsystemiscertainlyonlyone
ofthesefactors. Weproposedamodelabletoenrichmobilephonedatarecordswith
thecontextofhumanactivity.Thequalitativetermsofthehumanactivitiescanbeused

nationofontologicalandstochasticmodel,HRBModel,forpredictingasetofhuman

relationships could be investigated, in principal, based on diverse geographical infor-

it demonstrates the applicability and scalability of the model under the conditions of

thermore, thismodeltakesvarioustypesofspatialandtemporalfactorsintoaccount.
Basedonourevaluationsperformedintwodifferentcities,thepredictionleveldepends
to some extent on the granularity of the activity being predicted. The analysis shows
thatthelevelofactivitypredictionfromthePOIdataissignificant(around84–95%).
Asweconcentratedonthemodelevaluationforaspecificeconomictypeofactivities
using point of sale bank card spending data, we validated that within areas of differ-
ent land-use types, the POI is a good proxy for predicting those economic activities
with81–90%accuracyindense,railway,andcommercialareas. Thiswaythecontext
of mobile network records can be used to deepen the context aware human activity
recognition from the mobile network events. Hence, a number of challenges remain
for future research and deeper investigations of human and environmental dynamics,
suchasbehaviorrecognitionandclassificationfromthesemanticallyenrichedCDR.
