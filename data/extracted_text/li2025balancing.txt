Balancing Exploration and Cybersickness: Investigating
Curiosity-Driven Behavior in Virtual Environments
Tangyao Li, and Yuyang Wang, Member, IEEE
Abstract—Virtual reality offers the opportunity for immersive
exploration, yet it is often undermined by cybersickness. How-
ever, how individuals strike a balance between exploration and
discomfort remains unclear. Existing method (e.g., reinforcement
learning) often fail to fully capture the complexities of navigation
and decision-making patterns. This study investigates how curios-
ity influences users’ navigation behavior, particularly how users
strike a balance between exploration and discomfort. We propose
curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making
and apply the free energy principle to model the relationship
between curiosity and user behavior quantitatively. Our findings
indicate that users generally adpot conservative strategies when
navigating. Also, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual
environment changes.These results illustrate the dynamic inter-
play between exploration and discomfort. Additionally, it offers
a new perspective on how curiosity drives behavior in immersive
environments, providing a foundation for designing adaptive VR
environments. Future research will further refine this model by
incorporating additional psychological and environmental factors
to improve prediction accuracy.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Virtual reality (VR) enables immersive experiences that
transcend the boundaries of time and space, with virtual
navigation serving as a core component of this immersion [1].
Through navigation, users explore environments and derive
rewards such as completing tasks, discovering new spaces, or
enjoying the immersive experience [2], [3]. However, these
experiences are shaped by a complex interplay between cu-
riosity and potential risks, particularly cybersickness [4]. This
interplay profoundly impacts user behavior, as curiosity drives
exploration of novel environments, while the risk of discomfort
often tempers such impulses. Understanding this balance is
crucial for designing VR systems that are both engaging and
comfortable.
Curiosity is a key driver of exploratory behavior in VR,
often prompting users to seek out novel and uncertain ex-
periences [5]. However, individual differences, such as prior
VR experience and personal risk tolerance, lead to diverse
interaction patterns [6], [7]. While some users eagerly explore,
others adopt conservative strategies to avoid risks, particularly
in environments with a high likelihood of cybersickness. This
highlights the importance of investigating how curiosity and
reward interact to shape user decision-making. Insights into
this relationship could boost the development of personalized

VR applications that balance engagement with user com-
fort [8].
Despite its significance, the dynamic relationship between
curiosity and cybersickness remains underexplored. Cybersick-
ness arises from sensory conflicts between visual input and
bodily perception during spatial locomotion in VR, leading
to symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and eye strain [9].
These symptoms are prevalent, with 80% to 95% of VR
users experiencing some degree of discomfort, and 5% to
30% abandoning sessions due to severe symptoms [10]. While
much research has focused on the prevalence and causes
of cybersickness, the role of curiosity-driven exploration in
exacerbating or mitigating discomfort has received limited
attention [5]. Addressing this gap is essential for improving
user experience in VR.
Behavior in VR is further complicated by the inherent
uncertainty of virtual environments and the brain’s limited
capacity to process real-time information [11]. This often
leads to irrational decisions, particularly when users face con-
flicts between curiosity-driven exploration and reward-seeking
behavior [12]. Sensory conflicts can amplify this tension,
creating a complex dynamic where curiosity, reward, and
discomfort intersect. Understanding these behavioral strategies
is key to addressing both the cognitive and physiological
challenges users encounter in VR.
Analyzing navigation speed profiles offers a novel approach
to studying these dynamics. By examining how users balance
curiosity and reward during navigation, we can gain insights
into the factors influencing irrational decisions and the severity
of cybersickness. Notably, in the context of the current study,
the concept of “reward” is not modeled as a beneficial outcome
but as a measure of the severity of cybersickness experienced
during virtual navigation. This reframing highlights the ten-
sion between curiosity-driven exploration and the discomfort
associated with sensory conflicts, offering a unique perspective
on user behavior in VR.
Ultimately, the severity of cybersickness is closely tied to
how users negotiate the trade-off between immersive rewards
and discomfort [13]. Investigating this “reward-curiosity con-
flict” through user navigation patterns offers critical insights
into the mechanisms driving behavior in VR [12]. By model-
ing exploratory behavior, this research aims to advance VR
interaction design, reduce cybersickness, and improve user
experience. The contributions are as follows:
• We employed a machine learning framework, the inverse
free energy principle (iFEP), to estimate the internal
variables underlying decision-making processes and to
model user behavior and interaction dynamics in VR
environments.

• By applying the iFEP method to time-series data from VR
navigation, we identified key variables such as curiosity
and the modeled “reward” (quantified as the severity of
cybersickness). This approach offers novel insights into
how users negotiate the trade-off between curiosity-driven
exploration and the risk of discomfort.
Section II reviews studies on individual differences in be-
havior during virtual navigation, identifying gaps this research
addresses. Section III outlines the methodological framework,
including the application of the inverse free energy princi-
ple (iFEP). Section IV presents and interprets the findings,
alongside an evaluation of alternative approaches. Section V
discusses the implications of the results for understanding VR
user behavior and interaction design.
II. R ELATED WORK
A. User behavior in VR
User behavior in virtual environments varies widely due to
individual differences. VR provides a controlled platform for
experiments, where participants’ movements can be continu-
ously recorded, enabling the collection of validated datasets for
comprehensive analysis [14]. These datasets are instrumental
in identifying the factors that influence user behavior during
virtual navigation, which in turn impact the user experience
[15].
Proxemic information, derived from user positioning, is
critical for quantifying behaviors such as social apporach and
avoidance [16]. Won et al. [17] leveraged head orientation
data to analyze scanning behavior in a virtual classroom,
which could indicate student anxiety levels, while Gillath et
al. [18] used proxemic patterns to identify prosocial approach
behaviors. In addition, Javdani Rikhtehgar et al. [19] examined
the use of eye gaze to understand the user’s information-
seeking behavior in an exhibition.
Comparisons between VR and real-world proxemic patterns
have revealed both similarities and differences. Bailenson et al.
[20] reported that proxemic behaviors in VR often mirror those
in physical settings. Additionally, walking speeds in virtual
environments generally align with real-world speeds [21],
although Iryo-Asano et al. [22] found that maximum walking
speeds tend to be lower in VR. Notably, Wei et al. [23] re-
ported that users with greater technological experience exhibit
higher immersion and confidence, leading to more effective
navigation behaviors.
B. The role of curiosity in decision-making
Curiosity plays a pivotal role in human decision-making, es-
pecially in environments where uncertainty-driven exploration
occurs, even in the absence of external incentives and stimuli
[5], [24], [25]. In VR settings, curiosity has been shown to
motivate users to engage more deeply with their surroundings,
fostering active exploration.
Empirical studies shed light on the neural and behavioral
dynamics of curiosity. For instance, Jepma et al. [26] demon-
strated that curiosity activates brain regions associated with
conflict and arousal, while resolving curiosity triggers reward-
related neural pathways. Over time, the impact of curiosity
on decision-making evolves, as prolonged information gaps
can diminish users’ anticipation and reduce their exploratory
drive [27]. To address such issue, Tu and Lee [28] found
that interest-driven curiosity had a strong positive influence
on engagement. Despite its potential to introduce discomfort
in uncertain situations, individuals are naturally drawn to the
unknown [27].
To model and investigate curiosity, various methodologies
have been employed [12], [27]. The free energy principle
(FEP), introduced by Karl Friston under the Bayesian brain
hypothesis [29]–[31], frames decision-making as the optimiza-
tion of both reward-seeking and curiosity-driven behaviors.
While FEP provides a framework for understanding these
dynamics, a limitation lies in the assumption that curiosity
and rewards are weighted equally, which does not fully reflect
real-world behavior. For example, Konaka and Naoki [32]
noted that traditional FEP models assume constant curiosity,
neglecting the dynamic nature of user curiosity, which fluc-
tuates over time. Similarly, Millidge et al. [33] criticized the
oversimplification of curiosity in bi-choice tasks, where the
interplay between curiosity and rewards is more complex and
context-dependent.
Machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL)
offer an alternative approach to modeling curiosity [34]. While
RL focuses on maximizing future rewards through a series
of actions, it also distinguishes between extrinsic rewards
(externally set) and intrinsic rewards (self-generated by the
agent) [35]. Notice that the “reward” mentioned here refers to
the terminology in RL, which is different from the “reward”
discussed in the later section that relates to the terminology
in iFEP. RL-based models of curiosity-driven exploration
are typically divided into novelty-based and prediction-error
algorithms. In novelty-based models, curiosity motivates the
brain to explore new, unfamiliar tasks, while prediction-error
models suggest that curiosity is driven by the need to improve
predictions about the environment [24]. Despite the usefulness
of these models, they fall short of capturing the complexity
of user curiosity in immersive VR settings, where exploration
is often intentional and guided by the user’s curiosity, not a
passive, random process as often modeled in RL [36].
C. Cybersickness and curiosity-driven behavior
Cybersickness and curiosity interact in complex ways to
shape user navigation in virtual environments. While cyber-
sickness typically discourages movement by inducing discom-
fort [37], [38], curiosity may drive users to explore novel
areas despite potential adverse effects. For instance, users
may choose to continue moving forward out of interest in
unexplored content, even when early signs of cybersick-
ness appear. Conversely, discomfort may override exploratory
impulses, leading to more conservative or avoidance-based
behaviors. Understanding how users internally weigh curiosity
against discomfort is essential for modeling realistic navigation
patterns and optimizing VR system design.
Individual differences further impact this balance. Research
has shown that factors such as age, gender, health, and VR
experience influence the susceptibility and severity of cyber-
sickness [6], [39]. These individual traits also interact with the
JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 3
use of HMDs that worsen discomfort due to sensory conflict
between visual and vestibular inputs. Rivera-Flor et al. [40] re-
ported that discomfort symptoms arised when using HMD for
display affect individual’s motivation and attention. Specially,
participants reported higher frustration and lower motivation
when using the HMD. Familiarity with virtual environments,
such as through gaming [41], can mitigate cybersickness by
improving spatial prediction and reducing sensory conflict.
However, cybersickness remains a critical factor in shaping
user behavior and overall satisfaction. Wang et al. [42] found
that cybersickness affects walking patterns during navigation,
reducing users’ sense of presence. Similarly, Gabel et al. [43]
demonstrated that cybersickness could impair performance in
tasks such as text reading, negatively impacting retention and
comprehension in educational contexts. Although quantitative
models have advanced in predicting cybersickness, they often
neglect individual cognitive traits like curiosity [44], [45].
In short, users constantly balance between their desire to
explore and the risk of discomfort when using VR. This
interaction between curiosity and cybersickness is especially
critical in self-paced navigation, where neither external incen-
tives nor system constraints dictate movement. Thus, modeling
user behavior in VR requires a combination of curiosity-driven
motivation and cybersickness-driven aversion.
III. M ETHODS
To analyze users’ irrational curiosity-driven behavior during
virtual navigation, we examined brain decision-making pro-
cesses in immersive environments using the ReCU model and
the iFEP method [32]. The ReCU model simulates decision-
making by optimizing the expected net utility, while the iFEP
method quantitatively decodes this process, estimating key
influencing factors. By integrating a curiosity parameter, we
accounted for the seemingly irrational decisions made by
users, enabling a more nuanced understanding of interaction
behavior patterns through quantitative analysis. Furthermore,
we investigated how the severity of cybersickness influenced
users’ navigation strategies, particularly their decisions to
accelerate or rest while exploring virtual environments.
A. The ReCU Model
The ReCU model was designed to replicate the user’s
decision-making process. It assumes that curiosity and reward
are factors that could influence decision-making, where curios-
ity is one of the reasons a user makes irrational decisions, and
reward refers to the credit received after choosing a particular
action. In this way, we could discover how VR users determine
their navigation speed in an immersive environment, more
specifically, balance the desire to explore the VR environment
and the severity of cybersickness. The replication process
involves two steps. Initially, the VR user adjusts the reward
probability for each action based on their observation. Follow-
ing this, the VR user decides based on the reward probability
and curiosity. According to the ReCU model, the VR user
seeks to maximize their expected net utility, which is the sum
of the expected reward and information gain. The expected net
utility at trial t for choosing action at+1 is determined by
Ut(at+1) = E[rewardt+1]| {z }
recoginition+ reward intensity
+ct × E[infot+1]| {z }
conditional entropy
+ marginal entropy
(1)
where ct denotes the curiosity level at trial t, at denotes the
action selected at trial t, and E[·] represents the mathematical
expectation operator. Curiosity is modeled as a factor that
could influence the participant to make irrational decisions
and is assumed to fluctuate over time. In our context, reward
refers to the presence of cybersickness, which can be seen as
a negative reward. In addition, the action selection at follows
a sigmoid function
P(at) = 1
1 + e−β∆Ut
, (2)
where β controls the action selection’s randomness and∆Ut =
Ut(at+1) − Ut(a′
t+1).
B. The iFEP Method
The free energy principle (FEP) posits that any system aims
to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and actual
observations through active inference [30]. This principle also
suggests that systems seek to minimize free energy, which
serves as an upper bound for surprise. In the model presented
by [32], the primary objective is to maximize expected net
utility, which corresponds to the negative of expected free
energy. A detailed formulation of expected net utility can be
found in Appendix A.
To decode the decision-making process of VR users, we
employed the inverse Free Energy Principle (iFEP) method,
which analyzes behavioral data, including user actions and
observations. This decoding process quantifies internal states,
such as curiosity levels, recognition of reward probabilities
for various options, and confidence in those estimates. The
iFEP method operates through a repetitive cycle of predicting
internal states followed by corrections, necessitating prolonged
trials of behavioral data for the particle filter to converge
effectively [32].
C. Dataset
Sixteen participants (8 females and 8 males; mean age =
25.63 years, SD = 2.91, 25th percentile = 24, 50th percentile
= 24.5, 75th percentile = 26) were recruited to perform a
navigation task in a VR environment1 (see Figure 1 and suppl-
mentary video). The scene was designed to focus on individual
self-directed exploration. Prior to the experiment, participants
completed a health and gaming/VR familiarity survey to report
potential issues that could affect the study. The experiment
received IRB approval No.HKUST(GZ)-HSP-2024-0003, and
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Each participant completed three navigation tasks on sep-
arate days, with a 4- to 5-day interval between each session.
Each task lasted 4 minutes, leading to a total duration of 12
minutes. At the end of the experiment, subjects received gifts

in recognition of their contribution. Figure 2 gives the timeline
of the experiment procedure.
At each trial of the navigation task, behavioral data were
recorded for modeling with the iFEP method. This included
movement speed within the environment, generated by users
sliding the touchpad of the VR hand controller, the actions
performed, and the severity of cybersickness experienced.
Collecting the data enables a more accurate analysis of user
behavior.
The experiment procedure is as follows:
• The participants received a brief introduction to using
the HTC Vive Pro hand controllers to navigate in the
virtual environment. Also, they can choose to terminate
the experiment early if discomfort occurs.
• The participants wear an HTC Vive Pro head-mounted
display on their head (to display the virtual environment)
and an Empatica E4 wristband on their arm (to collect
the electrodermal activity (EDA) signal at a frequency of
4Hz).
• The participants enter the virtual environment and navi-
gate using the HTC Vive Pro hand controller touchpad
along the highlighted path illustrated in Figure 1. To
minimize potential confounds in physiological data, par-
ticipants were instructed to avoid unnecessary speech and
body movements during the VR task [46]. Head-tracking
(head position and rotation), motion (speed and rotation),
and biosignal (EDA, blood volume pulse, temperature,
and heart rate) data were collected during the entire
process.
• The participants completed the SSQ both before and
after each navigation task. The difference between post-
exposure and pre-exposure contributes to the SSQ score:
SSQ = SSQpost − SSQpre (3)
The classification of the severity of cybersickness based
on the SSQ score is as follows [45]:
SSQ =



Negligible , if 0 ≤ SSQ ≤ 5
Low , if 5 < SSQ≤ 20
Moderate , if 20 < SSQ≤ 40
High , if SSQ >40
(4)
In the navigation task, we categorize the movement of each
participant into Rest and Accelerate based on the average speed
every 8 seconds. In addition, we calculate the motion sickness
dose value ( MSDV) [47] as an estimation of the participant’s
cybersickness degree using the following formula:
MSDV =
Z T
0
a2(t)dt
1
2
, (5)
where T is the total duration, and a is the acceleration com-
puted from speed and time. Then, based on the MSDV value,
it was categorized into Cybersickness and No cybersickness,
which represent feeling cybersickness or not, respectively.
Also, the participants wore an Empatica E4 wristband, which
could record their EDA data at a rate of 4Hz. The extracted
skin conductance response (SCR) signals, which represent the
phasic component of the electrodermal activity (EDA) signal,
serve as the ground truth for the pwarticipant’s probability of
experiencing cybersickness.
A Chi-square test is conducted to examine the relationship
between curiosity and cybersickness based on the participants’
SSQ score and curiosity level. The result is statistically sig-
nificant ( χ2 = 7 .27, p= 0 .026), implying that the severity
of discomfort may influence users’ interaction within the
virtual environment. We also conducted a post hoc power
analysis based on the observed Chi-square test result to assess
the adequacy of our sample size ( N = 16 , α = 0 .05).
The calculated effect size (Cram ´er’s V = 0 .67) yielded an
estimated statistical power of approximately 0.77, indicating a
77% probability of detecting a true effect. This suggests that
the study had sufficient power for the analyses performed.
We performed data preprocessing to fit the iFEP model.
First, we utilized the original dataset’s speed, EDA signal,
and SSQ score. Second, we divided the data collected in one
task into 30 intervals. Each interval represents one trial and
contains data over 8 seconds. Therefore, each participant’s
data was segmented into 90 trials, with each 8-second interval
chosen to balance the need for robust action classification and
alignment with the phasic latency of EDA responses.
The iFEP method takes the participant’s action and cy-
bersickness state at each trial as input. It predicts the inter-
nal states at each trial, including cybersickness probability,
confidence, and curiosity. The internal states model factors
that influence a participant to decide whether to go forward
or stay still. Therefore, by analyzing these factors, the iFEP
method could decode how the participants make decisions by
estimating the intensity of curiosity and ground truth reward
probability.

IV. R ESULTS
This section presents the decoding results after applying
the participant’s speed and EDA data to the iFEP method. We
conducted a series of tests to evaluate the suitability of using
the EDA data in the ReCU model and the iFEP method. In
this process, we substituted simulated EDA data into the ReCU
model and the iFEP method to analyze the results and validate
the approach. After validating the suitability, we substituted
the organized user behavioral data into the iFEP method and
analyzed the predicted variables.
A. Validation of the ReCU Model
To evaluate the ReCU model’s ability to estimate users’
cybersickness levels, we generated synthetic EDA signals
using the eda_simulate() function from the NeuroKit2
library. The simulation test has 1000 trials, and the ground
truth of the cybersickness degree is computed as described in
Section III. Given the SCR signals extracted from the simu-
lated EDA signals, the ReCU model replicates the decision-
making process and estimates the selection probability for
each option ( Rest and Accelerate) and the reward probability
(i.e., the probability of feeling cybersickness). We assume
constant curiosity changes over time and is determined by
ct = 4 sin(4 T−1πt), where t represents the trial number
and T represents the total number of trials. While several
formulations of ct were tested and yielded comparable results,
we present only this version for clarity. The learning rate α is
0.05, the randomness of action selection β is 2, P0 = 0.8, and
σw = 0 .4. Moreover, the ground truth of the cybersickness
degree was determined by the average of SCR signals every
8 seconds, and the probability of feeling cybersickness was
assumed to be 10%, 40%, 60%, and 90% to align with the
probabilistic outputs of the model. This assigned probability
levels are solely used for visualization and interpretive clarity,
and do not influence the underlying computational processes.
From Figure 4b, we can see that the ReCU model can
predict the reward probability reasonably well. Also, the
confidence in the estimated reward probability for one option
increases when that option is selected and vice versa (Figure
4c). See Appendix B for the formulation of confidence.
Additionally, the new information gained may decrease if the
same option is selected consecutively (Figure 4d). Thus, it may
encourage the participant to choose another option to obtain
more information about the environment. This result shows the
validation of the ReCU model for estimating user movement
in a VR environment.
B. Validation of the iFEP method
After that, we used the same simulated EDA signals to test
the validity of the iFEP method in the application of decoding
the user’s decision-making process. First, the extracted SCR
signals were input into the ReCU model to estimate the action
selection and whether to receive a reward. The estimated
reward probability for each option was treated as the ground
truth (dashed line in Figures 3c and 3d) and compared with
the results from the iFEP method. In addition, the estimated
action and reward were inputs for the iFEP method to decode
the reward probability and intensity of curiosity. The learning
rate α is set as 0.05, the inverse temperature β is 2, P0 = 0.8
and σw = 0.4. Figure 3a shows the action selection for 1000
trials, where the shorter line indicates no reward after selecting
an action, and the longer line indicates the presence of a
reward after selecting an action. Moreover, we can see that
the estimated reward probability for each option (red and blue
solid lines in Figures 3c and 3d) correctly decodes the ground
truth (dashed lines in Figures 3c and 3d). As a result, Figure
3 shows that the iFEP method could decode user decision-
making processes in a VR environment.
Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the iFEP method
to accurately decode user decision-making processes by ap-
plying different noise values to the intensity of curiosity. As

shown in Figure 5a, the predictions of curiosity intensity with
noise follow a similar pattern to the ground truth. Also, the
root mean square error is minor when the value of the noise
intensity is smaller (Figure 5b). Moreover, there is a positive
correlation between the estimated and the ground truth of
curiosity (Figures 5c and 5d). By comparing the estimated
and ground-truth curiosity values, we can conclude that the
prediction of curiosity intensity is robust under the influence
of noise.
C. Results with virtual navigation data
After validating the ReCU model and iFEP method, we
applied real virtual navigation data from the above-mentioned
dataset to decode how the user chooses between Accelerate
and Rest resulting from varying curiosity levels. We analyzed
how the iFEP method predicted participants’ awareness of
their likelihood of experiencing cybersickness. Also, we eval-
uated the participant’s navigation behavior in the navigation
task. The behavioral data are set as described in Section III-C,
and the total behavioral data are 90 trials for each participant.
Here, we present the results of one participant, whose features
are commonly observed in the results of other participants.
However, the differences in features in other participants’
results will also be taken into account.
Figure 6 shows the decoding result of one participant’s
navigation data using the iFEP method. Figure 6a indicates
the action selected and the presence of reward in each trial.
Although the estimated values do not perfectly match the
ground truth value, the estimations for both actions can rec-
ognize the fluctuation in the actual cybersickness probabilities
(Figures 6c and 6d). Another reason affecting the accuracy of
the estimated value could be that the iFEP assumes a gradual
change in reward probability rather than a sudden change [32].
The confidence in the prediction of the reward probability for
choosing to Rest and Accelerate is demonstrated by Figure
6e. Generally, the intensity of curiosity is negative for most
trials, with some positive curiosity around trials 30 to 60, as
shown in Figure 6f. According to the SSQ classification, this
participant has an average SSQ score of 39.89, indicating a
moderate cybersickness. Such an outcome indicates that the
participant is relatively conservative in their choice of action
during the navigation task. While the majority of partici-
pants exhibited overall negative curiosity levels, behavioral
data from three individuals consistently demonstrated positive
curiosity throughout most experimental trials.
Additionally, we analyzed user behavior data to investi-
gate the correlation between expected information gain and
curiosity. We computed the correlation coefficient between
the expected information gain and curiosity and between the
expected information gain and the temporal derivative of
curiosity. As shown in Figure 7a, the correlation between
expected information gain and curiosity at time lag = 0
is minimal (0.0114), indicating no significant relationship
between the two variables when they are aligned in time.
However, the maximum correlation coefficient, 0.6704, occurs
at a time lag of -24 samples. This suggests that, while there is
no immediate correlation, a positive correlation emerges when

expected information gain lags behind curiosity by 6 seconds.
Moreover, the regression line illustrated in Figure 7b shows
a positive correlation between the expected information gain
and the temporal derivative of curiosity at zero time lag. The
maximum correlation for this relationship occurs at a time
lag of -35 samples, with a correlation coefficient of -0.5821.
When considering the overall dataset from all participants, we
observed that the average maximum correlation (accounting
for both positive and negative correlations) occurs at a time
lag of -2.19 samples, which corresponds to approximately -
0.57 seconds. This indicates that, on average, curiosity tends
to precede expected information gain by about 0.57 seconds.
Thus, it is suggested that curiosity has a predictive role rep-
resented by expected information gain. Although the average
reaction time for a target detection task is approximately 0.454
seconds [48], which is faster than the observed lag in our study,
this discrepancy can be attributed to individual differences in
cognitive processing. Thus, our findings provide a reasonable
reaction time, especially in the context of curiosity-related
decision-making processes. Therefore, we can conclude that
the participant would upscale their curiosity when the expected
information gain increases (i.e., the environment becomes
unfamiliar).
D. Alternative Methods
The subjective reward method and the Q-learning method
are two alternative approaches to decoding the user’s decision-

option. (b) The subjective reward at each trial.
making process. The subjective reward method states that the
expected net utility Ut is computed by
Ut = dt × E[reward] + E[info], (6)
where dt indicates the desire for reward at trial t. Therefore,
instead of placing weight on the expected information gain
in the iFEP method, the subjective reward method assigns
weight to the expected reward. In the context of participants
performing navigation tasks in a VR environment, the desire
for reward would represent whether the participant would like
to experience cybersickness. Therefore, we would expect the
value of dt to be small. However, the average value of reward
intensity is 49.08, suggesting that the participant was not
motivated to avoid cybersickness (Figure 8b).
On the other hand, the Q-learning method predicts the
reward probability Q for action i using
Qi,t = Qi,t−1 + αt−1(rtai,t−1 − Qi,t−1), (7)
JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 8
where αt indicates the learning rate at trial t and ai,t indi-
cates the action selected at trial t. Also, the action selection
probability is determined by
P(ai,t = 1) = eβtQi,t
P
i eβtQi,t
, (8)
where βt indicates the inverse temperature at trial t and
controls the randomness of action selection. Appendix C
gives a detailed explanation of the formulation. Therefore,
to understand the relationship between inverse temperature
and action selection, we analyzed the correlation coefficient
between the expected information gain, inverse temperature,
and the derivative of inverse temperature at different time lags.
As shown in Figures 7c and 7d, there is a positive cor-
relation between the expected information gain and inverse
temperature (correlation coefficient = 0.8816 at time lag = 0)
and between the expected information gain and the temporal
derivative of inverse temperature (correlation coefficient =
0.8608 at time lag = 0).
V. D ISCUSSION
Our main objective was to model how curiosity and cyber-
sickness influence self-directed navigation in VR. We found
that: (1) users adopted predominantly conservative naviga-
tion strategies; (2) curiosity increased when the environment
changed; (3) iFEP-based estimation captured temporal trends
from behavioral data. Most prior research approaches user
interaction behavior through psychological or physiological
lenses [17], [18], [49]. We expand on these perspectives by
elucidating the dynamic influence of curiosity in shaping user
interactions within immersive environments.
Our results reveal that cybersickness significantly impacts
user decisions during navigation. While the model’s prediction
does not perfectly align with ground truth discomfort, it ef-
fectively captures temporal trends in increasing and decreasing
probabilities. The gradual nature of these changes may impact
prediction precision. Approximately 50% of participants re-
ported moderate to severe symptoms in SSQ, which is reflected
by the reductions in speed. Participants appeared to adjust
their strategies to mitigate discomfort, demonstrating self-
regulation behaviors. This finding aligns with prior studies on
task performance under discomfort [42], [43]. This suggests
that users implicitly manage their health state while navigating,
even without explicit instruction to do so. Moreover, par-
ticipants displayed diverse exploration tendencies, with most
people exhibiting conservative behavior likely influenced by
cybersickness. However, a subset of three participants, who
have a negligible or low SSQ score, showed high curiosity
and exploratory actions. These individual differences suggest
that curiosity-driven behavior is not solely determined by
discomfort, but may also be influenced by other factors worth
investigating in future studies.
Explaining the interplay between curiosity and cybersick-
ness in decision-making is complex, leaving multiple inter-
pretations of navigation patterns. First, the secondary task
may have distracted participants, exacerbating symptoms [4].
Participants often reduced movement speed during navigation,
suggesting an implicit health management strategy beyond the
primary task. Second, pre-exposure questionnaires indicated
that only 31.25% of participants reported frequent gaming
experience. This unfamiliarity with rapidly changing scenes
may have contributed to cybersickness, reducing willingness
to explore [23], [50]. Additionally, personality traits can shape
perception [51] and responses to novel scenarios [52], as
reflected in the trend toward negative curiosity (Figure 6f)
and cautious navigation patterns among most participants.
These findings emphasize the importance of examining cy-
bersickness’s influence on individual navigation behaviors,
particularly given its prevalence.
Our findings suggest some possible applications in VR
design. First, interpreting users’ internal states allows for
systems to adapt their design to respond dynamically to users’
discomfort in real-time, such as adjusting field of view [53]
and render parameters [54]. Also, curiosity can serve as an
indicator of engagement to stimulate or maintain user engage-
ment in systems designed for learning or training purposes
[55]. In addition, user profiling of navigation behavior can be
used to set default settings in VR systems [56]. Moreover,
our framework may serve as an indicative tool for evaluating
VR designs by continuously estimating user comfort and
engagement beyond subjective reports.
A. Practicality of alternative models
The subjective reward method emphasizes the expected
reward to model a reward-driven condition. In the context of
virtual navigation, this desire for reward reflects participants’
inclination to experience or avoid cybersickness. We antici-
pated that the reward intensity would be low, as participants
are likely motivated to avoid discomfort. However, the log
average reward intensity across all participants was 2.82.
The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were 0.28, 3.77, and
4.71, respectively, indicating a stronger-than-expected desire
for reward. Notably, only four participants exhibited a low
reward intensity, suggesting they were actively trying to avoid
cybersickness. This finding indicates that the subjective reward
method may not effectively explain user decision-making in
this scenario.
In contrast, the Q-learning method employs reinforcement
learning techniques to model adaptive reward-seeking behavior
by adjusting time-dependent meta-parameters, focusing exclu-
sively on maximizing expected cumulative rewards. As shown
in Figure 7c, the inverse temperature correlates with expected
information gain. Additionally, the majority of participants
demonstrated a positive correlation between expected cumu-
lative reward and inverse temperature. This result implies that
the randomness of action selection aligns with curiosity levels,
suggesting that the iFEP method is more suitable for decoding
user actions in a VR environment. Regarding the correlation
between expected information gain and the temporal derivative
of curiosity, results from seven participants showed a positive
correlation, two showed a negative correlation, and the remain-
ing seven exhibited no correlation. Given this variability, it is
difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the overall trend.

B. Limitations and future scope
By investigating the temporal balance between cybersick-
ness and curiosity based on users’ virtual navigation behav-
ior, we gain insights into the neural correlates of temporal
variability during immersion. However, we are aware that our
work may have some limitations. First, the short navigation
duration may limit accuracy. The result from the simulated
data revealed that longer trials yield more accurate predictions.
However, the improved estimation accuracy raises the risk of
severe sickness symptoms, complicating the user study [6].
Second, the use of a single forest environment allowed
control over spatial variables but may have favored certain user
preferences, potentially affecting engagement. Future work
should explore how environmental context and individual
differences (e.g., attention, stress) shape curiosity-driven be-
havior.
Third, we used a custom VR environment rather than open-
source benmarks, as many existing platforms involve passive
movement [57], multiplayer interaction [58], or game-like
objectives (e.g., coin collection [59], shooting tasks [60]) intro-
duce confounding factors. While our setting prioritizes natural
navigation and minimal cognitive load, we acknowledge that
standardized environments improve comparability.
Finally, other factors (e.g., immersion [61], cognitive dis-
traction [62], [63], and repeated exposure [64]) may influence
behavior but were not explicitly modeled, as we simplified
these interactions for modeling purposes in an early stage. Our
study included 4-5 day intervals between sessions, which may
limit the opportunity for the adaptation effect. Future research
should integrate additional physiological and cognitive data,
external stimuli, and larger samples to enhance robustness and
generalizability.
VI. C ONCLUSION
This research presents a computational framework for un-
derstanding how curiosity and cybersickness jointly influence
user behavior during virtual navigation. We find that most
users tend to adopt cautious exploratory strategies when expe-
riencing discomfort. The iFEP modeling reveals a strong link
between expected information gain and curiosity, demonstrat-
ing how users manage uncertainty and discomfort simultane-
ously.
Our findings highlight the importance of designing VR
systems that could respond to individual performance and en-
gagement. By modeling internal variables, we move closer to
user-centered design that enhances user experience, especially
in personalized learning, training, and entertainment within
immersive VR environments.
As immersive technologies advance, understanding the
tradeoffs between cognitive drives and sensory experience
is crucial. Future work can incorporate real-time adaptation
strategies that adjust interaction dynamics based on user state
estimation to provide timely feedback and enhance user expe-
rience.

APPENDIX A
EXPECTED NET UTILITY
This section provides the calculation process for the ex-
pected net utility according to [32] and [65]. The expected net
utility is calculated using
Ut(at+1) = E[rewardt+1] + ct × E[infot+1], (9)
where at is action and ct is curiosity intensity at trial t. In
addition, the cybersickness probability is influenced by the
latent cause w and the participant’s action a. Moreover, the
latent cause
wi,t = wi,t−1 + σw × ϵi,t, (10)
where σw is the noise intensity, ϵi,t is the standard Gaussian
noise, and i represents the option’s index ( i = 1 represents
the action Rest, and i = 2 represents the action Accelerate).
Therefore, the cybersickness probability is computed using
f(wi,t) = 1
1 + e−wi,t
. (11)
The participant’s recognition of the environment is represented
as the following equation [32]:
P(ot|wt, at) =
Y
i
h
f(wi,t)ot(1 − f(wi,t))1−ot
iai,t
, (12)
where ot ∈ {0, 1} represents whether cybersickness occurs
given the latent variable wt = (w1,t, w2,t)T and action at ∈ 
(1, 0)T , (0, 1)T 
at trial t. The Taylor series expansion for a
real and differentiable function f(x) at the point x = a is a
linear approximation at x = a, where
f(x) =
∞X
n=0
f(n)(a)
n! (x − a)n. (13)
Therefore, we obtain the following equation by applying the
2nd-order Taylor series expansion on equation (12):

Q(wt|φt) = N(wt|µt, Λ−1

the mean and Λt = diag(p1,t, p2,t) represents the precision.
Based on the participant’s desired probability of cybersickness
occurrence P0, the reward intensity is

Then, the expected reward (the first term of equation (9)) can
be formulated as follows:
E[rewardt+1] = EP(ot+1|at+1)[R(ot+1)]
=
X
i
P(ot+1|ai,t+1)R(ot+1). (16)
The expected information gain (the second term of equation
(9)) is computed using
E[infot+1]

h
DKL[Q(wt+1|ot+1, at+1)||Q(wt+1|at+1)]
i
= H(ot+1) − H(ot+1|wt+1), (17)
where Kullback-Leibler divergence ( DKL) measures the dif-
ference between probability distrbutions Q(wt+1|ot+1, at+1)
and Q(wt+1|at+1), also known as information gain [65]. The
first term H(ot+1) is the marginal entropy and the second term
H(ot+1|wt+1) is the conditional entropy. First, the marginal
entropy is
H(ot+1) = EP(ot+1|at+1)[−ln P(ot+1|at+1)]

. (18)
We substitute equation (14) into equation (18) to solve the
formula for the marginal entropy. The conditional entropy is
H(ot+1|wt+1) =
EP(ot+1|wt+1,at+1)Q(wt+1|at+1))[ln P(ot+1|wt+1, at+1)]

(19)
We obtain the above equation by substituting equation (12) to
H(0t+1|wt+1). Then, to approximate the value of conditional
entropy, we would use Taylor’s theorem. Let g(wi,t+1) =
f(wi,t+1) lnf(wi,t+1) + (1−f(wi,t+1)) ln(1−f(wi,t+1) and
apply the 2nd-order Taylor series expansion to it. Therefore,
we obtain

Afterward, we need to compute the value of curiosity. Assum-
ing that the curiosity varies at each trial and is influenced by
curiosity’s noise ζ, the formula of curiosity at trial t is:
ct = ct−1 + ϵc × ζt, (21)
where ϵc is the noise intenisty [32]. Therefore, by substituting
equations (18) and (20) into equation (17) we obtain the value
of the expected information gain. Finally, we attain the value
of the expected net utility by substituting the expected reward
(equation (16)), expected information gain (equation (17)) and
curiosity intensity (equation (21)) to equation (9).
APPENDIX B
CONFIDENCE
The confidence of cybersickness probability recognition is
γi,t = pi,t
f′(µi,t)2 , (22)
where f is the cybersickness probability and pi,t is the
precision of the probability distribution Q. Moreover, the value
of pi,t is updated according to:
pi,t = K−1
i,t + f(µi,t)(1 − f(µi,t)), (23)
and
Ki,t = σ2

APPENDIX C
THE Q-LEARNING METHOD
The Q-learning method uses the following action value
function to predict the reward obtained at trial t and choosing
action i:
Qi,t = Qi,t−1 + αt−1(rtai,t−1 − Qi,t−1), (25)
where αt represents the learning rate. Additionally, the soft-
max function
P(ai,t = 1) = eBtQi,t
P
i eBtQi,t
, (26)
where Bt represents the inverse temperature and controls the
randomness of action selection, is used to determine the action
selected by the participant. The learning rate and inverse
temperature values are calculated using behavioral data at
each time point. These parameters are assumed to change
temporally and follow
θt = θt−1 + ϵθ × ζθ,t, (27)
where θ ∈ {α, β}, ϵθ represents the noise intenisty, and ζθ,t
represents the white noise. This allows for adjustments based
on the participant’s actions and outcomes. Consequently, the
reward prediction at a given trial depends on the learning
rate, inverse temperature, and the predicted reward from the
previous trial.
