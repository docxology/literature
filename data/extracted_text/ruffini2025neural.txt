Abstract
Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related
information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for
it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this
computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and
slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a
cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces
intermodulation frequencies (of the form f +P a f ). It predicts that oscillation frequency
c i i
bands should be log-spaced (r ≳ 2–3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to
avoidspectraloverlap,asinconstant-Qfilterbanks,consistentwiththeobservedlogarithmic
spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ∼2–3). HAM’s log-uniform distribution
yieldsa1/f globalspectralprofileand1/fα sidebandspectrainthebroadband“aperiodic”

demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM),
where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator
(Janse-Rit). Through the network’s intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling,
amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel
circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to
observed spectral features of brain activity.

1 INTRODUCTION 4
1 Introduction
Predictive coding has emerged as a central framework for understanding neural processing,
positing that the brain continuously generates predictions about incoming sensory data and
updates these predictions by minimizing prediction errors.1,2 In the Free Energy Principle,
this hierarchical exchange of top-down predictions and bottom-up errors minimizes free en-
ergy.3,4 Kolmogorov Theory (KT) embeds this process within Algorithmic Information Theory,
suggesting that both biological brains and digital agents optimize predictions by constructing
compressive models of the world.5–10 All such information-centric proposals of brain function
fundamentally rely on encoding information in brain signals to compute prediction errors and
update internal representations.
Neural coding schemes have long been debated, with proposals ranging from rate coding (where
information is carried by average firing rates) to various temporal strategies—including spike
timing, synchrony, phase coding, and burst coding—to capture the richness of neural informa-
tion.11–13 In this context, it is increasingly clear that information is encoded not only in the
raw oscillatory signals but also in their amplitude envelopes.14 This dual coding strategy is
reminiscent of amplitude modulation (AM) in radio communications, where a high-frequency
carrier encodes information via its modulated envelope.15
In parallel, two empirical regularities stand out in neural field recordings: an aperiodic 1/fα
background and a near-logarithmic spacing of canonical oscillation bands. Both patterns recur
across species and recording modalities, and the aperiodic component can be cleanly separated
from periodic peaks in modern parameterizations.16–21
Oscillatoryactivityinthebrainnaturallysegregatesintofunctionalbands—suchasdelta,theta,
alpha, beta, and gamma. These canonical ‘bands’ should be understood as families of preferred
modes. Although not universally sharp peaks in raw Power Spectra Densities (PSDs), their
separability strengthens after accounting for the 1/f background or analyzing burst-wise dy-
namics, and their centers align with an geometric progression across circuits and species. They
exhibit a geometric progression with a common ratio r ≈ 2–3 (equivalently, equal spacing
on a log-frequency axis; constant-Q filterbank,18 see Figure 1). That is, the center frequen-
cies increase by a constant multiplier, or equivalently, they are evenly spaced when plotted
on a logarithmic scale.19,22 The reason for this spacing is unclear. A leading account is that
the approximately logarithmic (geometric) spacing emerges because a constant ratio between
bands lets excitability windows and integration times scale with the oscillation period, enabling
circuits with heterogeneous axonal/synaptic delays and sizes to coordinate; in this view, the
“family” of bands helps overcome delay-imposed processing limits.19 Complementarily, it has
been proposed that placing bands at equal distances on a log-frequency axis minimizes mutual
entrainment/cross-talk and reflects an underlying hierarchical network architecture.23
Itisbelievedthatoscillatoryactivityplaysakeyroleinorganizingandtransmittinginformation.
Gamma oscillations (30–100 Hz) have been implicated in local information processing, feature
binding, and communication through coherence,24–27 while slower rhythms (theta 4–8 Hz and
alpha 8–12 Hz) are associated with attentional gating and top-down signaling.28–30

1 INTRODUCTION 5
Figure 1.1: Logarithmic oscillatory hierarchy. Oscillation bands are approximately log-spaced
with an approximately common ratio r so that f = f /r (empirically r ≈ 2–3 between
k+1 k
neighboring bands).19 This approaches the theoretical limit of r ≳ 3 for non-overlapping side-
band clusters and is equivalent to equal spacing on a log-frequency axis (corresponding to a
constant-Q arrangement).
Slower oscillations, with longer periods, providea broad temporal window and allowintegration
over larger spatial extents with more variable synaptic delays, whereas faster oscillations offer
more precise, spatially limited representations of information. Such evidence reinforces the
notion that brain oscillations are organized into a conserved, hierarchical set of timescales, with
adjacent rhythm classes separated by roughly constant frequency ratios on the order of 2 to
3.19,19,20,22,31,32
In line with hierarchical processing concepts, such findings suggest that neural information pro-
cessing is inherently multiscale, with nested oscillatory hierarchies that multiplex information
much like modern communication systems. Gamma oscillations, in particular, serve as carri-
ers of sensory information, while slower rhythms modulate these carriers via cross-frequency
coupling. Motivated by this, we propose a hierarchical amplitude modulation (HAM) frame-
work to describe neural information encoding where information is represented in a layered
fashion: the raw oscillatory signal (the carrier), its amplitude envelope, and, recursively, the
envelope ofthat envelope. This nestedmodulation approachyields a coarse-grained, multiscale,
natural representation of information consistent with hierarchical predictive coding. As each
successive envelope captures fluctuations at a slower timescale, the system exhibits a logarith-
mic frequency spacing and power law of oscillatory dynamics—phenomena that align with the
observed geometric progression of brain rhythms.

2 Hierarchical amplitude modulation (HAM)
2.1 Construction
In standard amplitude modulation (AM) (as used in radio), information is encoded in the
amplitude of a high-frequency carrier wave. For example, an audio signal m(t) (low-frequency
information) can modulate a higher-frequency carrier C(t) = A cos(2πf t) by varying the
c c
carrier’s amplitude in proportion to m(t). The result is a modulated signal
S(t) = A [1+am(t)] cos(2πf t), (2.1)
c c
where a is the modulation index (chosen so that 1+am(t) > 0 to avoid distortion). Demod-
ulation of S(t) recovers the original message m(t) by detecting the envelope. In neural terms,
one can think of fast oscillations (e.g., gamma rhythms) acting as carriers whose amplitudes are
controlled by slower processes (e.g., theta or delta rhythms).
While classical AM involves a single modulating signal (Fig. 2.1), the brain exhibits nested os-
cillations: faster rhythms modulated by slower rhythms, which in turn are modulated by even
slower fluctuations. Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM) generalizes the AM concept to
multiple layers of amplitude modulation across different frequency bands. In a HAM cascade,
a high-frequency oscillation’s amplitude is modulated by a slower oscillation; this slower os-
cillation’s amplitude can itself be modulated by an even slower process; and so on, creating a
multilevelenvelopehierarchy. Ineffect, informationcanbecarriednotonlybythefast“carrier”
signal, but also by its envelope, the envelope-of-envelope, etc., forming a multiscale encoding
of information. Not all frequencies need to be involved in a cascade, but all such combinations
should be possible.

using the trigonometric identity cosA cosB = 1[cos(A+B)+cos(A−B)] iteratively yields a

This multiplicative, multiband structure is illustrated in Figure 2.2. A high-frequency carrier
(Fig. 2.2, top) is successively modulated by a slower oscillation, then by an even slower one,
and so on, producing a final complex signal with amplitude fluctuations at multiple timescales

decays at lower frequencies, reflecting how each envelope layer contributes a factor m < 1 to

the amplitude (as discussed below). The nested HAM signal can be demodulated in stages to
recover the slower envelope signals from the faster carrier, analogous to how a radio receiver
detects a single AM envelope – but here performed iteratively across scales.
2.2 Avoiding spectral overlap
A critical challenge in any multi-layer modulation is avoiding spectral overlap between com-
ponents. If the newly generated sideband frequencies crowd into neighboring frequency bands,
informationatdifferentlayerswouldinterfere,anddemodulationwouldnotbepossible. Inengi-
neered communication systems, this is solved by allocating guard bands and using a constant-Q

and quickly saturating at r = 3 for deeper modulation layers (see Figure A.2 in Appendix A).
Geometric spacing (log-uniform in frequency) ensures that each modulation’s sidebands fit into
the “gaps” between adjacent bands without overlap if r is large enough. Then, the bands
behave like well-separated narrow channels. In practice, neural oscillations exhibit r ≈ 2–3
(e.g., delta ∼2–4 Hz, theta ∼6–8 Hz, alpha ∼10 Hz, etc.), which provides adequate separation
for finite-depth or weak modulation. This log-spaced, constant-Q arrangement mirrors classical
wavelet filter banks and the cochlear frequency, and it matches the empirical observation of
near-logarithmic spacing in canonical brain rhythm bands.
Crucially, the log-spaced hierarchy means each oscillatory “band” retains its identity (its own
frequency range) even as it participates in a larger modulation cascade. By keeping modulation
depths m moderate (m < 1), each layer’s sidebands remain as small perturbations around
i i
the existing lines. This avoids excessive distortion and allows the original carrier and envelope
signals to be separated by bandpass filtering or sequential demodulation. In summary, HAM’s

a 1/fα spectrum with α tuned by neuronal parameters (e.g., modulation strengths and band
spacing). We will discuss these two routes next in more detail.

are indicated in the legend. Because generator density per Hz declines roughly as 1/f under
log spacing, the aggregate PSD decays with frequency; AM sidebands add a low-f pedestal but
preserve the 1/f backbone in the interior.
Global Spectrum
An immediate result from the geometric scaling architecture is power law spectral scaling. As
shown in Appendix A.2, a bank of log-spaced oscillators with equal power per band produces
S(f) ≈ 1/f. Morevoer, random AM pairings add a constant pedestal; stronger modulation (m)
or more pairs increase κ and flatten the fitted α over finite windows. Finally, using constant-Q

range. Theassumptionρ(f) ∝ 1/f parallelsempiricallogarithmic spacing ofneuralbands19 and

We tested the prediction that a log-spaced hierarchy of oscillatory generators produces a per-Hz
power density that decays with frequency on a linear axis (reflecting the decreasing generator
density per Hz), and that the aggregate spectrum approaches a power law on a log–log axis
(see Figure 2.3). We defined a frequency band structure using the set of Penttonen–Buzs´aki

Sideband Spectrum. A furtherconsequence ofthe HAM cascade is theemergenceof power-
law scaling in the sideband spectrum. Because each modulation layer redistributes a fraction
of the signal’s power to lower frequencies, the overall spectral density tends to decline with
frequencyinascale-free(fractal-like)manner. Infact,underlog-spacing,asimpleanalysisshows
that the power spectral density of a hierarchical cascade approximately follows P(f) ∼ 1/fα
– a 1/f-type law – with the exponent α depending on the modulation depth (m) and spacing
ratio (r).
For intuition, consider an idealized case where every layer uses the same depth m and ratio
r for clarity. The first modulation produces sidebands carrying a fraction ∼ (m/2)2 of the
carrier power (since each first-order sideband has amplitude ≈ m/2 of the carrier). The next
modulation layer acts on those sidebands, generating second-order components of order (m/2)2
times the first layer’s amplitude, i.e., (m/2)4 relative to the original carrier’s amplitude, and so
on. After k layers, the characteristic frequency has decreased to f ≈ f /rk, and the power at

that scale is suppressed by roughly (m/2)2k relative to the top. Quantitatively, one can show

This indicates a 1/fα scaling of the cascade’s spectrum. Notably, α increases as m decreases
(weaker modulation yields a steeper spectral drop-off) and α decreases as r increases (wider
band gaps flatten the spectrum). Figure 2.4 illustrates this relationship: stronger modulation
(larger m) or broader spacing (larger r) results in a shallower slope (smaller α), whereas small
m leads to a pronounced 1/fα fall-off.
Thus, the emergence of 1/fα spectral structure in hierarchical AM systems is explained by two
minimal structural constraints: (1) a log-spaced distribution of oscillators and (2) a modulation
rule enforcing f < f . Sidebands are not necessary for scale-free behavior but do enhance

tionally, AM at slow–fast interfaces is consistent with cross-frequency coupling accounts of
computation/communication52,53 and with nonlinear mixing known from RF/microwave sys-
tems.54
We next examine a single LaNMM column to evaluate how it can encode (modulate), demod-
ulate and decode a message via HAM. See Figure 3.1 bottom for the spectra of the P1 and P2
membrane potentials (code for the example is provided at Github).
Modulation. In the example in Figure 3.1, an external slow oscillatory input in the alpha
band (mimicking a “prior” or top-down signal) was injected into the deep-layer pyramidal pop-
ulation P1 while the superficial layer P2 was configured to produce a sustained fast oscillation.
The slow input modulates the fast oscillation in P2. In this example, the correlation between
external input and P1 was ∼0.52, between P1 and P2 envelope ∼0.98, and between input and
P2 envelope ∼0.51.
Modulation can be undone. It has been recently shown that the LaNMM provides a candidate
mechanism for the neural function of error evaluation—central to predictive coding—by com-
paring modulated signals across cortical layers.14 This implementation of error evaluation is in
fact a demonstration of modulation removal — v. Fig. 7 in Ruffini et al. (2025).14 Modulation
removal (or error evaluation) is successfully carried out by providing an appropriate prior sign-
reversed version of the modulating signal. The incoming slow-band-modulated high-frequency
carrier is “unmodulated” by an incoming slow signal with the right signal shape (a sign shift
with respect to the high-frequency envelope). Prediction with the right prior demodulates the
incoming bottom-up signal, leaving only the carrier.
Second and higher order modulation can be implemented in different ways. One is to again use
the modulation approach above, but with a LaNMM model in which the P1 population has a
slower natural frequency. P1 can then be driven by an appropriate slower signal. The other is
to use envelope-envelope coupling as discussed in Ruffini et al (2025),14 where it was used to
encode precision in predictive coding.
Demodulation (envelope extraction). Finally, it is important to be able to extract the
envelope of processed signals (the message). This can be achieved with the architecture de-
scribed in Figure 3.1 (b). In our implemented example, we find that the carrier envelope can

Oscillations in the brain. Oscillations are ubiquitous in neural systems and organize com-
putation across space and time.20,22,55,56 Slow rhythms (delta–alpha/beta) tend to coordi-
nate large-scale context and top-down control (feedback), whereas faster beta/gamma rhythms
carry local content and bottom-up (feedforward) signals; laminar and inter-areal physiology
support this spectral dissociation.39,42,57–59 In macaque visual cortex, for example, inter-areal
Granger-causality in the gamma band is stronger in the feedforward direction (V1 → V4),
while alpha-beta influences dominate in the feedback direction (V4 → V1). This aligns with
anatomical projections: feedforward pathways originate in superficial layers (rich in gamma)

and target layer 4 of upstream areas, whereas feedback pathways arise from deep layers (rich
in alpha/beta) and target superficial layers60). The result is a frequency-based routing of in-
formation, consistent with predictive coding models: fast gamma rhythms convey unexpected
input (prediction errors) up the hierarchy, and slower alpha/beta rhythms convey predictions
or contextual feedback down.55 Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) provides the bridge between
these scales, with slow phases modulating fast-band envelopes and timing.13,52
Across EEG/MEG/ECoG and intracranial recordings, canonical rhythm classes (delta, theta,
alpha, beta, gamma) occur at progressively higher center frequencies whose separations are
roughlyconstantonalog–frequencyaxis. Inpractice, adjacentbandsaretypicallyseparatedby
a factor of about two to three (e.g., θ∼4–7Hz, α∼8–12Hz, β∼15–30Hz, γ∼40–80Hz), yield-
ing an approximately geometric hierarchy of timescales.18,19,22,28,29,55 Penttonen and Buzs´aki
explicitly quantified near–log spacing in rodents;19 convergent human and non-human primate
reviews and textbooks report comparable band centers and boundaries, which imply ratios
r ≈ 2–3 between neighboring classes.22,28,29,55 Methodological work that separates periodic
peaks from the aperiodic background further confirms that these peaks recur at roughly loga-
rithmic intervals across individuals and tasks.18
Recent frequency-tagging work makes this hierarchy directly observable: when two inputs are
presented at distinct tagging rates, neural responses exhibit intermodulation (IM) components
at sums and differences of the tags—clear fingerprints of multiplicative mixing/demodulation
predicted by HAM. This has been leveraged in steady-state visual paradigms to probe inte-
gration and attention.61 Comprehensive reviews document robust IM sidebands across visual
cognition 50 and characterize their generators and applications 51. In our framework, these side-
bands arise naturally from envelope–carrier architectural interactions: slow predictive rhythms
(alpha/theta) multiplicatively gate fast carriers (beta/gamma), yielding IM structure around
eachbandcenterwhilepreservingseparabilityunderapproximatelogarithmicspacing(constant-
Q). This same logic explains why, after constant-Q preprocessing, both periodic peaks and an
aperiodic 1/fα backbone can be read without mutual bias.17,18
Computation with oscillators. Beyond description, oscillations can compute. Analog and
hybrid models use coupled oscillators as primitives for signal processing and decision dynam-
ics.62 A broader theory and hardware stack for computing with oscillators now connects phase,
frequency, and amplitude modulation to classification, constraint satisfaction, and optimiza-
tion 63. In AI, recurrent oscillator reservoirs (e.g., Kuramoto-type networks) provide nonlinear
fading-memory dynamics and rich readouts for sequence learning and control.64,65 This may
provide a route to the large energy savings realized in computational biological systems com-
pared to artificial ones.66 Converging theory in systems neuroscience argues that the neocortex
itself employs recurrent oscillator networks whose computational capacity depends on the pat-
terning and heterogeneity of local oscillators—and that increasing heterogeneity (while avoid-
ing overlap) enhances separability and pushes the network toward powerful operating regimes
near criticality.67 Large-scale modeling further shows how oscillatory motifs implement rout-
ing, working-memory control, and flexible task switching, with function tied to band-specific
coupling and multiplexing 66.

4 DISCUSSION 16
HAMfitssquarelywithinthiscomputationalview: itrequires oscillatorheterogeneityandbene-
fitsfromlog-uniform(constant-Q)spacingtopreventIMcollisions,enablinglayeredmodulation
/demodulation pipelines across the cortex. In practice, this predicts that (i) modest increases
in frequency diversity should improve multiplexed readout, and (ii) approximately logarithmic
spacing maximizes usable channel capacity—two testable signatures in laminar/ECoG/MEG
experiments and neuromorphic oscillator arrays. In HAM, relatively fast rhythms serve as
carriers whose amplitudes are multiplicatively structured by slower processes; staged demodu-
lation then makes these envelopes readable downstream. This implements a neural analog of
multi-layer AM in communication engineering, but realized in laminar circuits.
From analog/digital representations to hierarchical envelopes. Information in engi-
neered systems may be encoded digitally (symbolic, discrete) or analogically (continuous wave-
forms). Neural systems are fundamentally analog at the field level, with information carried
both by oscillatory signals themselves and by their amplitude envelopes—the latter being a
natural vehicle for slow context that modulates faster content.22 Auditory ECoG demon-
strates this duality: high-gamma envelopes track the stimulus envelope and support direct
speech reconstruction.68,69 HAM formalizes a coarse-to-fine organization in which informa-
tion can reside in the signal and in successive envelopes (envelope-of-envelope, etc.), yielding
a principled multi-scale code. Debates on neural coding (rate, temporal/ spike-timing, phase,
and burst codes) converge on the view that multiple encoding schemes coexist and are multi-
plexed across scales.11–13 In this light, HAM specifies one concrete way slow rhythms coordi-
nate fast content: theta/alpha phases gate gamma-band carriers (rate/temporal information)
via gain control, with nested envelopes enabling compositional, layered messages. This aligns
with“communication-through-coherence”andthespectraldissociationoffeedforward/feedback
pathways.55,57,58 More broadly, oscillator-based computation is increasingly recognized as a vi-
able computing paradigm; HAM connects that literature to cortical field dynamics.63,66,67
A rationale for log spacing. Intermodulation at each stage produces sideband clusters
around every center frequency. Avoiding spectral collisions across levels requires the span of
slower combinations to fit inside the guard band of faster clusters. A strict super-increasing
hierarchy f > 2P f suffices to keep clusters disjoint; geometric spacing f = f /r
k j>k j k+1 k
satisfies this with margin for r ≳ 2–3 and yields constant fractional bandwidths (constant-Q),
making demodulation scale-invariant and mirroring classical filterbanks and cochlear tiling.36
The minimal ratio depends on the number of modulating layers (r = 2 is the minimum for a
single carrier/modulator AM arrangement, see Figure A.2 and Appendix A for details). Exact
ratios are not essential—a weaker non-overlap inequality already pushes the ensemble toward a
log-uniform density of centers. Empirically, r ≈ 2–3 lies near the theoretical r > 2–3 threshold,
explaining why real bands show limited but tolerable overlap.
Two routes to the aperiodic 1/fα. HAM predicts 1/fα via two complementary mech-
anisms. (i) Cascade route: with log spacing and small, quasi-uniform modulation depth m,

4 DISCUSSION 17
Mixture route: a log-uniform bank of narrowband (constant-Q) oscillators already yields ∼ 1/f
in expectation (equal power per octave). Random AM pairings preserve this backbone in the
interior but induce predictable edge deviations: a small-difference pedestal at low f and a
finite-support roll-off at high f. Analysis choices (edges; constant-Hz vs. constant-Q smooth-
ing) determine whether fitted αˆ flattens or steepens over finite windows.17,18
Mechanistic implementation. Here we provided an implementation proof-of-concept of
amplitude modulation in the LaNMM, with base frequencies in the alpha and gamma bands,
although other frequencies can be implemented in this model14 and related ones70 by adjusting
parameters. In LaNMM, PING-like fast generators and JR-like slow generators map naturally
onto “carrier” and “envelope” roles, with demodulation operationalized by analytic-signal en-
velopes.49 These choices are consistent with laminar spectral asymmetries—gamma favoring
feedforward content and alpha/beta favoring feedback predictions.57,58 The generation of other
frequencies may involve larger-scale mechanisms, e.g., thalamo-cortical loops, but neural mass
models have been proposed for most of the canonical bands (see Table A.1.
Predictions. A core prediction of multiplicative envelopes besides approximate geometric
spacing is intermodulation arithmetic: sum/difference terms (f ± f , 2f ± f , ...) should
1 2 1 2
emerge when two tagged inputs interact nonlinearly or when demodulation occurs. This is
precisely what steady-state visual paradigms report and exploit.51,61 Intermodulation compo-
nents (IMs) are now used to assay integrative neural mechanisms from low- to high-level vision,
attention, andmultisensorybinding, strengtheningthecaseforHAM-likeprocessing50. Inlam-
inar circuits, HAM further predicts superficial carrier-dominant activity coexisting with deeper
envelope-dominantreadouts, andcross-frequencycoupling, matchingreportedinteractions.57,58
HAM makes direct, perturbation-level predictions. (i) Spacing: approximately geometric spac-
ing should minimize cluster collisions and facilitate staged demodulation. (ii) IM scaling: the
amplitude of IM terms scales with products of modulation depths, providing a calibration han-
dle in frequency-tagged designs. (iii) Laminar dissociation: superficial layers should carry fast
carriers; deeper layers should track their envelopes in prediction-heavy contexts. (iv) Perturba-
tions: reducingaslowrhythm’samplitudeshouldreducetheenvelopevarianceoffasteractivity
it modulates (steepening the PSD), whereas entraining a slow rhythm should increase that vari-
ance (flattening the PSD). These can be tested with closed-loop stimulation and preregistered
laminar/ECoG/MEG paradigms, coupled to LaNMM-based parameter inference to link con-
trolled changes in m and r to shifts in α. Constant-Q preprocessing and explicit separation of
periodic vs. aperiodic components are essential to stabilize slope estimates and avoid spurious
CFC.18
Relation to alternative accounts. Multiple mechanistic routes can yield the observed
near–logarithmic spacing of brain rhythms and their cross-frequency interactions. One line
argues that approximately logarithmic spacing follows from hierarchical anatomy and finite
conduction delays, whereby integration windows scale with the oscillation period, allowing
circuits with heterogeneous axonal/synaptic delays and sizes to coordinate.71 In this view,

4 DISCUSSION 18
faster rhythms remain local while larger networks synchronize more slowly, consistent with
evolutionary preservation of a hierarchy of timescales and size-invariant timing,32 and with a
posterior–anterior cortical frequency gradient in humans.72 Whole-brain models further show
that realistic, distance-dependent delays can generate alpha-band phase networks.73 Comple-
mentarily, spacing as equal steps on a log-frequency axis has been argued to minimize mutual
entrainment/cross-talkandtoreflecthierarchicalnetworkarchitecture—showninreverse-engineered
networks that reproduce log-spaced spectral peaks.23 Recent formal work refines this optimiza-

orypositsthatcross-frequencyinteractionsaregovernedbytwoprinciples—phase–to–amplitude
(envelope) modulation and phase–phase (harmonic) coupling—applied to brain and body oscil-
lations arranged on a 1:2 ladder.31
A parallel mechanistic route is self-organization: with activity-dependent plasticity, neural
populations can split into a few frequency clusters whose slower envelopes modulate faster
components, offering a circuit basis for band “quantization”.75–77 Methodologically, the ap-
parent discreteness strengthens after modeling out the aperiodic 1/f background and analyzing
burst-wisedynamics—revealingapproximatelyconstant-Qspacingofputativepeaks18—andre-
cent state-space reconstructions report a low-dimensional geometric “core” that organizes band
interactions78). ’
Additionally, a large literature treats slow phases modulating fast-band amplitudes (PAC) and
related CFC as a control mechanism that routes information and coordinates computations
across scales.52 Laminar and inter-areal data support a spectral dissociation of feedforward vs.
feedback: gamma/theta dominate feedforward, alpha/beta feedback;57,79 large-scale/laminar
modeling reproduces these asymmetries,45 and a recent laminar atlas shows ubiquitous deep
(alpha-beta)/superficial (gamma) motifs across primates.80
HAM differs from the above by proposing a compositional information-encoding scheme and by
focusing on its consequences for oscillatory spectral structure. It does not derive the spacing
primarily from biophysical delays or carrier interference-avoidance; instead, it treats the band
hierarchy as a normative, codebook-like quantization that supports clean, scale-invariant multi-
plexingunderexplicitconstraints,withspecificmultiplicativeschemesandfalsifiablepredictions
about when/where centers can shift while preserving constant-Q structure. Our results show
how nested envelopes can carry specific information and yield testable spectral consequences.
HAM starts from the central role of amplitude modulation but generalizes the spacing: inter-
modulationsidebandsimposeguard-bandconstraintsthataresatisfiedbyany approximatelyge-
ometric (constant-Q) spacing with ratio r ≳ 2-3. It also offers a constructive path to fractal-like
spectra by structurally favoring criticality. It is compatible with signatures of near-critical
dynamics (avalanches, scale-invariant correlations). Combining HAM, time-constant, or E–I
explanations will require perturbational tests and careful finite-size controls—not spectral fits
alone.81,82

4 DISCUSSION 19
Finally, prior work in signal processing has noted that constant-Q (log-spaced) filterbanks with
equal power per octave imply an overall 1/f (“pink-noise”) backbone, and that cascade con-
structions(e.g.,mixturesofrelaxationtimesormultiplicativecascades)naturallygenerate1/fα
spectra.36,81,83–86 We place that in a neural context and further link it to predictive coding
dynamics(withdeeplayersmodulatingsuperficiallayers). HAMcanbeviewedasamechanistic
complement to descriptive models of 1/f noise (e.g., fractional Gaussian noise, self-organized
criticality). Rather than assuming an ad hoc fractal process, HAM builds 1/f from interact-
ing oscillatory components with clear physiological mapping. Beyond qualitative arguments for
1/f, HAMderivestwomechanisticroutes—(i)amultiplicativecascadelinkingslopeαtomodu-
lation depth m and spacing r, and (ii) a mixture route from aggregating log-spaced narrowband
oscillators.18
Predictive coding link. HAM provides a hierarchical information encoding backbone for
predictive coding. As proposed in Ruffini et al. (2025),14 in hierarchical predictive coding, deep
populations provide slow predictions p (t) while superficial populations carry content in their
k
envelopes. Error evaluation at level k is essentially carried out by a signed demodulation:
ε (t) = D (cid:2) x(t)(cid:3) − p (t), (4.1)

where x(t) is the bottom-up signal, p (t) the prediction for the k-th layer, and D stands for
k
demodulation at frequency f — i.e., envelope extraction followed by subtraction (the “Com-
k
parator”). Laminar data support this mapping: gamma-band activity dominates feedforward
channelsandalpha/betaenvelopesdominatefeedback,consistentwithdeep-layerenveloperead-
out and staged demodulation across the hierarchy.57,58 Thus, modulation order is immaterial
(productstructure),whereasunmodulationshouldproceedfast→slow(orinparallelconstant-Q

casts (see Appendix A.1).
Outlook. Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation offers a coherent explanation linking multiple
scales of neural dynamics. By requiring logarithmic frequency spacing and limited modulation
depth, HAM ensures that oscillatory bands can nest without losing their identity, providing
a multi-layer carrier for information. The framework elegantly accounts for the origin of 1/f
spectra as a consequence of either deep cascades or aggregated log-oscillators. It connects to
laminar circuit anatomy, suggesting that the cortex’s layered structure is not just a feedfor-
ward/feedback arrangement but also a modulation pipeline for neural signals. There are many
avenues to build on this work: incorporating more realistic spiking dynamics, exploring how
noise and oscillations interplay in HAM (since external noise could either disrupt or be filtered
by such a system), and extending to other frequency domains (e.g., could very slow < 1 Hz fluc-
tuations modulate high-frequency oscillations across brain-wide networks?). The HAM model
provides clear predictions and a language to discuss how the brain’s rhythms might interact to
encode information. As neuroscience moves toward understanding the brain as a multi-scale
communications network, HAM may provide a valuable piece of the puzzle, bridging theories
from engineering with the biological reality of brain oscillations.

A APPENDIX: MATHEMATICAL DETAILS 28
A Appendix: Mathematical details
AM radio operates by encoding information in the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier wave.
In this context, “information” typically refers to the audio signal we want to transmit, such
as music or voice. This information is represented as a low-frequency signal, which modulates
or varies the amplitude of the high-frequency carrier wave. The carrier itself oscillates at
a frequency much higher than the signal, enabling it to be transmitted over long distances
efficiently. During modulation, the carrier’s amplitude is adjusted to follow the waveform of the
audio signal, embedding the desired information within the carrier’s envelope. When received,
this combined signal undergoes demodulation to extract the original audio information from
the carrier. Demodulation detects variations in amplitude and reconstructs the original low-
frequency signal. This process highlights how AM radio relies on distinct components: a steady
carrier,themodulatinginformationsignal,anddemodulationtorecovertheoriginalinformation
for playback. The carrier signal C(t) can be expressed as C(t) = A cos(2πf t), where A is
c c c
the amplitude of the carrier, and f is the carrier frequency. To encode the information, the
c
amplitude of the carrier is varied according to the lower-frequency information signal m(t),
producing the modulated signal S(t),
S(t) = A (cid:2)1+am(t)(cid:3)cos(cid:0)2πf t (cid:1) , (A.1)
c c
where am(t) is scaled such that 1 + am(t) remains positive, ensuring no distortion occurs
during modulation. Here, A is the carrier amplitude, a is the modulation index, m(t) is the
c
baseband (modulating) signal with frequency content up to f ≪ f , and f is the carrier
m c c
frequency. This generic model subsumes both single-tone AM (where m(t) = cos(2πf t)) and
m
multi-tone/wideband modulations, as long as the maximum modulating frequency is less than
f . At the receiver, a demodulation process retrieves the original information signal m(t) by
c
detecting variations in the amplitude (or envelope) of S(t).
While standard AM encoding relies on a single layer of modulation, where the information
signal m(t) modulates the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier, this concept can be extended
to a hierarchical framework in which multiple layers of modulation occur at different timescales
(HAM. In HAM, each modulating signal not only modifies the carrier but also modulates the
envelope of another modulating signal at a slower timescale, forming a cascade of amplitude
modulations across hierarchical frequency bands.
A.1 HAM and logarithmic spacing of modulating bands
Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM) refers to a nested modulation scheme in which a
high-frequencycarrierisamplitude-modulatedbyasignal,whoseamplitudeinturnismodulated
by another slower signal, and so on across multiple layers. In essence, information is encoded at
multiple hierarchical levels of the amplitude envelope. We describe this concept step by step,
analyze the resulting spectra at each stage, and show why a logarithmic (geometric) spacing of
carrier and modulation frequencies naturally emerges to prevent spectral overlap, as observed
in electrophysiological signals19,22 (see Figure 1). Finally, we discuss general insights into how

Definition (single HAM cascade). In neural circuits, there is no singled-out “carrier”. We
therefore treat the fastest oscillator as any other building block in a multiplicative cascade

Log spacing in (A.8) affords constant-Q filtering — meaning each band’s Q = centerfrequency is

provides a standard implementation of amplitude extraction at each stage.49
This hierarchical modulation structure results in nested envelopes that impose amplitude fluc-
tuationsatdifferenttimescales. Asseeninthegeneratedhierarchicalmodulationplots(seeFig-
ure 2.2), a low-frequency modulator introduces a broad envelope variation, a higher-frequency
modulator superimposes faster oscillations within that envelope, and so forth. The final sig-
nal thus encapsulates a multi-timescale structure where rapid oscillations are embedded within
progressively slower amplitude modulations.
Bandwidth and modulation index considerations: In a multi-layer design, each modu-
lation layer k will effectively use up a certain bandwidth around each spectral line it modulates.
Ifm islarge(deepmodulation), thesidebandscarrymorepowerandonemightallowaslightly

tral lines. Thus, typically one keeps m ≤ 1 and often m ≪ 1 for higher layers so that those
k k
sidebandsremainsmallandconfined. Theno-overlapconditionimposesatrade-off: higher-layer
modulations can occupy only a fraction of the spacing left by the layer above.
Natural systems that exhibit hierarchical oscillations appear to enforce the m < 1 principle
to maintain functional integrity. The brain produces many oscillatory nested rhythms (delta,
theta, alpha, beta, gamma, etc.). Maintaining m < 1 in these neural modulations preserves
well-separated oscillatory bands. Each brainwave band retains its characteristic frequency
range and identity, which is important if different bands are to carry separable information
streams.
In summary, overmodulation is avoided in both engineered HAM systems and natural oscilla-
tory hierarchies because it leads to distortion and loss of information. The condition m < 1
keeps each modulation layer linear and the overall signal decomposable into distinct frequency
components.

Full spectrum. Next, we model a random ensemble of logarithmic oscillators interacting
via modulation. Consider an ensemble of narrowband oscillators with center frequencies f ∈
[F ,F ]. Assume (i) log-uniform center density ρ(f) = C/f (equal expected number per
min max
log-frequency bin, i.e., equal energy per octave), where C = [ln(F /F )]−1; (ii) each os-

cillator contributes the same unit power, shaped by a unit-area spectral kernel K (·) that
ε
is narrow relative to its center (ideally constant-Q, i.e., fractional bandwidth approximately
constant across f).Equal energy per octave ⇒ pink noise (1/f) is a classical result in au-
dio/time–frequency analysis; constant-Q filterbanks formalize this logarithmic tiling.

Intuition. Convolving a slowly varying density ρ with a narrow kernel evaluates ρ locally. With
ρ(f) ∝ 1/f, equal oscillator mass per octave gives a pink (1/f) baseline.
We now assume that the oscillators are coupled randomly as carrier and modulator (second-
order pairing). We draw unordered pairs (f ,f ) i.i.d. from ρ with the AM constraint f < f .

Finite-range and bandwidth effects. (i) Finite support [F ,F ] produces curvature

width (e.g., Gaussian σ = 0.5Hz) is not constant-Q and biases the high-frequency region.
Adopting σ = ηf (fractional width) restores scale invariance and improves linearity of log–log
fits. These two points explain why, in our simulation, log-spaced centers produce a clear 1/f
(α ≈ 1.0) without sidebands, while adding sidebands slightly reduces the fitted α (constant
pedestal added), as observed in Fig. 2.3.
Does geometric spacing matter for the 1/f law? The derivation of S(f)∼1/f relies
only on the density of oscillator centers ρ(f), not on exact geometric ratios. Geometric spacing
(f = f /r) yields ρ(f) ∝ 1/f exactly, but any monotone sequence that satisfies the super-

The cumulative count of oscillators above frequency f is therefore

N(f) = #{k : f > f} ≈ max ,
k ⟨logr⟩
so the differential density is

ρ(f) = − = .

Hence, any super-increasing sequence with bounded ratios and finite ⟨logr⟩ yields an approx-
imately log-uniform distribution of oscillator centers. The strict geometric case (r ≡ r) is
k
a special instance where ρ(f) = C/f exactly. Thus, the weaker non-overlap condition suf-
fices—geometric spacing merely provides a clean analytical form. Thus, geometric spacing is
a sufficient but not necessary condition; the weaker non-overlap constraint already implies an
asymptotically log-uniform distribution and therefore the same 1/f scaling in expectation —
geometric spacing merely provides a clean analytical form.
As we saw, for a single multiplicative cascade with geometric spacing r > 1 and modulation
depth m, the toy analysis gives P(f) ∼ f−α with α = 2ln(2/m)/lnr (derived earlier). That
mechanism ties α to (r,m) within one chain. By contrast, the population mixture mechanism
above yields α ≈ 1 from the log-spaced distribution of centers alone, even without sidebands.
Bothmechanismscancoexistinneuraldata; carefulparameterizationisneededtoseparateape-
riodic from oscillatory peaks.On disentangling aperiodic and periodic structure, see Donoghue
et al. (2020).21 Other accounts of 1/fα (mixtures of timescales, synaptic filtering, E/I balance,
etc.) are reviewed in B´edard & Destexhe (2009) and Milotti (2002).81
In summary, (1) A bank of log-spaced oscillators with equal power per band produces S(f) ≈
1/f. (2) Random AM pairings add a constant pedestal; stronger modulation (m) or more pairs
increase κ and flatten the fitted α over finite windows. (3) Using constant-Q kernels (or filters)
0
should push the fitted slope in Fig. 1 toward α ≈ 1 and increase the fitting range. The assump-
tion ρ(f) ∝ 1/f parallels empirical logarithmic spacing of neural bands (delta→gamma)19 and
is mathematically equivalent to a constant-Q tiling (equal spacing on a log-frequency axis).36

match the staged fast→slow recovery to first order.

Terminology: guard-bands, spacing, and non-overlap
Terminology.
• Non-overlap (default meaning). Throughout the paper, “non-overlap” means
Guard–Band Non–Overlap (GBNO):
f >
2X
f ∀k.
k j
j>k
Under geometric spacing, i.e., f = f /r, this is equivalent to r > 2–3.
k+1 k
• Weaker condition. The Super–Increasing (SI) hierarchy
X
f > f ∀k
k j
j>k
(geometric case f = f /r ⇒ r > 2) prevents slower combinations from reaching f
k+1 k k
but does not guarantee that the downward spread of the kth sideband cluster cannot
overlap the upward spread of the (k+1)st. Hence SI is insufficient for strict cluster
separation and uniqueness of signed combinations.
• Geometric/log spacing and constant-Q. We use geometric spacing (f = f /r)
k+1 k
to describe log-uniform centers and a constant-Q tiling. When we discuss theoretical
guarantees (non-overlap, uniqueness, staged demodulation), we state r > 2–3. When
wedescribeempiricalbands,westater ≈ 2–3andnotethatmodestoverlapcanappear
in practice for finite depth and small modulation.
Demodulation requirement.
• Sequential demodulation without interference assumes GBNO (r > 2–3 under geome-
try), so that each carrier’s sideband cluster is disjoint from adjacent clusters.
• When referring to “adequate separation” in simulations or data where depth is finite
and modulation is moderate (m < 1), we may note that SI (r > 2) can suffice opera-
tionally, but we reserve the term “non-overlap” strictly for GBNO.
Summary of statements.
• Theory: Cluster non-overlap (GBNO) requires f > 2P f ∀k, i.e., f =
k j>k j k+1
f /r ⇒ r > 2–3.
k
• Weaker statement: The super-increasing hierarchy f > P f ∀k (geometric:
k j>k j
f = f /r ⇒ r > 2) prevents slower combinations from reaching f but does not
k+1 k k
preclude adjacent cluster overlap.
• Empirical: Canonical bands are roughly log-spaced with r ≈ 2–3, close to but some-
times below the theoretical r > 2–3, which explains limited yet tolerable overlap in
practice.

Table A.1: Generators and mechanisms across canonical bands, with neural mass
models. Corticalcolumnscanlocallygenerate γ (PING/ING)andparts ofα; thalamo-cortical
loops contribute to α and dominate δ; septo-hippocampal loops pace θ; SOs (<1Hz) primarily
emerge from cortical E–I networks with slow processes and can be coordinated by thalamus.
