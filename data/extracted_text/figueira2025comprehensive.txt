ABSTRACT
Aims. We analyse ESPRESSO data for the stars HD 10700 (τCeti), HD 20794 (e Eridani), HD 102365, and HD 304636 acquired via its Guaranteed
Time Observations (GTO) programme. We characterise the stars’ radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10 cm/s on timescales ranging
from minutes to planetary periods falling within the host’s habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar
activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while undetectable remain
compatible with the available data.
Methods. We derived the stellar parameters through di fferent methods for a complete characterisation of the star. We used these parameters to
model the effects of stellar pulsations on intra-night RV variations and of stellar activity on nightly averaged values. The RVs were derived both
with the cross-correlation method and template matching, as well as over the blue and red ESPRESSO detectors independently to identify colour-
dependent parasitic effects of an instrumental or stellar nature. The study of RVs was complemented by an investigation of stellar activity indicators
using photospheric information and chromospheric indexes.
Results. A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night RV scatter of HD 10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD 102365
and HD 20794, an additional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary to explain the data.
A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets supported by the nightly averaged time series of each of these three stars, under the
assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP) regression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of HD 10700
RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20 d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. Moreover,
its physical origin remains uncertain due to the similarity with the first harmonic of the stellar rotation. ESPRESSO data on their own do not
provide conclusive evidence to support the existence of planets around HD 10700, HD 102365, or HD 304636. In addition, the comparison of RVs
with the contemporaneous indicators displays a strong correlation for HD 102365. The direct interpretation is that half of the RV variance on this
star is directly attributed to activity.
Conclusions. ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm /s on short timescales (<1 h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr.
A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm /s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact
of granulation mechanisms on RV . In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD 10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of
1.7 M⊕for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2-5M⊕for the star’s HZ.

1. Introduction
The search for exoplanets around nearby stars is now main-
stream science, with roughly 6000 planets known to date 1.
Within this sphere, the interest for the lowest-mass exoplanets
was recently spurred by the capabilities of the ESPRESSO spec-
trograph (Pepe et al. 2021). Designed with the objective of de-
tecting an Earth-mass planet within the habitable zone (HZ) of a
Sun-like star, the instrument was built to reach a radial velocity
(RV) precision of down to 10 cm/s over timescales of up to sev-

eral years. The first studies in the field, such as that of Faria et al.
(2020) and Lillo-Box et al. (2020), led to very detailed plan-
etary system characterisations. The data obtained in the context
of the consortium’s Guaranteed Time of Observations (GTO) en-
abled results such as those reported in Suárez Mascareño et al.
(2020) and Faria et al. (2022), whereby a system of two planets
was detected around Proxima Cen and the M star’s rotational-
modulated activity was modelled and corrected down to a level
of 30 cm/s, close to the photon noise of the measurements.
As discussed in Pepe et al. (2021), the GTO team, the associ-
ated observations, and their analysis are organised into working
groups (WG). WG1 is dedicated to the detection and characteri-
sation of Earth-like planets via blind RV searches. Proxima was
one of ∼25 stars observed intensively within ESPRESSO GTO
WG1 to cover periodicities up to the stars’ HZs. For the prepara-
tory work and original list of stars, we refer to Hojjatpanah et al.
(2019).

In this work, we selected four ESPRESSO GTO WG1 stars
for a detailed analysis: HD 10700 ( τ Ceti), HD 20794 ( e Eri-
dani), HD 102365, and HD 304636. These specific stars were se-
lected for having enough data points for an RV characterisation,
while also being representative of our blind RV campaign. We
first used ESPRESSO and ancillary data to characterise each star
and then followed up with RV time series calculations and their
analysis. We study the presence and characteristics of signals
from the shortest to the longest timescales: pulsations, granula-
tion, stellar activity, and, finally, the planetary signals up to the
HZ of the host stars. We discuss the currently achievable level
of radial velocity precision, our analysis choices, and the current
limitations, along with potential avenues to explore.
In Section 2, we present a summary of the literature on the
targets. In Section 3, we perform our own stellar characterisa-
tion using a range of methods. In Section 4, we describe the
ESPRESSO data acquisition and RV derivation. We discuss the
intra-night RV variations in Section 5, along with the night-to-
night and longer-term RVs and their associated quantities vari-
ations in Section 6. In Section 7, we characterise the long-term
variations with a planetary and stellar activity model. We discuss
our results in Section 8 and wrap up our conclusions in Section 9.
2. Targets and previous works
2.1. HD 10700 (τCeti)
The star HD 10700, commonly know as τCeti, is a very bright
(V = 3.50) star located only at 3.65 pc from the Sun. It is stable
photometrically and has been considered to be representative of
chromosphericaly inactive stars, as underlined by Gray & Bali-
unas (1994). The same work reports no evidence for a rotational
modulation on temperature, granulation or chromospheric activ-
ity, along with only a weak magnetic cycle at a period of roughly
11 yr.
The star was target of an RV asteroseismology campaign
with HARPS, providing accurate values for stellar mass, radius,
and luminosity (Teixeira et al. 2009). Recently, Korolik et al.
(2023) used long-baseline optical interferometric to provide ad-
ditional constraints on stellar parameters, deriving a rotation pe-
riod, Prot, of 46 ±4 d and a stellar axis inclination i of 7±7◦. A
brief summary of the parameters available in the literature is
given in Table 1.
The star’s brightness and perceived stability made it a prime
target for RV studies. The work of Pepe et al. (2011), using
HARPS (Mayor et al. 2003) data accumulated over more than 7
years, reported an RV dispersion of only 1.5 m /s for intra-night
measurements and a long-term scatter of 92 cm /s when nightly
averaged RVs are considered. This study reported that several
signals seemed to be present in the data but none was confidently
detected.
The work of Tuomi et al. (2013) put together HARPS to-
gether with AAPS and HIRES data to find evidence for five plan-
ets at periods of 13.9, 35.4, 94, 168, and 640 d with a minimum
mass of 2.0, 3.1, 3.6, 4.3, and 6.6 M ⊕, respectively, and ampli-
tudes between 58 and 75 cm/s. The same team published an up-
dated analysis in Feng et al. (2017b) reporting the detection of
only four planets, with periods of 20.0, 49.4, 162, and 636 d and
a minimum mass of 1.75, 1.83, 3.93, and 3.93 M ⊕, having am-
plitudes between 35 and 55 cm/s.2
2 In Ursula K. Le Guin’s book The Dispossessed, the star is reported
to be orbited by the twin planets Urras and Anarres. It is one of the few
works of fiction to win all three Hugo, Locus, and Nebula awards for
best novel, and if you haven’t read it you must absolutely do so.
2.2. HD 20794 (e Eridani)
The bright (V = 4.26) star HD 20794, also known as e Eridani,
has been intensively studied in exoplanet searches. It was subject
to an intense RV monitoring with HARPS and had three super-
Earths announced in Pepe et al. (2011). The data were later revis-
ited by Feng et al. (2017a), who confirmed two of the previously
presented planets and reported a different characterisation of the
third one. The stellar characterisation available is summarised
in Table 1. A recent analysis of ESPRESSO data on HD 20794
is presented in Nari et al. (2025). One particular study that is
especially pertinent to our analysis is the commissioning work
on HARPS, presented in Mayor et al. (2003), which reported a
root-mean-square (rms) RV dispersion of HD 20794 of 80 cm/s,
ascribed to p-modes.
2.3. HD 102365
HD 102365 is a bright (V = 4.89) star that stood out among
ESPRESSO GTO WG1 targets for its brightness, low rotational
velocity, and low activity level (as measured by its log(R′
HK ) in-
dex). The main stellar properties are compiled in Table 1.
Tinney et al. (2011) detected a planet around the star us-
ing 149 UCLES (Diego et al. 1990) RVs. A period inspec-
tion was done with Lomb-Scargle (LS) tools and a significant
peak with a false alarm probability (FAP) of 0.1% was found at
122 d. The best-fit parameters led to a planetary orbital period of
122.1±0.3 d, an amplitude of 2.40±0.35 m/s, and an eccentricity
of 0.34±0.14; these values corresponded to a lower mass limit
m.sin i of 16.0±2.6 M⊕.
Laliotis et al. (2023) performed an archival RV analysis on
several stars, covering HD 102365. The authors updated the or-
bital parameters using additional observations; the previously
published planetary period and eccentricity are recovered, but
the semi-amplitude is revised down to 1.38 ±0.23 m/s, a value
58% lower than announced by Tinney et al. (2011). Finally, Hill
et al. (2023) consider HD 102365 b as the most favourable HZ
non-transiting exoplanets for a spectroscopic characterisation,
underlining the proposed planet’s importance.
2.4. HD 304636
HD 304636 is listed as an M0 from Hipparcos colours (Koen
et al. 2010) that is comparatively bright for its assigned spec-
tral type (V = 9.465). Its parameters were derived in Maldonado
et al. (2019b) using ratios of pseudo-equivalent widths of spec-
tral features sensitive to the effective temperature and the stellar
metallicity. The literature values on stellar characterisation are
presented in Table 1.
The TESS transit survey (Ricker et al. 2014) identified a
planet candidate around HD 304636 with a periodicity of 7.57 d
and a transit depth of 0.29 parts per thousand (ppt), correspond-
ing to a radius of ∼0.87 R⊕. The star was then listed as a TESS
Object of Interest, TOI-741. In a recent work DiTomasso et al.
(2025) used HARPS RV observations to attempt a detection of
the candidate. While a detection was not possible, the authors
put an upper limits of 4.0 M ⊕ (at 3σ) on the mass of the planet
(if indeed present).
3. Stellar host characterisation
The modelling of stellar phenomena capable of creating RV sig-
nals requires an accurate determination of the stellar parame-
ters. We use different methodologies and ancillary data to do so.

After critically assessing and comparing the derived values, we
conclude by summarising the best estimation for each star’s pa-
rameters.
3.1. Spectroscopic analysis
We used ESPRESSO spectra to derive the stellar atmospheric
parameters Teff, log g, microturbulence ξt, and [Fe/H]. The indi-
vidual spectra were co-added to create a master spectrum with
S/N up to 2500 for each star. In this regime, the uncertainty on
the derived parameters is not limited by the spectra S /N, but by
the intrinsic precision and accuracy of the method instead.
For the first three stars, we used the methodology described
in Sousa et al. (2021) and references therein. In brief, we used
ARES3 (Sousa et al. 2007, 2015) to measure the equivalent widths
(EW) of iron lines on the combined spectra followed by a min-
imisation process to find ionisation and excitation equilibrium
and converge to the best set of spectroscopic parameters. This
process makes use of a grid of Kurucz model atmospheres (Ku-
rucz 1993) and the radiative transfer code MOOG (Sneden 1973).
For M-stars like HD 304636 the stellar parameters cannot
be derived with the same technique. We used the ODUSSEAS
code (Antoniadis-Karnavas et al. 2020)4 that employs a machine
learning approach on pseudo-EW of more than 4000 stellar ab-
sorption lines to predict the stellar e ffective temperature and

metallicity. We applied the calibration presented in Antoniadis-
Karnavas et al. (2024), which was demonstrated to provide more
accurate and consistent results than its previous iteration. In
parallel, we used the Bayesian tool SteParSyn described in
Tabernero et al. (2022).
We used the derived Teff and GAIA DR3 (Gaia Collabora-
tion et al. 2023) data and followed the procedure described in
Sousa et al. (2021) to calculate the trigonometric surface grav-
ity log gtrig. The work of Pecaut & Mamajek (2013) was used to
assign a spectral type to the Teff of each star. The spectroscopic
parameters Teff, log g, microturbulence ξt, and [Fe /H], plus the
associated log gtrig and spectral type are presented in Table 2.
3.2. Spectral energy distribution analysis
We used the ARIADNE5 package described in Vines & Jenkins
(2022) to perform a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of
stellar models and with it determine stellar parameters from pho-
tometric data. The program cross-matches source coordinates
over a wide range of catalogues to retrieve photometry and asso-
ciated uncertainties; it then fits the SED across the available pho-
tometric bands using several stellar atmosphere models and em-
ploying Bayesian model averaging (BMA). With this approach,
the final posterior is created by drawing from the posterior of
the different models, weighted by their evidence. The parame-
ters posteriors are then wider due to the systematic di fferences

averaging is done over PHOENIX (Husser et al. 2013), BT-Settl
(Allard et al. 2012), ATLAS9 (Castelli & Kurucz 2003), and
SYNTHE Kurucz (Kurucz 1993) models. ARIADNE then queries
Gaia DR3 for parameters, and provides the best estimate for sev-
eral other stellar parameters. Since our aim is to obtain an in-
dependent stellar characterisation, we used the default (weakly
informative) priors on the parameters to fit.
The input photometry and model priors are detailed in Ap-
pendix A; the best-fit stellar parameters Teff; logg [Fe /H]; dis-

3.3. Mass and radius computations from evolutionary models
We derived the stellar mass and radius using the Bayesian code
PARAM6 (da Silva et al. 2006; Rodrigues et al. 2014, 2017). A grid
of stellar evolutionary tracks was matched to the derived quan-
tities of Teff, [Fe/H] from spectroscopic analysis and luminosity
from ARIADNE as presented in the previous subsection. The grid
of stellar evolutionary isochrones was taken from PARSEC7 v2.1
(the PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code; Bressan et al.
(2012). The median and the 68% confidence intervals (C.I. 68%)
of the posterior distribution are used to derive the most probable
values for mass and radius, presented in Table 4.

3.4. Rotational periods from photometry and chromospheric
activity indexes
On top of the fundamental stellar parameters listed, an estima-
tion of the rotational period is key for the characterisation of
RV activity signals. We analysed the public ASAS-SN (Shappee
et al. 2014) and TESS photometry (Ricker et al. 2014) to search
for periodic signals that could represent the stellar rotation mod-
ulation of the four targets. We used thetpfplotter8 (Aller et al.
2020) and TESS-cont9 (Castro-González et al. 2024) to ensure
that most of the photometric flux comes from the target stars. The
TESS Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) and the systematics-
corrected Presearch Data Conditioned Simple Aperture Photom-
etry (PDCSAP) were downloaded from the Mikulski Archive for
Space Telescopes (MAST)10.
The ASAS-SN data were downloaded through the Sky Patrol
web interface 11. The stars in our sample have relatively large
proper motions (pm) of 1-3" /yr, and the instrumental FWHMs
are comparable to the ASAS-SN photometric apertures (i.e. ∼2
pixels, with a pixel scale or 8"). To avoid flux losses, we down-
loaded the image subtraction (IS) photometry in short chunks
based on the pm-corrected coordinates, similarly to Castro-
González et al. (2023). Given the brightness of the stars, we
also downloaded the ASAS-SN photometry extracted through
the novel Machine Learning (ML) approach, which is aimed at
improving the photometric quality of saturated sources (Winecki
& Kochanek 2024). We ran theGLS periodogram on the four data
sets (TESS/SAP, TESS/PDCSAP, ASAS-SN/IS, ASAS-SN/ML)
for the four stars, and found no significant activity signals in any
of them. This result is consistent with the low chromospheric
activity previously reported in the literature (Sect. 2). The null
results on HD 304636 are in line with the recent work of DiTo-
masso et al. (2025).

Figueira et al. (2025): ESPRESSO’s RVs down to the 10 cm/s level
index. This relation was explored in the original study of Noyes
et al. (1984b) and an updated version was presented in Mamajek
& Hillenbrand (2008) that gained significant traction in the com-
munity. This study calibrates the Rossby number,R0, as function
of the activity index, and associates it to the rotational period,
Prot, via the relation R0 = Prot/τc, where τc is the convective
turnover of the star. Since τc is a function of e ffective tempera-
ture, we then have Prot( log(R′
HK ) , Teff ).
Suárez Mascareño et al. (2016) calibrated photometrically
determined rotational periods against log(R′
HK ), considering 125
stars either as a monolithic set or as subsets of G, K, and M
dwarfs. The authors estimated the accuracy of their calibration
from the achieved dispersion, reaching values of the order of
20% for low-activity stars ( log( R′
HK ) <4.5 ). The spectral type
of our stars are well defined from the study in Section 3.1 and
Section 3.2. For HD 10700 and HD 102365, we used the calibra-
tion for K dwarfs, for HD 20794 the calibration for G dwarfs,
and for HD 304636 the calibration for M dwarfs. HD 102365
was paired with the K dwarfs due to its late spectral type within
the G and due to the low-number statistics of the Suárez Mas-
careño et al. (2016) G dataset. For log( R′
HK ) we use the value
derived by Hojjatpanah et al. (2019) and available for the four
stars. We considered an uncertainty 20% for the calculated ro-
tational period, as used by these authors. Thus, we achieved a
value of 37.7 ±7.5 d for HD 10700, 27.7 ±5.5 d for HD 20794,
36.4±7.3 d for HD 102365, and 30.3±6.1 d for HD 304636. We
caution, however, that this determination depends strongly on the
assumed spectral type, as explained in Appendix B.
3.5. Final stellar parameters and their accuracy
The stellar parameters derived from ESPRESSO spectra are
compatible with those available in the literature (Table 1) and in
particular with the ESPRESSO GTO preparatory work done in
Hojjatpanah et al. (2019). The higher resolution of ESPRESSO
and higher S /N of the spectra of this work allowed for slightly
more accurate determinations. We note the match between
ODUSSEAS and SteParSyn results for HD 304636; the di ffer-
ence in formal uncertainty between the two methods is due
to ODUSSEAS representing accuracy variance while SteparSyn
representing only the formal error. Since we are interested
in accuracy we use the values and uncertainties delivered by
ODUSSEAS.
A comparison between the spectral parameters derivation
and the SED fitting results shows agreement (within formal un-
certainties) for the effective temperature and metallicity. A com-
parison between SED fitting and isochrones show agreement in
radii but not in mass. The luminosity values derived in our work
for HD 10700 and HD 102365 also match the values derived by
Teixeira et al. (2009) and Pepe et al. (2011) very well, and are
well within the formal error bars.
For the analysis in the remainder of the paper, if a parameter
can be determined via multiple methods, we selected the one that
provides the highest accuracy. For the effective temperature, we
chose values derived by spectroscopic analysis, for the luminos-
ity the values from ARIADNE SED, and for the mass and radius
the values derived using PARAM and PARSEC. We note, however,
that the di fferent quantities are determined at a di fferent accu-
racy level, which, in turn, depends on the method chosen. In
Tayar et al. (2022) the authors compared fundamental param-
eters obtained through di fferent methods and concluded on the
existence of a systematic uncertainty floor of approximately 2%
in effective temperature, 2% in luminosity, 4% in radius, and 5%
in mass. The systematic floor level on luminosity is smaller than
the ones derived in our work and, thus, it is not expected to be
a limitation. However, for effective temperature it is comparable
or larger than the ones we derived; for mass and radii they are
appreciably larger than derived by several of our methods and,
thus, we might be limited by systematic errors. We only find ev-
idence of such an issue with respect to mass.
For the stellar rotation period we consider the values calcu-
lated in Sect. 3.4. To our knowledge, there is no prior study on
the accuracy of activity-indexes calibration in delivering rota-
tional periods. The relative uncertainty of 20% on the rotational
period used by Suárez Mascareño et al. (2016) is conservative
when compared with other derivations and is obtained directly
from the scatter of the calibration. It should, nonetheless, be used
with care as a wrong spectral type or variable activity index can
lead to di fferent rotational periods in a way that cannot be in-
cluded in the uncertainty value.
Using the stellar effective temperature, luminosity and stellar
mass above, we followed Kopparapu et al. (2013) and Koppa-
rapu et al. (2014)12, to compute the conservative HZ limits for a
planet with 1 M⊕. The values calculated using these methods are
summarised in Table 5 and used in the remainder of the paper.
4. ESPRESSO data, radial velocities and indicators
ESPRESSO is a high-resolution echelle spectrograph stabilised
in temperature and pressure, and with mechanically fixed optics.
The instrument operates on the ESO VLT and is physically lo-
cated in the Combined Coudé lab. Light feeding is done from
any of the four UT telescopes (or any combination of these) with
a Coudé train and enters the spectrograph via two parallel fibres;
the first points to the centre of the telescope field-of-view and
the second points either to the neighbouring sky or to a simul-
taneous calibration source. The spectra from the two fibres are
recorded simultaneously in interweaving orders. A pupil slicer
splits the interference orders into two parallel slices; the spectra
are imaged onto and collected by two detectors, located inside
two independent cryostats. The complete wavelength coverage
goes from 370 to 788 nm. This design allows for an extreme RV
stability down to a target precision of 10 cm/s. We refer to Pepe
et al. (2021) for further details.
4.1. Data acquisition, calibration, and pipeline reduction
Observations were acquired in high-resolution (HR) mode, with
light fed by the 1′′-diameter fibre, and delivering a resolution of
∼140 000; the detectors were read without applying spatial or
spectral direction binning (sampling 1x1). Given the brightness
of the stars and thus a comparatively low contribution of readout
noise to the error budget, we selected a FAST readout speed.
ESPRESSO’s wavelength calibration uses a Thorium-Argon
lamp and a Fabry-Perot (FP) illuminated by a flat spectral source
(Wildi et al. 2010). Combining the absolute reference from the
atomic lines with the regular grid of FP lines enables the deriva-
tion of an homogeneous and precise wavelength solution across
ESPRESSO’s wavelength range.
On top of precise wavelength solution methodology,
ESPRESSO uses a simultaneous reference technique, described
in detail for its precursor ELODIE in Baranne et al. (1996). For
precise RVs the second fibre is illuminated by the FP to measure
the instrument’s drift relative to the last wavelength solution; this
provides for a way to quantify and correct for any instrument’s

internal stability variation. This drift value is calculated indepen-
dently for the two detectors.
The observations were acquired with a cadence of up to 10%
of the star’s HZ inner edge period, as a trade-o ff between time
investment and ability to detect planets up to the HZ. All ob-
servations were reduced with the ESPRESSO pipeline version
3.3.113. The pipeline provides a complete and automatic re-
duction chain, from the raw files to the post-processing analy-
sis such as the radial velocities and associated quantities. The
main improvements of the major version 3 are: the calculation
of time-dependent chromatic variation of the etalon spacing and
potential lamp flux variations (Schmidt et al. 2022), along with
improved masks weights that take into account the line’s full-
width at half maximum (FWHM) to calculate the Doppler infor-
mation content (instead of the contrast only). In version 3.3.1,
the pipeline also accounts for the influence of the variable Sun-
Earth distance and observer’s velocity in the barycentric cor-
rection computation (an e ffect with an amplitude smaller than
20 cm/s).
As an additional step, we calculated the parallax-dependent
term of the barycentric correction to apply to RVs(see. e.g.
Eastman et al. 2010). We did so by subtracting from the
barycorrpy14 (Kanodia & Wright 2018) computation (using
the Gaia DR3 parallax) the correction value calculated by the
ESPRESSO pipeline. For reference, the value of this term is be-
low 1 cm/s for HD 10700, peak-to-peak. Nonetheless, we added
this differential barycentric correction term to the RVs, a poste-
riori, for the sake of completeness in correction15.
Finally, for each acquired spectra the ESPRESSO pipeline
also produces an extracted spectrum corrected for telluric H 2O
absorption, computed as described in Allart et al. (2022). This
telluric-corrected spectrum is also provided with associated RVs
and ancillary quantities.
4.2. Instrument interventions and technical issues
In June 2019 a new fibre feed was installed in ESPRESSO.
While the instrument focus did not need an adjustment, we can-
not exclude the possibility that the intervention introduced an
offset in the RVs calculation. As such, we consider throughout
the paper two data sets ESPR18 and ESPR19 corresponding to
before and after the intervention, respectively The two optome-

15 We are fully aware that adding the RV is formally incorrect, but the
error incurred in this approximation will be below the cm /s and and as
such negligible for our target precision.
chanical configurations are treated then as two di fferent instru-
ments, which introduces an offset parameter on our RV analysis.
For more on the topic we refer to the equivalent situation on
HARPS, described in Lo Curto et al. (2015).
Previous works, such as that of Faria et al. (2022), considered
the ESPR21 dataset, corresponding to the data acquired after the
COVID 19 observations interruption. This dataset was differen-
tiated by the use of a di fferent FP light source with a markedly
different flux distribution than its predecessor. However, since
pipeline version 3, calibration lamp flux di fferences are taken
into account and absorbed by the improved wavelength calibra-
tion; a dataset separation is thus no longer necessary.
From January to April 2021, ESPRESSO atmospheric dis-
persion corrector (ADCs) were a ffected by a critical communi-
cation issue. The ADC prisms were not positioned at the correct
configuration, which led to the atmospheric dispersion not being
corrected. A comparison of RVs taken with the ADC operating
correctly showed that the compromised dataset was a ffected by
an additional scatter ≳1 m/s. Programs aiming at high spectral fi-
delity are also compromised by systematic errors on the flux and
line-spread function determinations. The severity of these effects
will vary from spectrum to spectrum, and without having access
to the ADC’s true position a correction is not possible. We used
a zero value of the header ADC2 keywords on right ascension,
pressure and temperature to identify the observations a ffected,
that were then discarded16.
Since we are aiming at the highest precision in RV , we re-
strict our analysis to spectra in which the pipeline general qual-
ity control, flux correction of atmospheric absorption, and drift
correction were all correctly executed17.
We identified three nights corrupted by localised issues or
events. On the 30 th October 2018 at 2UT a pressure gauge
stopped working and there was a sudden increase of pressure
within ESPRESSO vacuum vessel. This a ffected a series of
HD 10700 observations taken around 3UT (MJD = 58421.65 d),
that was discarded from our analysis. The pressure gauge was
replaced on the following day and did not a ffect any other mea-
sures. On the 28th July 2022, around 06 UT a block of HD 10700
observations was interrupted halfway, with the astronomer on
duty signalling an interruption due to weather. A check on seis-
mic activity logs of that day showed an earthquake with magni-
tude 6.2 and epicentre on Calama, only ∼280 km from the ob-
servatory, triggering multiple aftershocks. We discard also this
incomplete series of observations (MJD = 59788.7 d).

Figueira et al. (2025): ESPRESSO’s RVs down to the 10 cm/s level
ESPRESSO was designed to centre the image of the star on
the entrance of the fibre after the spectrally dispersed image is
spatially corrected by the ADC. The operational limit of this de-
vice is at a maximum airmass of 2.2; observations at higher air-
mass will contain an uncorrected component, with the extreme
blue and red wavelengths being slightly o ff-centred. Up to an
airmass value of 2.3, this uncorrected term remains very small,
with the maximum difference between the bluest and reddest star
image centre of 0.15 ′′. In this case, and for the specific case
of ESPRESSO design, the loss in flux is of 1.5% in the blue
and 0.5% in the red, and the RV e ffect is expected to be much
smaller than 1 cm/s (Wehbe et al. 2020). As such, we choose to
keep the spectra taken up to an airmass of 2.3 in the analysis,
affecting only 12 individual integrations spread over 3 nights.
However, we choose to discard a series of observation taken
in the airmass range of 2.5-2.9, on the 7 th December 2020 at
6UT (MJD = 59190.25 d, fully outside the operation range of the
ADC and for which the effect in RV can be larger than 10 cm/s,
due to a considerable reduction in the flux of the bluest orders.
4.3. RV calculation
The RV used in this paper were calculated from the ESPRESSO
pipeline extracted spectra, and followed two parallel methodolo-
gies:
– Cross-correlation function method(CCF), in which a mask
representative of the spectral lines for a spectral type is cross-
correlated with the measured spectra. For the original ref-
erence on the method and upgrade to weighted masks as a
function of the spectral type, we refer to Baranne et al. (1996)
and Pepe et al. (2002), respectively.
– Correlation with a template mask, where a template is first
constructed by stacking a large number of spectra form the
star, and the correlation is calculated between the individual
spectra and this empirical template. We use the methodology
described and demonstrated for ESPRESSO in Silva et al.
(2022), named S-BART.
The specificities of the application ofS-BART to ESPRESSO
high-precision RV are given in Appendix C. For the following
analysis, it is important to retain that by defaultS-BART discards
wavelength regions contaminated by telluric features deeper than
1%.
On top of the standard S-BART run, we calculate the RVs
using the spectra taken from either the blue or the red detector
only. These chromatic RVs enable additional diagnosis for ac-
tivity and the study of detector-based systematic e ffects. In the
remainder of the paper the RV time series corresponding to the
cross-correlation, S-BART with two detectors, S-BART blue de-
tector, and S-BART red are labelled CCF, TM, TMb, and TMr, re-
spectively.
The ESPRESSO spectra, CCF RVs and associated quantities
were retrieved via the DACE interface18. To execute the DACE
queries we used the arvi19 package, which allows for command
line manipulation and data download, and performs convenient
tasks such as secular acceleration correction using Simbad stel-
lar parameters and to calculate the photon-noise weighed aver-
age RV . The complete time series for the four stars, including
reduced and ancillary data is made publicly available to all via
the DACE interface.

19 https://github.com/j-faria/arvi
4.4. Photospheric line profile and chromospheric activity
indicators
On the CCF one can measure directly the contrast, FWHM, and
bisector inverse slope (BIS). The BIS was early on identified as
a useful line profile indicator for tracking photospheric stellar
activity (Queloz et al. 2001), and has seen extensive use. For sta-
bilised spectrographs in which the instrumental profile can be
assumed as fixed, the FWHM can be used as an indicator of stel-
lar photospheric activity as well. This has been demonstrated for
ESPRESSO on the works of Suárez Mascareño et al. (2020) and
Faria et al. (2022) for the M dwarf Proxima.
The most extensively used chromospheric indicator is the
log(R′
HK ) calculated from the Mount Wilson S index data and
originally developed with the objective of studying long-term
stellar activity (Noyes et al. 1984a). We used theACTIN package
(Gomes da Silva et al. 2018) to implement both log( R′
HK ) and
Hα. For a detailed discussion of log(R′
HK ) as used in ACTIN, we
refer to Gomes da Silva et al. (2021); for the Hα implementation
and in particular the choice of wavelength bandwidth around the
line, we refer to Gomes da Silva et al. (2022).
For the stars that have more than one spectrum per night,
the activity indexes value is calculated independently for each
spectra and the uncertainty-weighted average value taken as rep-
resentative for the night, in parallel with what is done on RV .
5. Intra-night radial velocity variations
When observing very bright stars at a sub-m /s RV precision, it
is common to acquire multiple consecutive short integrations.
This allows us to cover the typical timescales of stellar pulsa-
tions and average out their RV signal, while keeping the photo-
electrons on individual exposures below CCD saturation level.
We employed this observational strategy for the G - K stars
HD 10700, HD 20794, and HD 102365 studied in this work. We
obtained between 7 and 15 spectra at very high S/N (ranging be-
tween 200 and 660), leading to photon noise RV uncertainties
below 30 cm/s and well adapted to the search for low-mass plan-
ets at high RV precision. Observations of the fainter M dwarf
HD 304636 employ a single integration per night, and the star is
not discussed in this section.
The acquisition of several consecutive RV points each night
allows for an evaluation of the RV precision on the short
timescales they cover, ranging from minutes to around half an
hour. In Fig 1 we plot the distribution of photon-noise uncertain-
ties and the observed intra-night scatter (as root-mean-square or
rms) for the four different RV time series CCF, TM, TMb, and TMr
for the three stars. We considered only nights when the complete
number of exposures was acquired, when the sequence was not
interrupted by weather or operational issues. The cumulative dis-
tribution functions are fitted by a cumulative log-normal distri-
bution.
The time series CCF, TM, TMb, and TMr RVs display a very
low photon noise, between 10 and 20 cm/s. The intra-night scat-
ter is significantly larger and dependent on the star, being of
∼40 cm/s for HD 10700, ∼50 cm/s for HD 20794, and ∼60 cm/s
for HD 102365.
5.1. P-mode pulsations modelling
The main source of RV scatter for main sequence G-K stars
on timescales of minutes is arguably the p-mode waves. These
stellar pulsations are characterised by the quantities maximum
pulsation frequency, νmax, and large frequency separation, ∆ν,

quency of the strongest pulsation mode and the large frequency
separation is, to a first approximation, twice the frequency sepa-
ration between consecutive modes.
For RV pulsation signals, the mode amplitude envelope is
well approximated by a Gaussian function and its FWHM scales
linearly with large frequency separation (Lund et al. 2017). For
our cases we consider FWHMenv = 10 ∆ν, in line with theoretical
works such as Chaplin et al. (2019) (see their Fig. 2). Pulsation
studies using photometry showed independently that FWHM env
= νmax/2 (Campante et al. 2016), again in line with our assump-
tions.

Dedicated asteroseismology campaigns have allowed for the
accurate measurement of these asteroseismic quantities for main
sequence stars, which we have used as our benchmark; we chose
αCen A and µAra, studied in detail in Bouchy & Carrier (2002)
and Bouchy et al. (2005), respectively. The stellar parameters
and average reference values are presented in Table D.1.
We simulated the p-mode signals contribution to the RV
measured on each star; we use the simulation to calculate both
the intra-night scatter generated and represented in Fig. 1 and the
additional variance introduced on the nightly averaged RVs as it
will be of interest to long-term RV analysis. We proceeded as
follows.
For the star’s maximum pulsation frequency, νmax – the
strongest p-mode – we created a sinusoidal RV signal of am-
plitude Aenv with a random phase. Then, for the neighbouring
modes of frequencies ±∆ν/2, we calculated the mode amplitude
from the envelope value at the corresponding frequency and sim-
ulate two sinusoidal signals, each with a random phase. We re-
peated this procedure for increasingly higher-order modes m of
frequency ±m ∆ν/2 stopping when the mode amplitude as drawn
from the envelope is smaller than 1 cm/s.
The RV signal of the calculated modes was co-added and its
value projected on a temporal grid representing the detector inte-
gration sequence for each star in one night, with the integrations

simulations were then repeated 50 000 times to obtain the same
number of individual sequences, or nights. For each sequence,
we calculated the RV o ffset introduced by the pulsation signal
on this particular observation as the RV weighted mean and the
intra-night dispersion from the intra-night rms. The dispersion
of the RV offset, epuls, is representative of the uncertainty intro-
duced by the pulsation on the average value, while the median
of the intra-night dispersion distribution, σpuls, can be directly
compared to the observed one. For visual representations of key
steps of the simulation, we refer to Appendix D.2; namely, we
depict how the frequencies are drawn, an example of pulsations
during one night and a distribution of scatter and distance to the
mean when repeating the process a large number of times.
For the stellar parameters we use the values presented in Ta-
ble 5; the measured and simulated quantities are presented in Ta-
ble 6, namely the distribution median photon noise, eph.noise, the
measured scatter, σmeas, the final uncertainty introduced by pul-
sations on the nightly average, epuls, and the dispersion created
by pulsation on the intra-night set σpuls. The results are found to
be repeatable and thus consistent down to 1-2 cm/s.

The first takeaway is that epuls is of 5-10 cm /s. This is ex-
pected, in line with the common assumption that averaging the
p-modes over a timescale of a few pulsation periods is enough
to correct for their contribution to the nightly averaged RV . We
show here it is also achieved at a precision of better than 10 cm/s.
The simulations predict a scatter σpuls that follows the
observed σmeas. The pulsation-induced scatter for HD 10700
matches the observations to 1-2 cm /s, and for HD 20794 to 4-
5 cm/s. For the earlier spectral type (G5) HD 102365 there is a
larger and clearly non-negligible di fference of 10 cm/s between
predicted and observed values. ESPRESSO is expected to have
a RV precision of better than 10 cm /s over one hour, and if in-
strument stability was the source of scatter it would be present
in all stars, having been easily detected for at least HD 10700.
The discrepancy can be attributed to poor stellar parameter de-
termination or an additional source of scatter.
5.2. Granulation signal modelling
The convective phenomena on stellar photospheres are com-
monly referred to as granulation. Contrary to pulsations, the
physical mechanisms governing their RV signals remains poorly
understood. Solar observations enabled the measurement of the
RV signal of convection cells, or granules, and of the coordinated
motion of groups of granules, often know as super-granules (Si-
mon & Leighton 1964), which create an additional RV com-
ponent know as super-granulation. While the granules lifetime
and renovation time has long been estimated at ∼10 min (e.g.
Bahng & Schwarzschild 1961; Giannattasio et al. 2013), super-
granulation timescales are still the object of active research, with
Sowmya et al. (2023) showing the values range from ∼24 h for
the quiet to ∼54 h for the active regions. For a review on super-
granulation, including studies on timescales, we refer to Rincon
& Rieutord (2018).
There has been significant focus on the photometric obser-
vation of granulation on giant stars, as their extended convec-
tive region and higher brightness allow for a more accurate sig-
nal characterisation than on main sequence stars. A star’s power
spectrum density (PSD) is fitted with Harvey-type functions
PSD(ν) = A/(1 + (τν)α)), in which A is the amplitude, τ is the
characteristic timescale, and αis the power-law slope.
In the literature one can find di fferent implementations. The
photometric granulation signal is represented as a sum of up to
three Harvey functions, and di fferent functional forms are used
to represent the pulsation signal (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian), with
some authors choosing not to fit the pulsation-dominated fre-
quencies. The work of Mathur et al. (2011) reviewed the dif-
ferent operational choices applied to Kepler data and concluded
that the results are qualitatively similar, but the quantitative dif-
ferences still leave room for di fferent interpretations on the un-
derlying physics. The authors showed then that from basic prin-
ciples one has τ ∝1 /νmax, and found evidence for the relation-
ship between the power of granulation andνmax, Pgran ∝1 /ν2
max,
as proposed by Kjeldsen & Bedding (2011). The Kepler mission
data is used to fit the slopes of these dependencies as τ ∝ν−0.89
max
and Pgran ∝ ν−1.90
max , but the residuals around the fitted models
exhibit non-negligible scatter.
Comparatively, there have been much fewer works attempt-
ing to characterise granulation on RV; we summarise these in
Appendix E. For our simulations we follow the PSD character-
isation of Al Moulla et al. (2023) on Sun RV data. The authors
used two components and fix the slope α at 2. Since the im-
portance of scaling the parameters is still a matter of debate,
we performed a first set of simulations with the quantities mea-
sured for the Sun and for a second we applied the scaling re-
lationships on Eq. 5.1 to derive the amplitude and granulation
timescales. For the sake of simplicity and in accordance with
the literature, we refer to the two components as granulation and
super-granulation.
The RVs were calculated as in Al Moulla et al. (2023), de-
composing the power spectra into frequencies, ν, with width,
∆ν,that generate signals with amplitude √PS D(ν) ∆ν,and ran-
domised phase. The integration limits are set by the limits of
our knowledge: since we cannot characterise granulation on
timescales longer than 100 d, our lowest frequency was set at
0.1 µHz; given we cannot sample signals with higher cadence
than 1 minute (our Nyquist frequency), we set the upper limit at
6 mHz. The integration is done in steps of 1 µHz. For the sake
of simplicity, we perform the simulations for CCF and TM only.

The results with the solar and scaled values are similar, with
the scaled values showing a larger variation across stars, up to
5 cm/s. The granulation component introduces an uncertainty of
19-28 cm/s on the nightly averaged RVs; on the other hand, the
super-granulation component introduces an uncertainty of 58-
71 cm/s. Either component introduces an intra-night scatter of
15-20 cm/s.
With this model, the granulation or super-granulation com-
ponents impact on the intra-night scatter remains of around
25 cm/s across stars, and scaled / unscaled modelling choices.
When one discounts the e ffects of pulsations, this estimation
is in excess of the values measured for HD 10700 but remains
compatible with the scatter measurements on the other two stars.
However, the effect of super-granulation, of 65-70 cm /s, is not
averaged out by our observation strategy and should be easily
detectable as a parasitic e ffect on the night-to-night RV varia-
tion.
6. Nightly averaged time series
We perform an analysis of the nightly averaged RV time se-
ries of the targets HD 10700 and HD 102365, and on those of
HD 304646, for which a single observation per night was taken.
The analysis of nightly averaged time series of HD 20794 was
presented in Nari et al. (2025).
6.1. Dataset properties and simple statistics
The RV time series are shown in Fig. 2 and simple statistics
listed in Table 8. For each star, dataset, and RV timeseries we
list the number of nights and observing time span, plus the aver-
age RV uncertainty (calculated only from the photon noise) and
weighted rms of the nightly averaged RVs.
On HD 10700, CCF TMand TMb show an average uncertainty
of 3 cm/s, with TMr being larger at 5 cm /s. The weighted rms
is of 67-70 cm/s for the different RV calculations; the similarity
between TM, TMb and TMr suggests that the dominant source of
scatter is achromatic.
For HD 102365 there is a clear di fference between the
ESPR18 and ESPR19 datasets. While the average photon noise
is similar, the rms of the nightly averaged RVs increases sig-
nificantly from ESPR18 to ESPR19. In contrast, HD 304636
ESPR18 shows a significantly higher rms than ESPR19. For both
stars TMr shows a significantly lower scatter than TMb. This
colour-dependent rms points towards an activity-induced flux-
dominated RV variation, that is known to be mitigated at redder
wavelengths, where the photometric contrast (or flux) e ffect be-
tween active regions is smaller. A variation of the instrument
stability is excluded by the contemporaneous RVs of HD 10700,
that show a scatter of only 60-70 cm /s over approximately the
same period.
It is worth noting that for the two G-K stars HD 10700 and
HD 102365 the effect of pulsations on the nightly average was
estimated to be slightly larger than when considering photon
noise alone: for HD 10700 we estimate the uncertainties to in-
crease up to 5 cm/s, and for HD 102365 up to 8 cm/s.
The temporal evolution of the stars in RV does not define a
clear shape. In Fig. 2 for HD 10700 we have what seems to be
a periodic signal in the relative variation ∆(TM - CFF), which we
discuss in Sect. 7.2. The temporal evolution of the photospheric
and chromospheric indicators is presented in Fig. 3. Their scatter
is much larger than their formal uncertainties. The line asymme-
try and width variations measured by the BIS and FWHM are
not expected to vary for observations of very quiet stars with
RV-dedicated spectrograph, that were built to have stable instru-
mental profiles. As such, the variability shown could actually
represent an activity effect impacting the RV .
Lovis et al. (2011) had already noted that long-term RV
trends caused by the stellar magnetic cycles would be detected as
opposite sign trends on the FWHM and the contrast indicators;
this might be at play here. However, a very slow monotonic vari-
ation in resolution over the years20 can explain small-amplitude
indicator variations as seen on HD 10700.
The log( R′
HK ) chromospheric indicator is known to show
variability even for the lowest activity stars. The Sun shows a
variation in log(R′
HK ) of 0.05 due to rotational modulation during
its low-activity phase (e.g., Milbourne et al. 2019; Maldonado
et al. 2019a), and low-activity solar-like stars, like the ones tar-
geted commonly by RV searches, show similar amplitudes (Bal-
iunas et al. 1985). Gomes da Silva et al. (2021), showed that
even HD 10700, one of the lowest variability stars within their
HARPS sample, has a variability of 1.6%, that corresponds to
0.017. This matches well the ESPRESSO observations presented
here.
Overall, the long-term ( ≳100 d) evolution of FWHM, Con-
trast, BIS, and log( R′
HK ) on di fferent stars and with di fferent
slopes is suggestive of a long-term activity evolution of the stars
over the 4 years of our observations.
6.2. Presence of periodic signals
We computed the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LS, Lomb 1976;
Scargle 1982) in its floating-mean form (known as generalised
Lomb-Scargle, GLS) as introduced by Zechmeister & Kürster
(2009) and implemented in astropy. The false-alarm probabil-
ity (FAP) is computed as defined on Baluev (2008). We chose
three FAP threshold probabilities of 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%, and
a maximum frequency of 1 d −1 for the GLS and FAP calcula-
tions. The LS periodogram for the different RV sets is shown in
Fig 4, along with the different FAP. Given the observations time
span is ∼1500 d we consider the longest period that can be con-
fidently detected is of the order of 1000 d; variations longer than
this value are better modelled as linear or quadratic slopes and a
frequency-oriented discussion is not particularly insightful.

For HD 10700 the different RV time series exhibit di fferent
significant peaks: CCF at 1.13 d,TM at 1.05 d and 1.13 d (the three
at (1% FAP) and TMr a doublet at 20.07 and 21.23 d (reaching
0.1% FAP). TMb shows a significant peak at 1500 d (between 1%
0.01% FAP). No significant signals are detected on HD 102365
or HD 304636.
The peaks of the LS periodogram do not represent directly
the best-fit matches to a sinusoidal signal. The amplitude of the
periodogram at a given frequency depends not only on the sig-
nals present at this frequency but but also on signal spectral leak-
age, that depends directly on the temporal sampling. This e ffect
is represented by the Window function, estimated by setting the
measured RV signal at 1.0 (see VanderPlas 2018); the window
functions for the di fferent stars is shown on the bottom row of
Fig 4. The strongest individualised peak is at approximately one
year (360 d for HD 10700, 350 d for the other two stars), only
topped by the broad signals with periods longer than 2000 d.
The window functions of HD 102365 and HD 304636 also show
strong power at 1000 d. It is worth noting the doublet seen in
HD 10700 TMr are aliases if one considers a sampling frequency
of approximately year.
The FAP is known to be a reliable estimator, as long as the
uncertainties and the frequency grid are correctly defined (see
e.g. Delisle et al. 2020, for a discussion). Unfortunately, so far
we have only considered photon-noise uncertainties for the er-
ror budget. If we repeat the GLS and FAP calculations adding
quadratically 10 cm/s to the individual photon noise error bars
the signals of HD 10700 become non-significant, and the signals
at 310-330 d in CCF, TM, and TMb approach 1% FAP. This serves
as a word of caution on the interpretation of the frequency anal-
ysis.

The LS periodogram evaluates the least-square fit of a sin-
gle sinusoidal function to the data and assumes that the formal
uncertainties describe the variance of the dataset. These two as-
sumptions can be lifted by considering theℓ1 periodogram (Hara
et al. 2017), that uses sparse recovery tools to represent a RV
times series as linear combinations of a small number of si-
nusoidal functions. The tool also allows us to define the noise
model via a covariance matrix V, and we adopt the representa-
tion with element Vkl of the form

Figueira et al. (2025): ESPRESSO’s RVs down to the 10 cm/s level
where (on top of the individual nominal uncertainties, σk), we
consider a white noise, σW , common to all data and a red noise
with standard deviation, σR, and a timescale, τ.
To solve the basis pursuit model we used the default choice
of the least-angle regression (LARS) 21 algorithm. Significance
is estimated with the FAP, defined for the sequence of peaks,
namely, the first value evaluates the presence of the highest am-
plitude signal, the second value evaluates the presence of the two
highest amplitude signals, and so on, all calculated relative to the
null hypothesis of no signals present in the data. We used ℓ1 on
our RV datasets, restricting our analysis to periodicities longer
than 1 d.
In a first analysis we considered a white noise component of
10 cm/s. The resulting periodograms are shown in Fig 5, with the
ten strongest peaks represented. The calculated FAP values for
the three stars and different RV calculation methods are listed in
App. F .
The detected signals have either a FAP larger than 1% or a
period very similar to our temporal baseline. For HD 10700 CFF
show a 3% FAP signal close to one year, whileTM and TMb show
a significant signal at 1423.5 d. A signal with 20 d inTM and TMb
and a very similar signal in TMr show a FAP of a few percent.
For HD 102365 there is no formally significant signal and for
HD 304636, we would need a combination of 10 (CCF), 6 (TMb),
or the 10 peaks (TMr) to reach an FAP of 1%.
The forest of peaks on the ℓ1 periodogram is characteristic
of noisy datasets that do not have a sparse representation in fre-
quency, as discussed in Hara et al. (2020). In such a case, we
should evaluate the impact of the noise model and to test mod-
els including correlated noise. We followed the cross-validation
methodology described in Appendix B.1 of Hara et al. (2020)
and compared models with white noise σW of 10, 20, 40, and
60 cm/s combined with σR with a value of 0 (no red noise com-
ponent), 20, and 60 cm /s and timescales of 0.02 and 0.54 d.
These amplitudes and timescales correspond roughly to the two
timescales and amplitudes of granulation measured on the Sun.
An average of the 20% of the models with the highest cross-
validation ranking still led to FAP that were, at best, much larger
than 1%; the only exception were the already detected signals at
1423.5 d for HD 10700.
In summary, there is only one periodic signal detected in RV
with a period below 1000 d. It is present in the di fferent tem-
plate matching RV time series of HD 10700 and has an approx-
imate period of 20 d. The signal is statistically significant when
measured with an LS analysis but only if photon-noise error
bars are considered, and with varying significance between 1%
and 0.05%, depending on the RV reduction. On ℓ1 the signal is
present but with FAP of a few percent, and cannot be considered
significant. The other signals detected are a consequence of the
window function effect.
6.3. Activity indicators study: periodicity and correlations
We perform an LS periodogram analysis for the indicators as
previously done for RVs. The results are presented in Fig. 6. By
construction, the window function for the indicators is almost
identical to that of the RV data and was therefore omitted.
For HD 10700, the di fferent photospheric indicators show
peaks at common periods: 307 d, and 440 d, and a wide peak
from 1250 d approximately ( <0.01% FAP). The log( R′
HK ) in-
21 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-angle_
regression
dicator has a peak at 230 d (1% FAP) and a much wider and
stronger peak from 550 to 1050 d (<0.01% FAP).
HD 102365 shows highly significant power for periods
longer than 1380 d in FWHM ( <0.01% FAP) and between 570
and 690 d in Ha06 (between 0.1% and 1% FAP). While never sig-
nificant at 1%, it is interesting to note all indicators show a peak
at 125 d; log(R′
HK ) even shows a doublet at 119 d, which are the
aliases pair for a sampling frequency of 1000 d.
For HD 304636, we have a peak in log( R′
HK ) and Ha 06
at 437 d (0.1% and 1% FAP, respectively). The FWHM and
log(R′
HK ) show significant power above 1500 d.
The presence of significant signals on a timescale similar to
the observing span motivates a linear fitting on the indicators
and analysis of the residuals. For HD 102365 on log( R′
HK ) and
Ha06, we detect a significant signal at ∼123 d, very similar to the
announced planet period at 122 d. On HD 3046336, the period
of 30.3 d is detected on log(R′
HK ), close to the expected rotation
period. We checked for correlations between nightly averaged
RVs and indicators using the Pearson correlation coefficient and
display these values in the radar chart in Fig 7.
The correlation coe fficients absolute values for HD 10700
and HD 304636 are below 0.4, showing weak correlations, if
present at all. On the other hand, for HD 102365 the coefficients
values range from 0.4 to 0.8. The only exception is Ha16, that is
arguably poorly adapted to this spectral type. Interestingly, for
CCF, TM, and TMb the photospheric indicators FWHM and con-
trast show a correlation of 0.7. The explained variance is given
by R2, that in the simplistic case of a linear model is given by the
square of the coefficient of correlation. In this approximation, the
correlation coefficient value of 0.7 sets an important threshold:
half of the variance is explained by the correlation. We have then
clear evidence that HD 102365 RVs are contemporaneous with
activity.
The study of periodicities of RVs and their correlations with
activity indicators is insightful but incomplete. Activity-induced
signals may not be periodic, and remain undetected in a period-
icity analysis; they can also show a time (or phase) lag relative to
the associated RV signal and thus lead to a null correlation coeffi-
cient while being physically connected (see e.g. Collier Cameron
et al. 2019, for an example on the Sun). For a complete analysis
one must model simultaneously activity and potential planetary
signals.
7. Radial velocity analysis withkima
We used the kima package22 (Faria et al. 2018) to evaluate the
number of planetary signals present in the data while considering
a realistic modelling of activity. kima uses the di ffusive nested
sampling (DNS) algorithm from Brewer et al. (2011) to sam-
ple from the posterior distribution of the model parameters; this
method delivers an estimate for the marginal likelihood for each
model and enables direct model comparisons (see e.g. Brewer
2014; Feroz et al. 2011). In this context, the number of detected
planets Np is a parameter that can be left free or fixed for the
analysis. For each model we obtain at least 50 000 effective sam-
ples from the posterior, which allows for a robust sampling of the
different parameters.

7.1. Modelling with a quasi-periodic GP
kima is able to make use of a Gaussian process (GP) with a
quasi-periodic kernel as a noise model to accurately represent
activity-induced signals; the hyper-parameters η1-η4 of the GP
are inferred together with the planetary orbital parameters, star
background velocity, and instrument-specific noise and o ffset
values. η1 is the amplitude of the GP quasi-periodic kernel, η2
is the evolution timescale, η3 the rotational period it tries to rep-
resent and η4 the signal’s harmonic complexity. This activity
signal representation has had its origin in photometric activity
modelling and has seen a large number of applications and suc-
cess on RV modelling. For an early implementation see Hay-
wood et al. (2014); for a recent revision work see Nicholson &
Aigrain (2022). The choice of priors for each of the parameters
is discussed in detail in Appendix G.1 and listed in Table G.1.
The best-fit parameters for the different stars and RV calcula-
tion methods is presented in Table G.2. Using the quasi-periodic
kernel and the previously mentioned priors we could reproduce
a rotation-modulated activity signal with a period close to the
expected Prot value, as listed in Table 5.
Letting the number of planets free between zero and one, no
significant planetary signals were detected on any of the stars us-
ing any of the RV calculation methods. We repeated the analysis
fixing the number of planets at zero to obtain the best characteri-
sation of stellar activity; the posteriors for the case with variable
planet number and fixing planet number at zero are almost iden-
tical. For a given star, the results across RV calculation methods
are also very similar; the only exception are forη3 and η4 that for
the CCF RV of HD 10700 are very poorly constrained. The distri-
bution of the key parameters for the TM RV calculation methods,
with and without planets, are shown in Figure 8.
The modelling on HD 10700 can be interpreted as success-
ful for several reasons. The best-fit rotational period η3 is of ap-
proximately 42 d, halfway between the 38 d Prot value estimate
from spectroscopic calibrations and the 46 d value from interfer-

ometric studies (see Sect 3). Not only a rotation period but a first
harmonic are detected, and an evolution timescale η2 maximum
is found at 2.5 times the rotation period, compatible with what
is observed on the Sun (Collier Cameron et al. 2019). Moreover,
the jitter on the long timespan dataset ESPR19 and η1 parameter
distributions are approximately normal and have values of 45-
50 cm/s. However, η4 is of 2.2 for the CCF dataset, which can
lead to a degeneracy in the activity signal characterisation (as
discussed on Appendix G.1). The RV o ffsets for the three stars
are of the order of m/s, compatible with zero, and mutually com-
patible across RV calculation methods.
The corner plots are presented on Appendix G.5, and show
correlation between di fferent parameters. The linear slope and
quadratic term of the stellar systemic trend are mutually corre-
lated and correlated with the instrumental o ffset; the quadratic
term is correlated with the systemic velocity. The jitter parame-
ters for the three stars are slightly correlated with their GP pa-
rameters η2 and η4, with the correlations being less pronounced
for HD 10700. The correlation between jitter and η2 / η4 occurs
when the jitter is very small and the timescales very short (with
η2 similar to the rotation period), and η4 is at its lowest limit,
creating a signal with very low complexity.
The classification of a detection as significant depends on the
(Keplerian) planet model being favoured, which in turn depends
on a chosen metric crossing an a-priori threshold. For exoplanet
detection within the Bayesian Framework, the metric is typically
the Bayes factor and the threshold 150 (Kass & Raftery 1995).
While no star shows a significant detection, the posterior on the
number of planets of HD 10700 has a similar number of samples
for Np = 1 than for Np = 0. The posterior of the orbital period
and the joint posterior of semi-amplitude period and eccentric-
ity period for TM are shown in Fig. G.1. There is a pile-up of
samples at periods of ∼1 d and ∼20 d; when looking at the semi-

amplitude, we see that these extend from 15 to 60 cm/s, with the
eccentricity extending up to around 0.6. This cluster of poste-
rior parameters does not correspond then to a well-characterised
and well-defined signal, but are very variable parametrisations of
tentative detections. The posteriors for the CCF RVs are similar,
with a third clustering at a period of one year.
7.1.1. Changing the priors: Highly constrained planet
searches
The comparison between planetary model and non-planetary
model depends on the assumed priors. In particular, an or-
bital period constrained to regions of high likelihood (e.g.,
periodogram peaks) can boost the posterior evidence for the
planetary model when compared to a wider parameter search.
Whether the narrow priors have a physically sound justification
remains a separate question.
To test the presence of planets in this skewed scenario we
consider three cases of narrow searches around 20, 122, and
7.57 d for HD 10700, HD 102365, and HD 304636, respectively.
We consider Gaussian priors around these periods, with a stan-
dard deviation of 20% of the chosen period value. For HD 10700
we choose the TM and for HD 102365 and HD 304636 we choose
the TMr datasets as optimistic cases. The results remain largely
unchanged; there is no significant planet detection even in this
scenario.
7.1.2. Changing the model: Quasi-periodic joint kernel with
FWHM
We tested a joint modelling of RV and FWHM, as used in Faria
et al. (2022). The FWHM is known to track activity changes in
a wide range of scenarios, but in our study it only shows a sig-
nificant correlation with RVs for HD 102365. None of the three
stars has an RV or indicator time series with a significant period-
icity at the expected stellar rotational period. This model is tried
thus for purely exploratory reasons, without having any a priori
support from data inspection.
In our joint model the parameters η2 and η3 are shared be-
tween the RVs and FWHM variation, as a way of anchoring
the rotational period and the evolution timescale. The parameter
ηFWHM ,1 is drawn from a log-Uniform between 0.1 and the maxi-
mum FWHM variation and the parameterηFWHM ,4 is drawn from
the same prior asη4. The rest of the analysis remains unchanged.
The joint model results are presented in Table G.2, and the
posterior distributions are very similar to those seen in the previ-
ous section. For HD 10700 the only noticeable difference occurs
for η3, that now has a very skewed distribution towards small
values. For HD 102365 η1 and η4 show larger values than seen
in the previous section; η4 being larger than 2.0 is associated
with a higher model degeneracy. For HD 304636 the posteriors
are compatible, but the parameters η2, η3 and η4 show narrower
posteriors, indicating this model provides increased constraints.
7.2. Telluric correction and its impact on RVs
Telluric water absorption features are present across the optical
domain and as such cannot be masked out without a considerable
loss in RV precision. With a small relative depth ( <2%) these
are often referred to as micro-tellurics, and are expected to have
an impact on RVs that is larger than 10 cm /s over a wide range
of conditions (target spectral types, airmass, precipitable water
vapour content on the atmosphere), reaching up to 80 cm /s on
extreme cases. For more on the topic, we refer to Cunha et al.
(2014).
Allart et al. (2022) presented a telluric absorption correc-
tion model of ESPRESSO and tested it on a smaller dataset on
HD 10700 than present here, identifying an e ffect on RVs that
was of the order of 10 cm /s rms, could reach a maximum value
of 58 cm/s, and had a significant impact on the detection of sig-
nals with a period close to one year.
Since CCF and TM are subject to di fferent telluric masking
criteria, water micro-tellurics are a prime candidate for the mod-
ulation seen in ∆(CCF - TM) (see Sect. 6.1). To test for this hy-
pothesis and attempt a gain in RV precision we apply the CCF
and S-BART RV computation to telluric-corrected spectra of
HD 10700.
We tested different telluric masking conditions on S-BART;
on top of the baseline choice of masking regions affected by tel-
lurics deeper than 1%, we alternatively masked water features
to deeper than 25%, 40%, and 50%. The masking of non-water
features remained fixed at 1%. Since there is a larger density of
water features in the redder optical wavelengths, the scatter of
TMr is the most efficient metric for an improved correction. We
notice that for the 25% threshold there is a reduction in 6-8 cm/s,
and a negligible reduction for deeper thresholds. For 25% one
also has a reduction of 2-3 cm /s rms in the TM. This is in line
with the correction being at its most e ffective for shallow water
lines, as intended. We keep then this threshold as our nominal
S-BART correction threshold.
The night scatter for the telluric corrected spectra is pre-
sented in Table 9, and the rms can be compared directly with
that of Table 8. The scatter onCCFtc remains the same when com-
pared with the uncorrected one very probably because the corre-
lation masks were not extended in wavelength to make use of
the now corrected wavelength range. An LS of the uncorrected-
corrected CCF RVs and indicators show clear peaks at one year
and fractions of it (Fig G.2), illustrating nonetheless the positive
impact of the correction.
The kima analysis using the same model and priors as in
Sect. 7 on the telluric corrected RVs is presented in Table G.3.
The telluric correction allows us to reach lower ESPR19 jitter
values for the different TM runs, between 41 and 45 cm/s.

7.3. Compatibility limits
When running kima one can fix Np to the number of detected
planets plus one to calculate the parameters of undetected plan-
ets that are compatible with the data (see Standing et al. 2022).
The samples with the largest planet semi-major axis amplitude,
K0, in a given period bin will yield the most massive planet com-
patible with the data and with the priors. The compatibility limits
produced in this way have important advantages when compared
with the traditional detection limits from the injection-recovery
method: the different orbital parameters are marginalised by con-
struction and the results do not depend on signal injection prop-
erties. We calculate and compare the compatibility limits for the

different RV time series in Fig. 9; for HD 10700 and HD 102365
we mark the parameters of the planets announced in the litera-
ture.
Fig. 9: Compatibility limits for the three stars studied, HD 10700
(top), HD 102365 (middle), and HD 304636 (bottom). The max-
imum semi-major RV amplitude of the samples is plotted for
each of the RV calculation methods model, and telluric correc-
tion set; HZ limits as presented in Tab. 5 and orbital properties
of announced planed described in Sect. 2 are shown.
For a given star the results for the di fferent RV calculation
methods are similar but not identical. For HD 10700, as we in-
crease in period we have a first bump (increase in equivalent
planetary mass) at around 20 d, the value of the posterior pile-
up we saw in Sect. 7.1, and the period of an announced planet.
For periods longer than 300 d the CCF RV calculation method
shows a lower detection capability than the others, unfortunately
for periods covering the star’s HZ. However, using the telluric-
corrected version of the RVs corrects for this e ffect, creating an
almost linear limit between 100 and 1000 d. While the gain is the
most pronounced for CCF, it is also present for the other reduc-
tions. For HD 102365 and HD 304636 TMr provides the lowest
(i.e., most sensitive) limits. For HD 102365 this is interpreted as
the red wavelengths being less sensitive to star’s activity. The
different RV time series and di fferent models yield slightly dif-
ferent compatibility limits, with the bumps showing a di fferent
amplitude; this points to these being created by the spurious fit-
ting of activity signals. For HD 304636 we obtain very similar
detection limits when comparing pairwise CCF – TMb and TM –
TMr. We can speculate that this is probably due to the template
matching being more efficient at extracting RVs from M-dwarfs,
that have most of the spectral information on the red detector,
with the CCF being more similar to the information on the blue
detector. This could be the e ffect of activity at play, leading to
slightly lower limits measured withTMr than TM. For this star we
have a clear bump at 30-40 d, the expected rotational period of
the star.
For each star we need to choose an RV calculation method to
define the most representative compatibility limit. For HD 10700
we choose TM as is the one that best constraints the GP parame-
ters, while allowing for a lower detection limit to be reached up
to the HZ. For HD 102365 and HD 304636 the lowest detection
limits are obtained with TMr, that we thus select. A summary
of the compatibility limits mass for key periods is shown in Ta-
ble 10. For HD 10700 we are below 1 M⊕for periods shorter than
10 d and at 1.7 M⊕for periods shorter than 100 d; within the HZ
we are sensitive to planets with a minimum mass above 2.5 to
5 M⊕, approximately.

ence periods and the HZ period range.

7.4. RV stability and precision floor
Any RV variability not parametrised by η1 - η4 will be captured
by the jitter term of each dataset. While the datasetESPR18 spans
only 150 days, ESPR19 spans almost 4 years, with the data clus-
tered into the months when a star is observable from Paranal
observatory.
For a further inspection of ESPRESSO stability and the RV
precision limit of our model we take HD 10700 telluric corrected
data and subdivide ESPR19 into four yearly datasets ESPRy19 -
ESPRy22, with 20 to 33 points each, timespans in the range 70-
230 d, and temporal gaps between subsets from 120 to 270 days,
approximately. We use the previously described quasi-periodic
kernel and priors within the GP to reproduce the RVs derived
with the di fferent methods. The ad-hoc separation leads to the
derivation of five jitter values and four o ffset ones; their poste-

riors are presented as box plots in Fig 10. The dataset properties
and measured values are presented in Table 11.
The result from the different RVs is, once again, compatible;
we focus our analysis on the results for TM. While the jitter for
ESPR18 remains at 73 cm/s, for ESPRy19 - ESPRy22 this is of
32, 38, 23, and 57 cm /s, respectively. The datasets have di ffer-
ent number of points and span, with ESPRy20 being particularly
small and short; the results on it can be affected by small-number
statistics. Nonetheless, the di fferent sub-datasets show variable
jitter, up to a factor of 2 to 3.5, depending on the reduction. The
reason for the difference is unclear, and can come from either a
variation in instrument stability or induced stellar activity. The
different reductions have a minimum yearly timescale jitter be-
tween 20 cm/s and 30 cm/s.
8. Discussion
8.1. A forward model of pulsations
The asteroseismology of main sequence stars experienced sig-
nificant developments over recent decades. We refer to García &
Ballot (2019) for a comprehensive review of the topic. Our work
uses simple principles and scaling equations to estimate the con-
tribution of p-mode pulsations to averaged intra-night RVs and
intra-night RV scatter. We take into consideration the time inter-
vals covered by individual exposures and the detector readout-
time gaps in the acquisition of consecutive integrations, as used
in RV searches, and use individual p-mode frequencies instead
of an envelope to represent the ensemble of oscillations. These
two aspects are certainly behind the very good match with obser-
vations, and key differences between our others such as Chaplin
et al. (2019).
Some important shortcomings apply. There have been re-
ports of significant correlations between surface activity indica-
tors and solar-like oscillations properties for the Sun, with the
oscillation frequencies increasing during higher activity periods.
The commonly accepted explanation is that magnetic fields in-
duce perturbations in the outer layers of the star, influencing the
oscillation cavity of the p-modes. The exact mechanism behind
this frequency shift remains unknown; see Howe (2008) and ref-
erences therein. In addition, several other p-mode characteristics
such as amplitude and widths change within an activity cycle
(e.g. Salabert et al. 2011). A similar mechanism may be at play
and detectable at very high RV precision.
Asteroseismology enables the measurement of stellar param-
eters with exquisite accuracy. We could compare our own param-
eter estimation against those provided by asteroseismology runs
for HD 10700 and reached an excellent agreement. It was pre-
cisely on this very well-characterised star that we were able to
reproduce pulsations scatter to better than 10 cm /s. We cannot
know if the mismatch between simulations and observed values
for HD 102365 and HD 20794 comes from a higher activity im-
pact on pulsations or from poorly determined parameters; either
can be responsible for the mismatch, without one having to in-
voke additional sources of intra-night scatter.
In the last section we saw that for the GP model on telluric-
corrected HD 10700 RVs using TM / TMb / TMr the best estimate
for the jitter of ESPR19 (measured over 3.5 yr) was of approx-
imately 40 cm/s. This value is very similar the intra-night scat-
ter generated by pulsations. The similarity might be coinciden-
tal, but in the worst-case scenario can be the consequence of
the pulsations intra-night scatter not being averaged, and thus
being present in the nightly averaged dataset. To test that the
pulsations were effectively averaged out, we binned the data of
HD 10700 considering only 3 points per night for the time series
TM / TMb / TMr (with the actual points selected being randomly
drawn from the available within each night). While the photon
noise of the averaged points increases, it remains below 15 cm/s.
The jitter on ESPR18 and ESPR19 increases to 85 and 45 cm /s,
approx, pointing to an additional source of noise of 30-40 cm /s,
with the other parameters remaining very similar. These tests re-
inforce the idea that the stellar pulsations signal were signifi-
cantly averaged out.
8.2. Granulation’s signature and impact
Our understanding of the detailed physical mechanisms creating
granulation RV signatures remains poor and has historically been
influenced by the phenomenological characterisation of granula-
tion coming from photometry. In the direct comparison in Fig. 4
of García & Ballot (2019) the photometry shows a very clear
shape and knees that allow for the fitting of Harvey functions for
granulation, while for RV the location, amplitude and presence
of the different components is still not firmly established.
A Harvey function with α= 2, as commonly used for
parametrising granulation, is a Cauchy distribution. This is a
well-known pathological distribution, with both expected value
and variance undefined; if we draw samples from this distri-
bution, the sample average does not converge. This provides a
simple mathematical explanation as to why the many works that
simulate granulation from such prescription do not measure an
increase in planetary detection capability when stacking up a
very large number of observations (e.g. Meunier et al. 2023).
The expected granulation signature is clearly not detected in
the intra-night scatter of HD 10700, being still compatible with
those of HD 102365 and HD 304636. On the other hand, the
predicted impact of super-granulation on average RVs, of 65-
75 cm/s rms, is above the long-term stability of 40 cm /s mea-
sured on HD 10700. Our jitter measurement imposes then strin-
gent constraints on granulation signals modelling and parametri-
sations.
8.3. A different signature: low-amplitude white-light flares
Main sequence stars with spectral types A to M exhibit flares,
associated with events of magnetic reconnection in the solar
corona. It has long been know that flares are detected predomi-
nantly on M dwarfs (e.g. Yang & Liu 2019). However, a compar-
ison of flare size distributions on di fferent hosts show these are
mutually compatible across spectral types and with the distri-
bution measured on the Sun (Aschwanden & Güdel 2021). This
points towards detectability as the main source for the difference.

stars show flares. The distribution of the duration of the flares
peaks at 50 min and has a long queue up to several hours. The
amplitude of the vast majority of the detected flares is of lower
than 10% of the continuum flux, with the number of flares as a
function of energy following a power-law.
In their seminal work on the physics of flares, Lu & Hamil-
ton (1991) argue that the observed power-law dependence stems
from the solar coronal magnetic field being in a self-organised
critical state. In this scenario, solar flares are avalanches of many
small reconnection events, where the size of a given flare is de-
termined by the number of elementary reconnection events, and
explaining why the phenomenon extends over more than five or-
ders of magnitude in peak flux.
White-light flares are expected to extend to much lower am-
plitude than currently detected, and at a much higher frequency.
These low-amplitude flares are expected to have an RV sig-
nature, that unfortunately has not been characterised yet. The
recent work of Pietrow et al. (2024) compares flaring activ-
ity with contemporaneous HARPS-N and concludes that flares,
if present, should have an RV signature below 50 cm /s. The
timescale of 50 min measured on TESS photometry matches the
knee on the power spectrum of solar RVs as measured by Al
Moulla et al. (2023), and the power spectrum of these phenom-
ena have been characterised by a Harvey function with α= 2
(see Hudson 1991). One can speculate that small-amplitude
white light flares contribute to the RV variability measured by
ESPRESSO at 40 cm /s. However, without a detailed study or
benchmark on the impact of small-amplitude white-light flares
it remains impossible to quantify the contribution.
8.4. Stellar signals or planets
The RV analysis of periodic signals only showed a significant
signal at around 20 d for HD 10700, and under specific noise as-
sumptions (without other sources of variance than photon noise).
Being located close to an harmonic of the expected rotational
period, at 42 d, the physical origin of this signal remains hard
to assess. The best-match planet parameters posteriors show an
over density of samples at this period. However, the RV ampli-
tude of the signal varies from 15 to 60 cm /s, and is at the edge
of our compatibility limits. The posterior of the GPη3 parameter
shows also a local maximum at 20 d, which could be a spuri-
ous fit to a planetary signal or simply the harmonic of the star
rotational period at 42 d. The detection in RV of the first har-
monics of the rotation period is well documented in the litera-
ture (e.g., Dumusque et al. 2017; Suárez Mascareño et al. 2017;
Georgieva et al. 2023) and is even expected under some stellar
configurations (Boisse et al. 2011). The recent work of Korolik
et al. (2023) shows that HD 10700 is observed practically pole-
on, and there are examples on the literature of pole-on stars like
Vega that show a first-harmonic RV signature of the rotational
period (Hurt et al. 2021). However, without a detailed character-
isation of the star’s active regions, the modelling of the activity
signal and confirmation of this hypothesis remains out of reach.
The GP delivers a very low jitter value of ∼40 cm/s to ESPR19
over 3.5 yr, to which contribute uncharacterised RV e ffects and
undetected signals.
It is possible to make a comparison of these results with those
obtained by Feng et al. (2017b) using the compatibility limits
shown in Figure 9. The planets announced at 20.0 d (1.75 M ⊕)
and 49.4 d (1.83 M⊕) are very close to the detection limit. The
3.93 M⊕planet at 162 d should have been detected with our anal-
ysis, while the announced planet at 636 d is below our detec-
tion limits. In a nutshell, our data and analysis remains com-
patible with Feng et al. (2017b) on the potential presence of a
signal at 20 d. However, we do not find significant evidence to
call it a detection, and cast some doubts on its planetary origin
(even if confirmed). Our results do not support the presence of
a 3.93 M⊕ planet at 162 d as previously announced. When in-
terpreting the discrepancy in detected planets and detectability
estimates between HARPS and ESPRESSO one should consider
that HARPS can reach an intrinsic precision of down to 60 cm/s
(see Lovis et al. 2006, for one of the first results). As such the
detection of Earth-mass planets up to hundred days remains ex-
tremely difficult when done with HARPS, even with extensive
datasets and the most advanced analysis.
The detailed study of HD 102365 by Tinney et al. (2011) was
motivated by the large measured RV scatter (∼3 m/s) when com-
pared to the expected RV scatter on the star. The work of Suárez
Mascareño et al. (2017) yields an an activity-induced RV semi-

amplitude of only 41 cm/s for the mean value of log(R′
HK ), giving
the star a privileged status for RV studies.
However, our ESPRESSO data shows clear evidence for
activity-induced RV . First of all, the RV scatter doubled from
ESPR18 to ESPR19. The LS of BIS, log( R′
HK ) and Ha 06 show
signals almost reaching an FAP of 1% ate 123 d. Very impor-
tantly, the correlation between nightly averaged indicators and
RV shows that half of the RV variance can be attributed to the
correlation between an indicator and RV .
Finally, our kima analysis shows no evidence for the pres-
ence of a planet of 16 M⊕on a 122 days period orbit. The com-
patibility limits, calculated under the assumption of rotation-
period informed GP model, show no candidate signals at this
period and amplitude compatible with the ESPRESSO RV data.
Therefore, we consider the 122-123 d signal as having a stellar
origin.
The M star HD 304636 does not show a clear rotational pe-
riod modulation in photometry, or on any spectral activity in-
dicator. The kima analysis lead to a non-Gaussian jitter dis-
tribution for ESPR18 and poor detection limits around the ex-
pected rotational period of 30-40 d. A natural question is if the
ESPRESSO data can provide further information on the TESS
candidate found at 7.57 d. We used Forecaster (Chen & Kip-
ping 2017) that for the radius of ∼0.87 R⊕ delivers a planetary
mass of ∼0.58 M⊕. This value is well below the 1.5 M ⊕ (for 5
days) and 1.7 M⊕(for 10 days) compatibility limits found in this
work, showing that the detection of such a planet is beyond our
ability.
The kima model of the three stars delivers a compatible
RV slope; this common behavior suggests a long-term varia-
tion of instrumental RV . The best characterisation is provided
by HD 10700, delivering an RV slope of around 30 cm/s per year
with an uncertainty of 10 cm/s.
It should be stated that the different RV calculationsCCF, TM,
TMb and TMr have different sensitivities to telluric contamina-
tion. This comes first as a consequence of the different method’s
selection or exclusion of contaminated wavelength regions, but
also due to the template matching calculating a unique template
for a dataset. We showed that using telluric correction provides
appreciable gains for HD 10700, but a finer analysis on a wide
range of targets can be done.
As a concluding remark, we note that while HD 10700 and
HD 102365 have very similar activity values as measured by the
most common indicators, the stars show a very different RV scat-
ter and a di fferent correlation level between indicators and RV .
Moreover, they are modelled with kima with very different suc-
cess, both in terms of the posteriors reached and the final jitter
value reached. This exemplifies how the a priori measurement
of activity indicators is still insufficient when selecting the most
suitable stars for the detection of Earth-mass planets. This con-
clusion expands the results of the systematic study of Gomes da
Silva et al. (2021), where it was shown that low-activity stars are
not necessarily low-variability stars.
9. Conclusions
We present a study of main sequence stars using ESPRESSO
GTO data. We started with a stellar characterisation using com-
plementary methods to draw a complete picture of the stars. The
RVs were derived from the ESPRESSO spectra with the CCF
and TM methods and ancillary photospheric and chromospheric
activity indicators.
We were able to study the intra-night RV behaviour on the
three G-K stars with multiple consecutive exposures per night.
We compared the measured RV signals with the expected scatter
from pulsations and granulation. We reached a very good match
between the predicted RV variability from oscillations and mea-
sured RV down to a level of better or equal to 10 cm /s, with an
additional scatter that might be attributed to poor stellar param-
eter determination or the impact of activity on oscillations.
A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets
supported by the data, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic
GP can model the activity signal. A rotationally modulated sig-
nal close to the expected period was modelled for the three stars,
with the analysis for HD 10700 being particularly successful in
reproducing the observed data. A planetary signal at a period
of 20 d could be modelled along with it, but the evidence for
its presence is not significant. Moreover, its physical origin re-
main uncertain due to the similarity between this period and
the first harmonic of rotation. ESPRESSO data on their own do
not provide conclusive evidence for planets around HD 10700,
HD 102365, or HD 304636. This is at odds with the detection by
Tinney et al. (2011) of a 123 d period planet with 16M ⊕around
HD 102365, which would clearly have been revealed by our data.
The latest analysis of Feng et al. (2017b) on HD 10700 HARPS
archive data also predicts a planet with 3.93 M ⊕ planet at 162 d
that while within our detection capabilities is not detected, with
our analysis casting a different interpretation on the 20 d signal.
Our RV analysis allowed us to detect planets around HD 10700
down to 1.7 M⊕for periods up to 100 d and of 2-5M⊕within the
star’s habitable zone. As data analysis progresses, these values
are expected to decrease.
In this work, ESPRESSO demonstrates an on-sky RV preci-
sion of better 10 cm/s on short time-scales (<1 h) and of around
40 cm/s on a timescale of 3.5 yr on HD 10700 telluric-corrected
spectra. By further further splitting the datasets, we estimated
that the RV stability over a timescale of one year can be as low
as 25-30 cm/s, variable from year to year.
The convective phenomena of granulation were modelled
with literature prescriptions that unfortunately do not reproduce
the level of scatter we observed in this work. In particular, the
parametrisations of super-granulation overestimate the scatter
measured in our RVs for HD 10700, which provides strong con-
straints for detailed modelling in future studies. The analysis
presented here illustrates the significant di fferences among stel-
lar RV signatures when analysed at sub-m /s level. It underlines
the fact that no current activity indicator allows us to select RV-
stable stars in advance for searches at better than 1 m/s.

Figueira et al. (2025): ESPRESSO’s RVs down to the 10 cm/s level
Appendix A:ARIADNE priors and input photometry
For the effective temperature, log(g), and [Fe /H] ARIADNE uses
as priors the observed parameter distributions from the fifth
RA VE survey data release (Kunder et al. 2017). A Normal dis-
tribution centred around the Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) value and
with a standard deviation of 5 times the associated uncertainty
is used as prior for the distance. As we wanted to retain uninfor-
mative priors we kept these default choices; for a full description
we refer to Vines & Jenkins (2022). Since the distance to these
stars is at maximum 10 pc, we fixed the extinction coefficient Av
at 0, in what is our only informed choice.
The photometry and associated uncertainties retrieved for the
four stars is presented on Table A.1. Since 2MASS J, H, and
Ks photometry is saturated for magnitudes below 4.5, 4, and
3.5, respectively, we exclude from the analysis of HD 10700,
HD 20794, and HD 102365 the 2MASS data23.
Gaia DR3 photometric measurements are also a ffected for
saturation for bright targets. Nonetheless, the consortium pro-
vides a correction formula readily applicable to our case, de-
scribed in Riello et al. (2021), Appendix C1. Following this cor-
rection all Gaia magnitudes could be used.
Appendix B: Rotational period derived assuming
different spectral types
For the sake of completeness and comparison, we computed
the rotational period using the calibrations of Suárez Mascareño
et al. (2016) for each star’s estimated spectral type, closest class,
plus GKM’s as a whole. For log(R′
HK ) we use the value derived
by Hojjatpanah et al. (2019). The results are shown in Table B.1.

spectral classes.

Appendix C:S-BART application to ESPRESSO data
for high-precision radial velocities
The specifics of our application of S-BART to ESPRESSO data
can be summed up as follows:
– the method assumes a common RV value for the individ-
ual orders and slices of the instrument. In this context, the
two ESPRESSO slices of each interference order are treated
as two independent measurements, ignoring the correlations
between the two orders flux values and their uncertainties;
– To decrease the impact of micro-telluric features on the stel-
lar template, only observations taken at an airmass smaller
than 1.6 are considered for the template construction.
– S-BART masks wavelength regions to prevent spectral con-
tamination from Earth’s atmosphere on the spectra, that leads
to parasite e ffects on RV . A reference synthetic transmit-
tance profile is constructed with TELFIT (Gullikson et al.
2014) at a resolution of 140000 for the wavelength range of
23 See https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/
allsky/doc/sec1_6b.html for detailed information.
ESPRESSO; the airmass, stellar RV and precipitable water
vapour of the observation with the highest relative humidity
are assumed as worst-case scenario for each star. Wavelength
bins with a transmission lower than 99% relative to the con-
tinuum and within the maximum yearly BERV variation ( ∼
30 km/s) are masked out. This mask is applied to both the
construction of the stellar template and the calculation of the
individual RVs. This criteria leads to discarding 36 out of the
170 slices of ESPRESSO.
– two independent templates are generated for the two inde-
pendent datasets ESPR18 and ESPR19;
– When discarding wavelength domains, and to ensure that
the RV measurements are informed by the same spectral re-
gions, we consider only orders accepted for bothESPR18 and
ESPR19.

of this simulation is done, one can evaluate the distribution of
nightly averaged RVs and RV scatter (rms), as seen in Fig. D.3.

Appendix E: Granulation measurements and
simulations
Dumusque et al. (2011) used HARPS asteroseismology data on
the stars βHyi, αCen A, µAra, and τCet and fitted the PSD with
Harvey and Lorentzian function, applying to RV the same prin-
ciples studied in detail in photometry. In a more recent work
Al Moulla et al. (2023) used HARPS and HARPS-N solar tele-
scopes RV data and fitted two Harvey functions to represent
granulation on the RV’s power density spectrum. While Du-
musque et al. (2011) fitted three granulation signals, Al Moulla
et al. (2023) fitted two, and the power-law slope αwas fixed at
2.0 to avoid degeneracy and because this value reproduced well
the observational data. The results are summarised in Table E.1.
From the proposed scaling relationships one gets that the am-
plitude and granulation timescales are proportional to ∆ν; yet,
for αCen A and mu Ara, two stars with very similar large fre-
quency separations, the parametrisations of granulation obtained
by Dumusque et al. (2011) is very di fferent. This can be a con-
sequence of poor time sampling of the phenomenon or the poor
granulation modelling, but one should also consider that the scal-
ing model could be inaccurate, as suggested already in Mathur
et al. (2011) .
Appendix F: FAP fromℓ1 analysis
The FAP as estimated from ℓ1 analysis for the three stars is pre-
sented in Tables F.1, F.2, and F.3.
Appendix G:kima analysis
Appendix G.1: Description of prior distributions
We use non-informative priors as much as possible, including
only information available from simple summary statistics and
the previously determined rotation periods listed in Table 5.
The modified log-uniform distribution is a log-uniform dis-
tribution with parameters knee a and upper limit b, introduced
by Gregory (2005). Using the modified version allows us to ex-
tend the prior to zero, assigning non-zero probability to values
below the knee value. For the planet semi-major amplitude we
use a modified log-uniform prior with a knee at 10 cm /s and an
upper limit of 10 m/s.
For the period we use a log-uniform prior from 1 to 1000 d.
The eccentricity is represented with a Kumaraswamy (1980) dis-
tribution which is an approximation to the β distribution pro-
posed in Kipping (2013). For the mean anomaly and argument
of periastron we use uniform distributions between 0 and 2π.
For the stars systemic RV and the instrument-related param-
eters we derive the priors from the datasets: the systemic RV is
taken from a uniform distribution between the RV extreme val-
ues, and the jitter from a uniform distribution between 5 cm/s to
5 m/s. The offset is drawn from a uniform distribution between
minus and plus the RV span value. The linear and quadratic
slopes are zero-centred normal distributions with variance given
by the data dispersion.

plexity. η2 represents the timescale of coherence of the active
regions. The adimensional parameter η4 governs the short-scale
variation of the GP relative to the rotation timescaleη3; a smaller
value of η4 indicates a higher number of short-scale structures
within a single stellar rotation period. For further information of
the quasi-periodic kernel GP and on GPs in general, we refer to
Rasmussen & Williams (2006) and Roberts et al. (2012).
It is worth mentioning that this GP model has several poten-
tially degenerate variables. Equation G.1 is basically the product
of two exponential functions: the term with η3 and η4, designed
to represent the periodic part with higher harmonic complexity,
and the term with η2, intended to represent the temporal evo-
lution. However, for a small temporal di fference relative to the
putative period (t −t′)/η3, when 2πη2 = η3η4 there is a potential
issue24. Since η2 ≥η3, for η4 < 1 there is no confusion; how-
ever, when η4 > 1 there is a degeneracy between the terms that
intend to represent temporal evolution and periodic behaviour.
Moreover, for very low or high values of harmonic complexity
η4, the final function is not quasi-periodic. For η4 ≪1 the func-
tion will contain a very large number of peak-to-valley variations
per timescale η3, while for η4 ≫1 the function will be constant
over timespans much longer than η3, and including the GP cor-
responds to simply adding a second component of white noise.
The term of harmonic complexity η4 has its origin from the tem-
poral evolution of spot complexes as seen in photometry, but its
usage in RV is far from trivial. The exact value is hard to recover
24 This is obtained by making the change of variable x=π(t−t′)/η3, and
approximating sin(x) ∼x.

even when injected on simulated RV datasets, and its interpre-
tation at the physical level is not trivial; for a discussion on the
subject, we refer to Nicholson & Aigrain (2022).
For η1 we consider a uniform distribution between 5 cm /s
and 5 m/s. For the rotation timescale η3 we use a Normal dis-
tribution centred at P rot and with standard deviation σ as the
period’s estimated uncertainties, with the two variables as pre-
sented in Table B.1. For the evolution timescale parameterη2 we
consider a Uniform distribution between 1 and 5×the rotational
period. There is little information about this parameter on stars
other than the Sun, but on our star the values of η2 are assumed
to be a few times the rotation period. Forη4 we choose a uniform
between 0.2 and 5.
All priors are listed in Table G.1.
