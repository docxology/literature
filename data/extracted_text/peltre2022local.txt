Abstract
A statistical system is classically deﬁned on a set of microstates E by a global energy function
H : E →R, yielding Gibbs probability measures (softmins) ρβ(H) for every inverse temperature
β = T−1. Gibbs states are simultaneously characterised by free energy principles and the max-
entropy principle, with dual constraints on inverse temperatureβand mean energy U(β) = Eρβ[H]
respectively. The Legendre transform relates these diverse variational principles [1, 2] which are
unfortunately not tractable in high dimension.
We here consider a ﬁnite free sheaf E : P(Ω)op →Set of microstates, deﬁned by Ea = ∏
i∈a Ei
for every region a ⊆ Ω, whose size grows exponentially with Ω. The global energy function
H : E →R is assumed given as a sum H(x) = ∑
a⊆Ω ha(x|a) of local short-range interactions
ha : Ea →R, indexed by bounded subregions. The cluster variational method (CVM) [3, 4, 5] can
then be used to estimate the global free energy F(β) = −1
β ln ∑e−βH, by searching for critical
points of a localised approximation of a variational free energy. These critical points can be found
by generalised belief propagation (GBP) algorithms, according to a correspondence theorem ini-
tially conjectured by Yedidia et al [6, 7]. The proof of this theorem [8, 9] involved combinatorial
and topological structures acting on dual complexes of local observables and local measures, on
which continuous-time diﬀusion equations gave new message-passing algorithms regularising GBP
[9, 10].
We now show that stationary states of GBP algorithms solve a collection of equivalent variational
principles on local Bethe-Kikuchi functionals, which approximate the free energy F(β), the Shan-
non entropy S(U), and the variational free energy F(β) = U− β−1S(U) respectively. This local
form of Legendre duality yields a possibly degenerate relationship between the constraints Uand
β, exhibiting singularities on loopy hypergraphs where GBP converges to multiple equilibria.
1 Local statistical systems: topology and combinatorics
Consider a ﬁnite free sheaf E : P(Ω)op →Set of microstates, deﬁned for every region a ⊆Ω by
Ea = ∏
i∈a Ei. For every b ⊆a the natural restriction πa→b : Ea →Eb forgets the state of variables
outside b, we write xa|b = πa→b(xa). We recall necessary deﬁnitions and theorems from [9] in this
section.
Local observables form a cosheaf 1 RE : P(Ω) →Algc of commutative algebras, whose arrows
consist of natural inclusions REb ⊆REa when identifying each local algebra with a low dimensional
subspace of RE. Let us write ˜ha
b(xa) = hb(xa|b) when the extension should be made explicit. Given a
hypergraph K ⊆P(Ω), one can deﬁne a chain complex of local observables [9, Chapter 3] [13] indexed
by the nerve of K:
C0(K,RE)
δ
←−C1(K,RE)
δ
←−...
δ
←−Cn(K,RE) (1)
1In the sense that REa⊔b = REa ⊗ REb for every disjoint pair a ,b ⊆ Ω. The tensor product ⊗ is a coproduct in the
category of commutative algebras Algc, and REa = ⊗i∈aREi can be identiﬁed with a colimit in Algc.

An element of C0(K,RE) is a collection [ ha : Ea →R|a ∈K] and an element of C1(K,RE) is a
collection [ϕa→b : Eb →R|a,b ∈K, a ⊃b]: they are statistical analogs of energy densities and heat
ﬂuxes respectively. The boundary operator δ: C1(K,RE) →C0(K,RE) acts like a divergence:
δϕb(xb) =
∑
a⊃b
ϕa→b(xb) −
∑
b⊃c
ϕb→c(xb|c) (2)
We showed in [9] that stationary points of GBP algorithms can be found by diﬀusion equations of the
form dh
dt = δΦ(h), where Φ : C0(K,RE) →C1(K,RE) is a ﬂux functional satisfying some consistency
constraints [9, thm 5.13], while homology classes [ h] = h+ δC1(K,RE) explored by diﬀusion can be
characterised by a global energy conservation constraint ∑
a∈K
˜hΩ
a = HΩ [9, thm 2.13].
Local densities form a dual functor RE∗: P(Ω)op →Vect of vector spaces, whose arrows consist
of partial integrations πa→b
∗ : REa∗→REb∗, also called marginal projections. In the cochain complex
of local densities C•(K,RE)∗, the diﬀerential operator d: C0(K,RE)∗→C1(K,RE)∗acts by:
dpa→b(xb) = pb(xb) −
∑
xa|b= xb
pa(xa) (3)
Consistent densities satisfying dp= 0 are hence characterised by cohomology classes [ p] ∈Ker(d) in
C0(K,RE)∗. They can be extendend to a global measure pΩ such that pa = πΩ→a
∗ (pΩ) for all a ∈K,
although a positive pΩ may not always exist for all positive and consistent ( pa)a∈K.
The Gibbs correspondence relating potentials h ∈C0(K,RE) and beliefs p ∈C0(K,RE)∗ is es-
sential to the dynamic of GBP. Time evolution preserves the total energy [ h] while trying to enforce
consistency constraints on p, given for some choice of inverse temperature β by:
pa(xa) = 1
Za
e−βHa(xa) with Ha(xa) =
∑
b⊆a
hb(xa|b) (4)
We shall write p = ρβ(H) with H = ζ(h). Then ρβ is the non-linear Gibbs state map describing
statistical equilibrium in physics, and the zeta transform ζ, acting by local summation on subre-
gions, is a combinatorial automorphism of C0(K,RE). M¨ obius inversionformulas give an explicit
characterization of the inverse automorphism µ= ζ−1:
ha(xa) =
∑
b⊆a
µa→b Hb(xa|b) (5)
where the coeﬃcients µa→b ∈ Z solve2 inclusion-exclusion principles on the partial order ( K,⊆).
Bethe-Kikuchi coeﬃcients are deﬁned as cb = ∑
a⊇b µa→b, or equivalently by the inclusion-exclusion
principle ∑
a⊇b cb = 1 for all b ∈K. A consequence of 5 is that for any x∈E:
∑
a∈K
ha(x|a) =
∑
b∈K
cb Hb(x|b) (6)
Combinatorial theory is at the heart of Bethe approximations and hence of the CVM. It is related to a
Dirichlet convolution structure on the partial order ( K,⊆) as well described in the work of Rota [14],
who saw in M¨ obius inversion formulas a discrete analogy with the fundamental theorem of calculus.
The reciprocal pair of automorphisms (ζ,µ) can indeed be extended to the whole complex C•(K,RE),
with ζ and δ satisfy commutation relations that resemble Stokes formulas [9, chap 3].
2The matrix µcan be computed eﬃciently by iterating powers of the nilpotent operator ( ζ− 1). When K describes
a graph and has only regions of size 2, 1 and 0, one for instance has ( ζ− 1)3 = 0.

2 Cluster variational principles solved by diﬀusion
In the following, assume K ⊆P(Ω) is ﬁxed and closed by intersection. Let us introduce notations
C•= C•(K,RE) for the complex of observables, ∆ 0 ⊆C∗
0 for the convex subspace of positive beliefs,
constrained by pa ∈Prob(Ea) and pa >0 for all a ∈K, and Γ 0 = ∆0 ∩Ker(d) for the subconvex of
consistent beliefs, further constrained by dp= 0.
In this section, we deﬁne variational principles on Γ 0 and characterise the dynamical equations
one can be use to solve them. Because ρβ is not linear, the manifold Fix β = (ρβ ◦ζ)−1(Γ0) deﬁned
below is not a linear subspace of C0, despite Γ0 ⊆∆0 being a convex polytope of C∗
0 .
Deﬁnition 1. We call consistent manifold the non-linear subspace Fixβ = {v∈C0 |ρβ(ζv) ∈Γ0}for
any choice of inverse temperature β >0, and let Fix = Fix1.
Deﬁnition 2. We say that a ﬂux functional Φ : C0 →C1 is projectively faithful at β >0 iﬀ:
δΦ(v) = 0 ⇔v∈Fixβ (7)
We call Φ projectively consistent if it satisﬁes the weaker condition δΦ|Fixβ = 0.
When Φ is projectively faithful at β = 1, stationary potentials of the diﬀusion dv
dt = δΦ(v) in C0
are projected onto stationary beliefs p = ρ(ζv) ∈Γ0 of GBP [9, thm 5.15]. The purpose of GBP is
hence to ﬁnd points at the intersection of energy conservation and consistency constraint surfaces, i.e.
given initial potentials h∈C0, GBP looks for v∈[h] ∩Fix, where [h] = h+ δC1 is the homology class
of h.
The standard ﬂux functional associated to GBP is projectively faithful [9, prop 5.17] at β = 1. It
is deﬁned for every pair a ⊃b in K by:
Φ(v)a→b(xb) = −ln
∑
xa|b=xb
eVb(xb)−Va(xa) where Va(xa)
∑
b⊆a
vb(xa|b) (8)
One can nonetheless build better functionals by making use of Bethe-Kikuchi coeﬃcients [10], faithful
at least in a neighbourhood of Fix [9, prop 5.37]. A consequence of faithfulness is that stationarity of
beliefs implies stationarity of messages 3. One can hence shift the focus from messages to beliefs (or
from ﬂux terms to potentials), without losing information on GBP equilibria.
Deﬁnition 3. For every a ⊆Ω and β >0, let us introduce the following local functionals:
• Sa : Prob(Ea) →R the Shannon entropy deﬁned by Sa(pa) = −∑pa ln(pa),
• Fβ
a : Prob(Ea)×REa →R the variational free energy deﬁned by Fβ
a (pa,Ha) = Epa [Ha]−1
βSa(pa),
• Fβ
a : REa →R the free energy deﬁned by Fβ
a (Ha) = −1
β ln ∑e−βHa ,
Recall that Fβ
a (Ha) = minpa Fβ
a (pa,Ha) is the Legendre transform of Shannon entropy [1, 2, 15],
the global optimum satisfying p∗
a = ρβ
a (Ha) = Fβ
a∗(Ha), i.e. the diﬀerential Fβ
a∗: REa →REa∗ of free
energy yields Gibbs states p∗
a ∈Prob(Ea).
The Bethe-Kikuchi approximation estimates the global variational free energyFβ
Ω by a sum of local
free energy cumulants caFβ
a . This consists of a truncated M¨ obius inversion [4], whose error decays
exponentially as K ⊆P(Ω) grows coarse with respect to the range of interactions [16].
3Faithfulness hence consists of a transversality property between Im(Φ ∗) and Ker(δ).

Problem 1. Let H = ζh ∈C0 denote local energies and chose an inverse temperature β >0.
Find p∈Γ0 critical for the Bethe-Kikuchi variational energy ˇF: ∆0 ×C0 →R given by:
ˇFβ(p,H) =
∑
a∈K
ca Fβ
a (pa,Ha) (9)
The theorem of Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss [7] states that solutions of problem 1 are found by
their GBP algorithm. We shall precise this correspondence [9, theorem 4.22] below and now introduce
the two dual variational principles on entropy and free energy we are concerned with.
As in the exact global case, the max-entropy principle takes place with constraints on the Bethe-
Kikuchi mean energy:
ˇU(p,H) =
∑
a∈K
ca Epa [Ha] =
∑
a∈K
Epa [ha] = ⟨p,h⟩ (10)
For consistent p∈Γ0, the mean energy thus computed is exact by 6 and linearity of integration, errors
in Bethe-Kikuchi approximations only coming from the non-linearities of information functionals.
Problem 2. Let H = ζh ∈C0 denote local energies and chose a mean energy U∈ R.
Find p ∈Γ0 constrained to ⟨p,h⟩= Uand critical for the Bethe-Kikuchi entropy ˇS : ∆0 →R given
by:
ˇS(p) =
∑
a∈K
ca Sa(pa) (11)
Problems 1 and 2 are both variational principles onp∈Γ0, with the common consistency constraint
dp= 0 but dual temperature and energy constraints respectively. The following free energy principle
instead explores interaction potentials v∈C0 satisfying a global energy conservation constraint [ v] =
[h] ∈C0/δC1 yet at a ﬁxed temperature T = β−1.
Problem 3. Let H = ζh ∈C0 denote local energies and chose an inverse temperature β >0.
Find V = ζv ∈C0 such that v∈h+ δC1, critical for the Bethe-Kikuchi energy ˇF : C0 →R given by:
ˇFβ(V) =
∑
a∈K
ca Fβ
a (Va) (12)
We will now show that problems 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent to solving local consistency constraints
on the beliefs p = ρβ(ζv) induced by potentials v ∈h+ δC1 that satisfy the energy conservation
constraints.
3 Correspondence theorems
Solutions of the local max-entropy and free energy principles share a very common structure. Dual
mean energy and temperature constraints may however not lead to a univocal relationship between
Uand β, as is the case for their global counterparts.
Theorem 1. Let β >0 and h∈C0. Under the correspondence p= ρβ(ζv), problem 1 is equivalent
to ﬁnding consistent conservative potentials v∈[h] ∩Fixβ.
Theorem 2. Let U∈ R and h∈C0. Under the correspondence p= ρ1(ζ¯v), problem 2 is equivalent
to ﬁnding consistent conservative potentials ¯v∈[βh] ∩Fix1 for some β >0 and such that ⟨p,h⟩= U.
Let c: C0 →C0 denote multiplication by Bethe-Kikuchi coeﬃcients. This operation may not be
invertible in general, as cb may vanish on some b ∈K. In fact, one knows that cb = 0 whenever b is
not an intersection of maximal regions a 1,..., an ∈K, although assuming that K is the ∩-closure of
a set of maximal regions does not always imply invertibility of c.
4
Deﬁnition 4. Let us call Fixβ
+ = {v+ b|v∈Fixβ,b ∈Ker(cζ)}⊆ C0 the weakly consistent manifold.
In particular, Fixβ
+ = Fixβ when c is invertible.
Theorem 3. Given β >0 and h ∈C0, problem 3 is equivalent to ﬁnding weakly consistent conser-
vative potentials w ∈[h] ∩Fixβ
+ and they can be univocally mapped onto [h] ∩Fixβ by a retraction
rβ : Fixβ
+ →Fixβ.
The retraction rβ will be deﬁned by equation 16 in the proof below, it maps solutions of problem
3 onto those of 1. We now proceed to prove theorems 2 and 3. We shall discuss their relationship
afterwards. The following combinatorial lemma is essential to the proofs and rather subtle in spite of
its apparent simplicity (see [9, chap 4] for detailed formulas).
Lemma 1. There exists a linear ﬂux map Ψ : C0 →C1 such that c−µ= δΨ.
Proof of lemma 1. One can completely characterise homology classes [ h] = h+ δC1 by the global
energy conservation constraint ∑
a ha = HΩ when K ⊆P(Ω) is closed under intersection [9, cor 2.14].
Therefore equation 6 implies that h = µH and cH are homologous, i.e. ( c−µ)(H) ∈δC1 and one
can construct Ψ : C0 →C1 such that (c−µ)(H) = δΨ(H).
Proof of theorem 1. Very similar to that of 2 below, the precise proof can be found in [9, thm 4.22].
Proof of theorem 2. Given U ∈R and h ∈C0, let p ∈Γ0 such that ⟨p,h⟩= U be a solution of 2.
Deﬁne local energies ¯V = ζ¯v ∈C0 by letting ¯Vb = −ln pb for all b so that p= ρ1( ¯V) = ρ1(ζ¯v). The
consistency of ptherefore implies ¯v∈Fix1. This holds for any other potential ¯v′∈¯v+RK, as addition
of local energy constants preserves Gibbs states.
Let us now show that the energy constraint⟨p,h⟩= Uand the consistency constraintsdp= 0 imply
¯v ∈[βh] for some β. By duality, recalling that δ = d∗ we know that ⟨q,u⟩= 0 for all q ∈Ker(d) is
equivalent to u∈Im(δ). The consistency constraint hence introduces Lagrange multipliers δϕ∈δC1.
The linear constraints ⟨pa,1a⟩= 1 and ⟨p,h⟩= Urespectively introduce Lagrange multipliers terms
of the form λ+ βh ∈RK + Rh.
A classical computation yields the diﬀerential of local entropies Sb∗(pb) = −⟨·,1b + ln(pb)⟩, which
coincides with ⟨·,¯Vb⟩on tangent ﬁbers of Prob( Eb) due to the normalisation constraint. Therefore p
is critical if and only if:
ˇS∗(p)a = ca( ¯Va −1a) = λa1a + βha + δϕa (13)
By lemma 1 we know that c¯V and ¯v = µ¯V are homologous, i.e. ¯v = c¯V −δΨ(c¯V). Therefore 13 is
equivalent to ¯v∈λ+ βh+ δC1. Up to a boundary term of δC1, the local constants λ∈RK could also
be absorbed into a single constant λ′ ∈R. Enforcing the constraint ⟨p,¯v′⟩= βUon the equivalent
potentials ¯v′∈¯v+ RK, one may furthermore ensure that λ′= 0 so that ¯v′∈[βh] ∩Fix1.
Proof of theorem 3. Given H = ζh ∈C0 and β >0, let V = ζv ∈C0 be a solution of 3. The energy
constraint on v∈h+ δC1 implies ˇFβ
∗(V)|Im(ζδ) = 0 with the diﬀerential ˇFβ
∗ : C0 →C∗
0 given by:
ˇFβ
∗(V)a = ca ρβ(Va) (14)
For any subspace B ⊆C0, let us write B⊥⊆C∗
0 for the orthogonal dual (or annihilator) of B. Letting
p = ρβ(V) criticality is then equivalent to Fβ
∗(V) = cp ∈Im(ζδ)⊥. Recall that d = δ∗ by deﬁnition
and denote by ζ∗: q↦→q◦ζ the adjoint of ζ:
cp∈Im(ζδ)⊥ ⇔ ζ∗(cp) ∈Im(δ)⊥ ⇔ ζ∗(cp) ∈Ker(d) (15)
Therefore V is critical for ˇFβ
|Im(ζδ) if and only if ζ∗(cp) = ζ∗(cρβ(V)) is consistent.

Figure 1: Energy-temperature relationships on a graph with two loops. The initial potential βh
(solid line) reaches (a) a cuspidal singularity and (b) a generic singularity at β = 1. Dashed lines
correspond to mean energies of stable equilibria obtained from homologous initial conditions βh+ δϕ.
Note that β <0 should be understood as a reversal of interactions, the limit β →±0 being equivalent
to T →∞.
Assume p∈Ker(d) is consistent. Then by the dual form of lemma 1 involving ( δΨ)∗= Ψ∗dwhich
vanishes on Ker( d), we have cp = µ∗p and ζ∗(cp) = p is consistent as well. This shows that any
consistent potential v∈[h] ∩Fixβ yields a critical point V = ζv of the Bethe-Kikuchi energy ˇFβ(V).
Reciprocally assume q = ζ∗(cp) ∈Ker(d), then µ∗(q) = cq by lemma 1 and cq = cp, which means
that pb and qb coincide on any b ∈K such that cb ̸= 0. Let us deﬁne energies W = ζw ∈C0 by:
Wb = −1
β ln(qb) + Fβ
b (Vb) (16)
Observing that q = ρβ(W) and Fβ
b (Wb) = Fβ
b (Vb) for all b, one sees that cp= cq implies cV = cW.
By lemma 1 we get µV ∈µW+δC1 so that the potentials w= µW satisfy the global energy constraint
[w] = [v] = [h]. By the assumption q∈Ker(d) this shows that w∈[h] ∩Fixβ. The relation cV = cW
implies v−w= µ(V −W) ∈Ker(cζ), so that v∈[h]∩Fixβ
+ is weakly consistent by deﬁnition of Fixβ
+.
The retraction rβ : Fixβ
+ →Fixβ is described more succinctly via its conjugate Rβ = ζ ◦rβ ◦µ
acting on local energies V = ζv ∈C0:

which amounts to applying the linear projection ζ∗c on beliefs before chosing energies as 16.
4 Conclusion
Letting ¯v = βv, note that solutions of 2 can be written p = ρβ(ζv) with v ∈[h] ∩Fixβ solution
of 1, as ¯v ∈[βh] ∩Fix1 is equivalent to v ∈[h] ∩Fixβ. The form of theorem 2 involves a simpler
intersection problem in C0, between the linear subspace (βh)β∈R +δC1, a non-linear energy constraint
⟨ρ1(ζ¯v),h⟩= U, and the consistent manifold Fix1 that does not depend on β. The possible multiplicity
6
of solutions for a given energy constraint Umay however occur for diﬀerent values of the Lagrange
multiplier β.
In the high temperature limit β →0, one can show that [ h] is transverse to Fix β [9, prop 5.11],
or equivalently that Im( δ) ∩T0Fix = {0}, so that a univocal energy-temperature relationship βh(U)
can be deﬁned in a neighbourhood V0 of h = 0. In this quasi-linear regime, all three problems are
therefore equivalent to ﬁnding the intersection [ h] ∩Fixβh(U) restricted to V0.
Let us say that ¯v∈[βh] ∩Fix1 is singular if TvFix1 ∩δC1 ̸= 0, which may occur for some β = βc.
A generic singular point, although consistent, is not stable (cuspidal singularities are one exception).
The diﬀusion ﬂow will therefore generically depart from a singular potential, one should then expect a
sharp drop in internal energy for β >βc as ﬁgure 1 illustrates empirically on a graph with two loops.
In general, one may deﬁne an energy spectrum ¯Uh(β) : R∗
+ →Pﬁn(R) as the image of [h] ∩Fixβ under
v↦→⟨ρβ(ζv),h⟩to account for the multiplicity of equilibria. Figure 1, obtained in the Ising model on a
graph with two loops, illustrates a case where ¯Uh(0) and [0] ∩Fix are degenerate of cardinal ≥3. The
singular space can be parameterised by polynomial equations on p= ρ(ζh) ∈Γ0 which can be solved
exactly in simple examples [9, chap 6]. They compute the determinant of the linearised diﬀusion ﬂow
restricted to δC1.
