Abstract
In this commentary, we respond to a technical analysis of the Free Energy Principle
(hereafter: FEP) presented in "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Prin-
ciple" by Aguilera et al. In the target article, the authors analyzed certain sparsely
coupled stochastic diﬀerential equations whose non-equilibrium steady-state densities
are claimed—in previous FEP literature—to have a Markov blanket. The authors
demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse
coupling. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling
and Markov blankets in the case of Gaussian steady-state densities. We precisely derive
conditions under which causal coupling leads—or does not lead—to Markov blankets.
Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic diﬀeren-
tial equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to
have Markov blankets. Future work should focus on verifying whether these sorts of
constraints are satisﬁed in realistic models of sparsely coupled systems.

entail conditional independence between states (i.e. Markov blankets [2]) in the steady state
distribution. The authors used these considerations to explore the limits and applicability
of the Free Energy Principle (hereafter: FEP) in linear stochastic sytems. Previous FEP
literature has intimated that sparse coupling structures (absent causal coupling between two
subsets of states) lead to the emergence of Markov blankets [3]. Further developments ex-
panded on this statement to require additional sparsity constraints on the functional form
of the ﬂow [4, 5].
The authors analyzed the ‘canonical loop’ that is claimed to generically give rise to
Markov blankets in [3]. The authors show that in general Markov blankets are not guaran-
teed, and that ‘such a cyclic structure can generate couplings that propagate beyond causal
interactions’. Although the exact relationship between sparse coupling and conditional inde-
pendence was not rigorously deﬁned in [3], subsequent work has constrained the implication
of sparse coupling to conditional independence by invoking particular restrictions on the
nature of the solenoidal coupling that connects diﬀerent variables to one another [4–6]. The
current commentary in many ways serves as a supplementary set of derivations that expands
upon and explains mathematical relationships that have previously been shown.
Inthiscommentarywepreciselyderivetheconditionsunderwhichcausalcouplingleads—
or does not lead—to conditional independence. Importantly, our derivations hold for both
the linear case (the same class of systems investigated by the target article) as well as in the
general, nonlinear case [4, 7]. We show how conditional independence (Markov blankets) and
causal coupling have a well-deﬁned relationship that depends on the form of the solenoidal
ﬂow operator, which underlies the breaking of detailed balance [2, 8, 9].
We show that the relationship between sparse coupling and conditional independence is
particularly strengthened when one assumes the state-dependence of the solenoidal ﬂow (a
crucial feature underlying stochastic chaos and itinerancy in random dynamical systems [2,
4]) has a ‘locality’ constraint, whereby the coupling between any two pairs of states does not
depend on other states besides the two that are interacting. This mathematical result may
shed light on the sorts of systems we expect Markov blankets to emerge from sparse coupling.
The ‘locality-of-coupling’ constraint may particularly apply to the case of spatially-localized
interactions (e.g. neighbouring particles or individuals interacting in a collective). The
simple geometry of spatially-distributed systems characterized by short-range interactions
may tend to enforce the locality conditions of solenoidal state-dependence and thus generally
ensure that sparse coupling gives rise to Markov blankets. Future work, building along the
lines of [4], should focus on verifying whether these sorts of locality constraints on solenoidal
dependence are satisﬁed in realistic models of locally-interacting systems.
2 Sparse coupling in stochastic systems
Most treatments of the FEP [3, 5, 7, 10] start by considering the evolution of a system
deﬁned over some state-spacex, whose trajectories can be described using a Langevin-style
2
(Itô) stochastic diﬀerential equation:
˙xt = f(xt) + ω (1)
where ˙x represents a partial temporal derivative andω is additive Wiener noise.
We assume that the solution admits a (non-equilibrium) steady-state densityp, i.e., a
solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation [11]
0 = ∇·(Γ∇p(x) −f(x)p(x)), (2)
whereΓ = E[ωω⊤]/2 is the diﬀusion tensor, expressing the covariance of random ﬂuctuations.
Thus, we can express the ﬂowf of the stochastic diﬀerential equation as a sum of dissipative
(curl-free) and conservative (divergence-free) terms, using a Helmholtz decomposition [2,
Appendix B]1:
f(x) = Γ(x)∇log p(x) + ∇·Γ(x)  
dissipative
−Q(x)∇log p(x) −∇· Q(x)  
conservative
(3)
Here and throughout,∇· Q denotes the divergence of the matrix ﬁeld deﬁned as(∇·
Q)i = ∑
j
∂
∂xj
Qij.2 In the FEP literature, we often re-write the ﬂow decomposition off(x)
succinctly using the gradients of the negative log stationary density or surprisalI(x) =
−log p(x):
f(x) = Ω(x)∇I(x) −Λ(x)
where Ω(x) ≜ Q(x) −Γ(x), Λ(x) ≜ ∇·Ω(x). (4)
To ease notation, we will omit writing the dependency on x of Q and Ω in subse-
quent derivations, noting that this does not imply they are assumed to be constant, state-
independent functions. However, we will assume constant, diagonalΓ throughout. Imposing
a constant, diagonal Γ is the equivalent of forcing random ﬂuctuationsω perturbing the
system to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
Using this expression for the ﬂow, we can then write the Jacobian of the systemJ where
Juv = ∂fu
∂xv
as follows:
J = ΩH + ∇Ω∇I −∇Λ. (5)
The HessianH is a matrix whose entries encode the double partial derivatives (or ‘cur-
vature’) of the surprisal, with respect to the states:Huv = ∂2I(x)
∂xu∂xv
. In the case of a Gaussian
1See [2, 9, Appendix B] for a thermodynamic interpretation of these ﬂows and [12] for a geometric
interpretation.
2In other ﬁelds the same notation is used to denote the transpose of our deﬁnition [13, 14], which amounts
to a change of sign when the matrix ﬁeld is antisymmetric.

steady-state (i.e., a quadratic surprisal, whereI(x) is a second-order polynomial), then a
zero-entry inH implies conditional independence and vice-versa [2, 4]:
H(x)uv = ∂2I
∂xv∂xu
= 0
⇔I (xu |b,xv) = I (xu|b)
⇔I (xu,xv|b) = I (xu|b) + I (xv|b)
⇔(xu ⊥xv) |b: b= x˜u,˜v (6)
where the tilde notation˜udenotes the complement of a set of statesu. We can then use
the matrix form of the Jacobian (5) to determine how the ﬂow of one variablexu depends
on the state of anotherxv:
Juv = ∂fu
∂xv

. (7)
When we assume a particular partition of the state-spacexinto internal, active, sensory,
and external states, respectively x = ( µ,a,s,η ), and further deﬁning autonomous α =
(µ,a) and non-autonomous states β = ( s,η) = ˜α, we can then investigate the conditions
under which sparse coupling is suﬃcient for conditional independence between variables, i.e.,
Markov blankets in the stationary densityp.
One sort of coupling structure that can be related to conditional independence (under
extra constraints on the ﬂow operator), is the so-called ‘canonical loop’ described in the
targetarticle[1, Figure4A], whichwasintroducedinearlierliterature[3, 4, 6]. Thisstructure
assumes that sensory paths do not depend on internal paths, and active paths do not depend
on external paths [7]. This is best expressed in terms of the Jacobian:
J =


Jηη Jηs Jηa
Jsη Jss Jsa
Jas Jaa Jaµ
Jµs Jµa Jµµ

 (8)
Given this sparse coupling structure and our expression for the Jacobian in terms of the
Hessian in Equations (5) and (7), one can then ask: what kinds of constraints must be in
place on the ﬂow operatorΩ in order for sparse coupling to imply conditional independence?
By setting the left-hand side of Equation (7) to0, we can determine the conditions under
which an absence of coupling from statev to stateu, implies a corresponding0 in the entry
of the HessianHuv.
The case of absent coupling
Tostayconsistentwiththetargetarticle’sfocusonlinearLangevinequations, weﬁrstassume
that Ω and H are constant in the states. Thus Equation (5) reduces to:
J = ΩH (9)
4
The usual correction terms∇Ω∇J and∇Λ disappear in the linear case because∇xΩ = 0.
We can expand the expressions forJηµ and Jµη to see what terms ofΩ and H they depend
on:
Jηµ = (Qηη −Γη)Hηµ +
∑
i∈˜η
QηiHiµ
Jµη = (Qµµ −Γµ)H⊤
ηµ +
∑
i∈˜µ
QµiHiη
(10)
Absent coupling in one direction or another enable us to derive speciﬁc expressions for
the Hessian
Jηµ = 0 ⇐⇒Hηµ = (Γη −Qηη)−1
∑
i∈˜η
QηiHiµ (11)
Jµη = 0 ⇐⇒ −Hηµ(Qµµ + Γµ) −
∑
i∈˜µ
HηiQiµ = 0
⇐⇒Hηµ = −(Qµµ + Γµ)−1
∑
i∈˜µ
HηiQiµ (12)
Thus, we can completely characterise conditional independence under the absence of
couplings in both directions:
Assuming Jηµ = 0 : Hηµ = 0 ⇐⇒
∑
i∈˜η
QηiHiµ = 0
Assuming Jµη = 0 : Hηµ = 0 ⇐⇒
∑
i∈˜µ
HηiQiµ = 0
(13)
These expressions simplify when we assume the so-called ‘normal’ or ‘canonical’ form
of the ﬂow [4–7], in which the Jacobian is sparse because solenoidal couplings between
autonomous (α= (µ,a)) and non-autonomous (β = (η,s)) states are assumed to be absent:


Jηη Jηs Jηa
Jsη Jss Jsa
Jas Jaa Jaµ
Jµs Jµa Jµµ



(14)
Note that the ‘block-solenoidal’ termsQηη and Qµµ are 0 if each state-subset is univariate
(e.g. µ,η are both one-dimensional).
Assuming the canonical form of the ﬂow (14), certain terms in (13) vanish and the
conditional independence condition is simpliﬁed
Assuming (14): Hηµ = 0 ⇐⇒QηsHsµ = 0 ⇐⇒HηaQaµ = 0. (15)
5
For example, if we assume absent oﬀ-diagonal solenoidal ﬂow, then Markov blankets are
guaranteed from sparse coupling.
An open question, which the authors of the target article touched on in their analytic
expressions for the drift matrices (or Jacobians) of linear systems, is whether linear systems
that satisfy conditional independence under sparse coupling are ‘rare’ or not. The classiﬁca-
tion of a particular linear system as ‘rare’ depends on an underlying assumption about the
distribution of (sparse) drift matrices from which we expect such diﬀusions to be generated.
In particular, if we assume that both statistical and solenoidal coupling in real systems is
local, then both Q and H will become sparser as dimension increases, and the entries of
the inner products in (15) will vanish with high probability. This can be easily shown by
observing that the probability of sparse vectors being orthogonal (their inner-product van-
ishing) asymptotically approaches1.0 as dimension increases. Whether it is fair to assume
locality (and thus sparsity) in theQ and H operators, depends on prior assumptions about
the nature of solenoidal coupling and covariance relationships that characterize real systems
with Gaussian steady state [15, 16]. For example, we may expect solenoidal operatorsQ to
be sparse for complex systems deﬁned by localized (and thus sparse) interactions across a
network of spatially-segregated components.
In the more general non-linear case where∇xΩ(x) ̸= 0, additional terms (corresponding
to the summands of the correction termΛ(x)) appear in (10) and propagate into (13) and
(15).
The sparse coupling conjecture
We now examine the conditions under which one can impute conditional independence from
not only absent coupling Juv = Jvu = 0 , but also from unidirectional or non-reciprocal
coupling, i.e., Juv = 0,Jvu ̸= 0. The so-called sparse coupling conjecture[4, 7] conjectures
the following implication in a generic class of systems:
JuvJvu = 0 =⇒ Huv = Huv = 0. (16)
Expanding the case ofJηa ̸= 0,Jaη = 0 from (14), we can see why this implies conditional
independence between η and a. If assume there is a Markov blanket between internal and
external states (i.e. the constraints in (15) hold) then we can simplify the expressions for
the coupling betweenη and a:
Assuming Hηµ = 0 : Jηa = (Qηη −Γη)Hηa +
∑
i∈˜η
QηiHia
= (Qηη −Γη) Hηa + QηsHsa
Jaη = (Qaa −Γa)H⊤
aη +
∑
i∈˜a
QaiHiη = 0
= (Qaa −Γa) H⊤
aη (17)
The only way forJaη to vanish whileH⊤
aη = Hηa is non-zero, is forQaaH⊤
aη = ΓaH⊤
aη,
which cannot hold because these terms are by deﬁnition orthogonal to another and can only
6
be equal if they both vanish, which is impossible due to the the positive-deﬁniteness ofΓa
and H. Therefore H⊤
aη = Hηa = 0 and the sparse coupling conjecture is veriﬁed for the
normal form laid out in Equation (14). Similar reasoning can be used to expand the entries
for Jsµ and Jµs to re-write the normal form with a fully-sparse Hessian and Jacobian:


Jηη Jηs Jηa
Jsη Jss Jsa
Jas Jaa Jaµ
Jµs Jµa Jµµ

(18)
Now, for generality, we reﬁne these conditions for the fully nonlinear case, assuming for
simplicity that the only component of the ﬂow operator that is state-dependent isQ (Γ is
state-independent and diagonal, as before):

. (21)
We can now derive explicit conditions on the nature of the solenoidal ﬂow’s state depen-
dence that guarantee, barring edge cases, an implication of conditional independence from
sparse coupling. We once again assume a Markov blanket betweenηand µ, i.e. the nonlinear
equivalent of (15) is satisﬁed.
Taking coupling between internal and sensory states as an example, the sparse coupling
in Equation (20) assumes Jsµ = 0 . We can expand its expression in the Jacobian, now
including the gradients and curvatures of the solenoidal ﬂow:
Jsµ = (Qss −Γss) Hsµ + ∇µQsη ·∇ηI(x) + ∇µQss ·∇sI(x) −∇2
sµQss −∇2
ηµQηs. (22)
The ﬁnal two terms∇2
sµQss and ∇2
ηµQsη vanish under the assumption that the solenoidal
ﬂow depends at most linearly on ‘non-local’ terms.3 If we restrict this ﬂow further, such
3By ‘non-local’ dependence we mean if the solenoidal couplingQuv between two statesu and v depends
on some third statey, i.e. ∂yQuv ̸= 0.
7
that Qsη only depends onsand η, then all the partial derivatives of the solenoidal ﬂow with
respect to other states (here,µ) vanish, meaning the expression for the Jacobian reduces to:
Jsµ = (Qss −Γss) Hsµ. (23)
Therefore Jsµ will be 0 if and only ifsand µare conditionally independent, i.e.,Hsµ = 0.
If we however allow the solenoidal ﬂow to have ‘non-local’ state-dependence, then the
presence of the remaining partial derivatives in (22) could render the normal form a counter-
example to the sparse coupling conjecture, unless the extra terms all cancel. This means
that even in the case of conditional independence betweens and µ, the coupling betweens
and µcould be non-zero, if the solenoidal ﬂow depends on more states than only those that
it ‘connects.’ This has interesting implications for the constraints we might expect in natural
systems, where the interactions mediated by solenoidal ﬂow should be ‘locally-dependent’
(only depend on the states that are interacting) if Markov blankets are to be implied by
sparse coupling. This may be a natural tendency in the case of spatially-extensive systems
(e.g. cells, neurons, collectives of individuals) where localized interactions may be expected
to only depend on states that are participating in the interaction.
Assuming edge-cases are not satisﬁed, we can now re-write Equation (20) with the ﬂow
respecting the assumption of local state-dependence, and the Hessian expressing more strin-
gent conditional independence relationships:



where the state-dependent ﬂow operatorΩ = Q−Γ, as before, lacks coupling between
autonomous and non-autonomous states as in Equation (20).
3 Concluding remarks
We hope the derivations provided here in addition to those in the target article contribute to
an improved understanding of the relationship between dynamical and statistical dependence
in Langevin equations with a steady-state.
Our derivations suggest that the lack of coupling between two states only implies con-
ditional independence in certain cases, as speciﬁed in Equation (15). In that sense, we ﬁnd
general agreement with the target article that in general, causal coupling does not have a
straightforward relationship to conditional independence or the presence of Markov blankets.
8
However, we note that in the limit of increasing dimensionality and sparseQ and H, then
Markov blankets are likely to be implied by sparse coupling, speciﬁcally because the inner
products in (13) are expected to vanish, by virtue of being equivalent to the dot products
(or sums thereof) of sparse vectors. We also show (in agreement with statements made in [4,
7]) that evenunidirectional couplingcan imply conditional independence, but further con-
straints on the ﬂow operator and the nature of its state-dependence are required in order for
this to hold true. Interestingly, the functional form of the state-dependence of the solenoidal
ﬂow, that is required in order to sustain conditional independence from sparse coupling, may
agree with the sorts of ‘locality constraints’ we would expect in natural systems, where any
nonlinear coupling between interacting states should only depend on the states participating
in the interaction. This result may provide a formal basis for the ‘local’ nature of interactions
in spatially-extended, self-organizing systems, whose state-space can often be decomposed
into causally-coupled sub-systems.
We conclude by celebrating the words of the authors of the target article, on how these
sorts of investigations oﬀer an opportunity to study in detail "the connection between non-
trivial dynamics and the statistical properties of coupled systems" [1].
