Abstract. - It is shown that the Shan-Chen (SC) model for non-ideal lattice fluidscan be made
compliantwithapseudofree-energyprinciplebysimpleadditionofagradientforce,whoseexpres-
sion is uniquelyspecified in termsof thefluiddensity. This additional term isnumerically shown
toprovidefairlynegligibleeffectsonthesystemevolutionduringphase-separation. Tothebestof
ourknowledge,theseimportantpropertiesoftheSCmodelwerenotnotedbefore. Theapproach
developed in the present work is based on a continuum analysis: further extensions, more in line
with a discrete lattice theory (X. Shan, Phys Rev E, 77 066702 (2008)) can be envisaged for the
future.
