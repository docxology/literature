Abstract. - It is shown that the Shan-Chen (SC) model for non-ideal latt ice ﬂuids can be made
compliant with a pseudo free-energy principle by simple add ition of a gradient force, whose expres-
sion is uniquely speciﬁed in terms of the ﬂuid density. This a dditional term is numerically shown
to provide fairly negligible eﬀects on the system evolution during phase-separation. To the best of
our knowledge, these important properties of the SC model we re not noted before. The approach
developed in the present work is based on a continuum analysi s: further extensions, more in line
with a discrete lattice theory (X. Shan, Phys Rev E , 77 066702 (2008)) can be envisaged for the
future.
Multiphase ﬂuid ﬂows are ubiquitous in nature, sci-
ence and technology [1, 2]. Owing to the complexity of
the underlying physics, often leading to the formation of
complex space-time changing interfaces between the vari-
ous phases/components, analytical methods have a limited
range of applicability for the quantitative study of multi-
phase ﬂows. Consequently, ﬂexible and eﬃcient methods
for the numerical simulation of multiphase ﬂows are in
constant demand. In the last decade, a new class of meth-
ods, based on a suitably discretized version of the Boltz-
mann kinetic equation, i.e. the lattice Boltzmann (LB)
models [3–5] have been developed [6–14].
The main appeal of the lattice kinetic approach is the
simplicity of its underlying dynamics, which consists of
a free-streaming of a set pseudo-particles along a set of
prescribed directions (discrete speeds), followed by a col-
lisional relaxation around local equilibria. Crucial to the
extension of the LB scheme to non-ideal ﬂuids, is the possi-
bility of encoding potential energy interactions at the level
of a simple forcing term, acting upon the discrete Boltz-
mann distributions. Suitable choices of this forcing term
have proven capable of triggering a fairly rich non-ideal
ﬂuid behaviour, such as phase-transitions and interface
formation/propagation [6, 15, 16], with no need of track-
ing the shape of the interface, but rather having it emerge
from the underlying mesoscopic interactions.
A widely used lattice Boltzmann algorithm [3] with in-
terparticle interactions is the pseudo-potential scheme due
to Shan-Chen (hereafter SC) model [6, 7]. The evolution
over a unit time lapse reads as follows:
fl(x + cl,t + 1) − fl(x,t ) = − 1
τ
(
fl(x,t ) − f(eq)
l (ρ, u′)
)
(1)
where fl(x,t ) is the kinetic probability density function
associated with the particle velocity cl, τis the mean colli-
sion time, f(eq)
l (ρ, u) the local equilibrium, corresponding
to a Maxwellian distribution with local density ρand local
ﬂuid speed u. Finally, ρu′ = ρu + τF where F represents
a general forcing term encoding inter-molecular interac-
tions. To be noted that this force enters the scheme in the
form of a shift, u′ − u ≡ F τ/ρ , of the local ﬂow speed.
In the original SC model [6, 7], the bulk interparticle in-
teraction is proportional to a free parameter (the ratio of
potential to thermal energy), G, entering the equation for
the momentum balance:
FSC
i (x) = Gψ(x)
∑
l
wl(|cl|2)ψ(x + cl)ci
l. (2)
where wl(|cl|2) are static weights normalized to unity [23],
and ψ(x,t ) = ψ(ρ(x,t )) is the (pseudo) potential de-
scribing the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interactions triggered by inhomo-
geneities of the density proﬁle.

M. Sbragaglia et al.
This pseudo-potential may also be viewed as a gener-
alized density , obeying the general properties of going to
zero in the limit ρ → 0, and saturating to a constant
value at large densities. The mapping ρ → ψ(ρ) may
be heuristically interpreted as the result of a resumma-
tion of many-body collisions at all orders. On practical
grounds, its main eﬀect is to set the intermolecular forces
to zero at high density, a property which we may pic-
torially call ’asymptotic freedom’, since it indicates that
at high-density/short-distances, particles are set free from
mutual interactions. This property is crucial to prevent
density collapse due to attractive interactions, and surro-
gates the eﬀect of hard-core repulsion, which would other-
wise jeopardize the numerical stability of the scheme. In
fact, the replacement of physical density with a general-
ized is probably to be regarded as a general constraint of
lattice models of non-ideal hydrodynamics.
The presence of the pseudo-potential turns the bulk
ideal equation of state Pb(ρ) = ρT (with T the local tem-
perature ) into a non-ideal one, Pb(ρ) = ρT − G
2 ψ2. It
is readily seen that a suﬃciently large value of the cou-
pling parameter G leads to a Van der Waals-like loop,
corresponding to the formation of a stable liquid-gas in-
terface (phase-separation) [6, 7]. The above concerns the
behaviour of the bulk ﬂow, suﬃciently away from the in-
terface. In order to discuss interface physics, one needs
to inspect the contribution of the interactions to the non-
ideal pressure tensor, deﬁned by the relation:
− ∂jPij = FSC
i − ∂i(ρT). (3)
The properties of this tensor have been investigated in a
number of recent publications [17, 18]. It should be noted
that a direct transcription of the force balance on a lattice
with a ﬁnite set of velocities leads to a discrete form of
the pressure tensor [18] that diﬀers slightly from the con-
tinuum deﬁnition (3). However, by suitably enlarging the
set of discrete velocities [17], Pij is well approximated 1
by its continuum limit
Pij =
[
Pb(ρ) − G
4 |∇ψ|2 − G
2 ψ∆ ψ
]
δij + G
2 ∂iψ∂jψ. (4)
that satisﬁes (4) upon Taylor expansion of the forcing
(2). In the sequel, we shall refer to this expression of the
pressure tensor, leaving the discussion on the discrete
lattice eﬀects to a future work.
At variance with other LB formulations for non-ideal
ﬂuids, the SC was not derived from a free-energy func-
tional, which has often been pointed out as a theoretical
liability of the model.
Yet, in view of its practical success, it is tempting to
argue that there might be an ’hidden’ pseudo-free energy
(PFE) behind it. In this work, we shall show that the no-
tion of generalized density can indeed be derived from a
1Technically speaking, this limit corresponds to the casee4 >> 1
in equations (22a) and (22b) andǫ ≈ 1 in equation (25) of [18].
suitably generalized (pseudo) free-energy functional. This
is a potentially important result in two respects; ﬁrst, it
puts the SC method on a solid foundational basis within
the general framework of non-equilibrium statistical me-
chanics. Second, it opens new perspectives for the for-
mulation of a thermo-hydrodynamical lattice formulation
of non-ideal ﬂuids. A very convenient aspect of the SC
model over direct free-energy formulations [8] is that local
equilibria keep a Maxwellian shape, only shifted by the
amount F τ/ρ . This oﬀers better control on its numerical
stability, and also a direct link with self-consistent thermal
equilibria [19].
The former property is key for lattice implementations,
since it permits to preserve the same ”stream-collide”
structure of LB schemes for ideal gases, the eﬀects of
non-ideal interactions being entirely incorporated within
the self-consistent velocity shift. It is worth reminding
that the stream-collide structure is essential to the eﬃ-
ciency/accuracy of the method, since the lattice streaming
operator (lhs of equation (1)) is exact, and collisions are
conservative up to machine round-oﬀ.
Free-Energy derivation. – We begin by consider-
ing a free-energy functional in the standard weak-gradient
approximation [1]:
L(ρ, ∇ρ) = f(ρ) + κ
2 |∇ρ|2 (5)
where the bulk free energy f(ρ) is connected to the bulk
pressure via the familiar equilibrium Legendre’s trans-
form:
Pb(ρ) = ρdf
dρ − f(ρ). (6)
The term κ
2 |∇ρ|2 describes the energy surplus required
to build up and maintain the interface, and is clearly re-
lated to surface tension [1]. Despite its manifest link to
underlying molecular interactions [20], to the best of our
knowledge, no ﬁrst-principle derivation of such relation is
known. As a result, this term leaves us with some degree
of latitude to design a free-energy functional consistent
with the equilibrium states of the SC model.
Since the oﬀ-diagonal terms of the SC pressure tensor
in (4) take the form ≈ ∂iψ∂jψ, it is natural to postulate
the following hybrid (ρ-ψ) form of free-energy functional:
L(ρ, ∇ψ) = f(ρ) + κ
2 |∇ψ|2 = f(ρ) + κ
2
( dψ
dρ
) 2
|∇ρ|2.
It is worth noting that this ’hybrid’ form is equivalent
to the standard one (5), only with a density-dependent
surface coupling, κ = κ(ρ) = κ
(
∂ψ
∂ρ
) 2
. This property has
been recently exploited to produce a number of non-trivial
dynamical eﬀects, such as structural arrest and ageing, in
the framework of binary mixtures [21]. Having introduced
the hybrid free-energy, we next proceed to identify the re-
sulting conserved currents through a standard application
of Noether’s theorem.

Free Energy formulation for a class of multiphase models
Invariance of the free-energy with respect to spatial
translations, leads to the following conserved tensorial cur-
rent [22]
∂jJij = 0 (7)
with
Jij = −Lδij + ∂L
∂(∂iρ)∂jρ. (8)
The next step is to explore the properties of this conserved
current under the constraint of mass conservation and sta-
tionarity of the free energy. To this purpose, we introduce
a Lagrange multiplier, λ, associated with mass conserva-
tion, and re-deﬁne our PFE accordingly:
Lλ(ρ, ∇ψ) = f(ρ) + κ
2
( dψ
dρ
) 2
|∇ρ|2 − λρ. (9)
Minimization of the constrained free-energy leads to the
following Euler-Lagrange equations:
∂Lλ
∂ρ − ∂i
( ∂Lλ
∂(∂iρ)
)
− λ = 0 (10)
from which, the value of λ is obtained:
λ = df(ρ)
dρ − κdψ
dρ∆ ψ. (11)
With this value of λ and the use of relation (6), the con-
served current, hereafter to be identiﬁed with the free-
energy consistent pressure tensor, PFE
ij , becomes
Jλ
ij ≡ PFE
ij =
[
Pb(ρ) − κ
2 |∇ψ|2 − κρdψ
dρ∆ ψ
]
δij+κ∂iψ∂jψ
(12)
where we observe that, as anticipated, in order to re-
produce the oﬀ-diagonal term κ∂iψ∂jψ, a contribution
κ
2 |∇ψ|2 in the free energy is actually required. This im-
mediately ﬁxes κ = G
2 .
Connection to Shan-Chen Model. – The above
derivation bears close links to the pressure tensor associ-
ated with the SC forcing, in its simplest instance:
FSC
i (x) = Gψ(x)
∑
l
wl(|cl|2)ψ(x + cl)ci
l.
In particular, on the assumption of gentle interfaces, hence
neglecting higher order terms, this force (we remind that
in our notation G >0) reads as:
FSC
i = G∂i
ψ2
2 + 1
2Gψ∂i∆ ψ + .... (13)
where we have made use of the usual lattice tensor prop-
erties (see [17] for a detailed description). The ﬁrst term
in (13) is related to the bulk pressure via the relation (3),
Pb(ρ) = ρT − 1
2Gψ2(ρ).
The required function f(ρ) is readily derived from its def-
inition as a Legendre’s transform of the bulk pressure
f(ρ) = ρ
∫ ρ
ρ0
Pb(ξ)
ξ2 dξ
where the constant of integration ρ0 aﬀects the total free
energy through an additive constant, with no eﬀect on
the time derivative, because mass is assumed to be con-
served. The surface term 1
2 Gψ∂i∆ ψ has to be handled
with care. The forcing term associated with the consis-
tent free-energy pressure tensor in the continuum, reads
(after setting κ = G/ 2 in (4)) as follows:
PFE
ij =
[
Pb(ρ) − G
4 |∇ψ|2 − G
2 ρdψ
dρ∆ ψ
]
δij + G
2 ∂iψ∂jψ.
(14)
This does not match the SC formulation given in (4),
due to the presence of the term G
2 ρdψ
dρ∆ ψ. The reason
is clear: physical mass, associated with ρ, is conserved,
while generalized mass, associated with ψ, is not. This is
why, strictly speaking, the SC model cannot be derived
from a free-energy functional. Nevertheless, the interest-
ing observation is that the only diﬀerence is conﬁned to
the diagonal component of the pressure tensor, while the
oﬀ-diagonal term, G
2 ∂iψ∂jψ, is exactly reproduced. This
is a very welcome property, since it allows to match the
two descriptions by simply adding an ad-hoc correction
in the form of the gradient of a -known- potential. More
precisely, we start from the following relation:
PFE
ij = PSC
ij + P(add)
ij (15)
where we have deﬁned:
P(add)
ij = G
2 [ζ(ρ)∆ ψ] δij. (16)
In the above,
ζ(ρ) = −ρdψ
dρ + ψ (17)
is the Legendre’s transform of the generalized versus
physical density. This term is responsible for the non-
conservation of the generalized mass. Upon diﬀerentiation
of expression (15) and use of (3), we obtain
− ∂jPFE
ij + ∂i(ρ) = FSC
i − ∂iVFE(ρ, ∆ ψ) (18)
where we have deﬁned
VFE(ρ, ∆ ψ) = G
2 [ζ(ρ)∆ ψ] . (19)
Clearly VFE(ρ, ∆ ψ) is the precise free-energy potential
needed to recover a consistent free-energy treatment. In
other words,
FFE
i = FSC
i − ∂iVFE (20)
is the right forcing, stemming from a free-energy consistent
equilibrium. In conclusion, the conﬁguration minimizing

L(ρ, ∇ψ) = f(ρ) + G

(21)
and the static equilibrium associated with the forcing:
FFE
i (x) = Gψ(x)
∑
l
wl(|cl|2)ψ(x + cl)ci
l − ∂iVFE (22)
share the same physics.
Continuum Maxwell Rule. – Next, we proceed to
show that the integral constraints associated with the con-
tinuum free-energy density, lead to the Maxwell equal-area
rule ﬁxing the liquid and gas density ( ρl and ρg), indepen-
dently of the structure of the interface, i.e. independently
on whether the physical or generalized densities are used.
This is again crucial to the practical success of the SC
model. To this end, we begin by minimizing Lλ(ρ, ∇ψ)
in (9) along a ﬂat and stable liquid-gas interface, where
inhomogeneities are conﬁned along the ycoordinate. This
sets the value of λ
λ = df(ρ)
dρ − κdψ
dρ∂yyψ (23)
with the bulk phases at the same chemical potential (be-
cause dψ
dρ∂yyψ = 0 in the bulk)

(24)
Upon multiplying by dρ
dy and integrating between y = 0
(conventionally, the bulk gas phase) and a generic y, at
density ρ(y), we obtain:
df
dy − κdψ
dy
d2ψ
dy2 = λdρ
dy. (25)
Integrating once more along y, and making use of the re-
lation (23), leads to the following identity
Pb(ρ) − Pb(ρg) = κ
2 ρ2 d
dρ
[( dψ
dy
) 2 1

]
. (26)
By calling Pb(ρg) = P0 the constant value we wish to
achieve, we ﬁnally obtain
∫ ρ
ρg
(Pb(ρ) − P0)dρ
ρ2 = κ
2
( dψ
dy
) 2 1
ρ. (27)
Since the rhs is zero in the bulk phase, we ﬁnally conclude
that ∫ ρl
ρg
(Pb(ρ) − P0)dρ
ρ2 = 0 (28)
which is the desired expression of Maxwell’s equal-area
law, q.e.d.
Numerical tests. – In this section, our theoretical
ﬁndings are tested against numerical simulations. For the
sake of simplicity, we shall refer to phase-separation in a
2dsystem at a constant temperature ( T = 1), as explained
in [23].
We also have chosen 2, the pseudo-potential in the form
ψ(ρ) = e− 1
2ρ , which sets the free-energy density to
f(ρ) = ρTlog ρ− G
2 ρψ2 (29)
where the ﬁrst term is the ideal gas contribution, supple-
mented by an interaction term. The value of G has been
chosen equal to G = 4 .3, so as to produce stable interfaces
with densities ρg = 0 .26 (gas phase) and ρl = 1 .03 (liquid
phase) approximately with an interface of the order of ten
grid points.
In ﬁgure 1 we show the time evolution of the total
pseudo-free energy F(t) =
∫
L(ρ, ∇ψ)dxdy, under the
SC dynamics. We have used periodic boundary condi-
tions and an initial state with small random perturbation
around an average density value (see plot ( a) of this ﬁg-
ure). The PFE shows a clear monotonic decrease in time,
indicating that the SC dynamics does indeed support some
minimum principle. This ﬁnding is further corroborated
by a direct comparison of the SC dynamics, as given by
equation (2), against the PFE dynamics, as obtained from
the corrected model (22). The numerical data clear indi-
cate that the lack of the correction term, not only does not
spoil the monotonic decrease of the PFE, but also provides
a quantitative agreement with the correct PFE dynamics.
We conclude that, notwithstanding its conceptual impor-
tance, the term restoring compliance of the SC model with
a continuum free-energy functional, is fairly negligible on
practical grounds. This is the basic reason behind the suc-
cess of the SC model, and one that clearly hinges on the
fact that the departure between physical and generalized
densities, as measured by the ’metric’ ζ(ρ), remains suf-
ﬁciently ”small” all along the evolution. The picture is
further clariﬁed by monitoring the detailed dynamics of
an ’elementary’ coalescence event, i.e. two droplets merg-
ing into a single one (equilibrium state). From the results
reported in ﬁgure 2, the trend to a minimum PFE is again
clearly visible, if only with a much smaller change of the
ratio F(t)/F (0), as compared to the phase-separation test,
which was clearly involving several merging events. In par-
ticular, the ﬁgure reveals that virtually all of the change in
PFE is achieved during the merging event. Again, close
agreement between the SC versus PFE dynamics is ob-
served, indicating that the quantitative match observed
in the phase-separation test applies to each merger event
separately, and is not due to some form of statistical can-
cellation between diﬀerent merging events.
Conclusions and outlook. – Summarizing, we have
presented a number of theoretical ﬁndings on the proper-

ties of the SC model for non-ideal ﬂuids. In particular, we
have shown that the SC model supports a genuine pseudo-
free-energy, monotonically decreasing in time as the ﬂuid
phase-separates. According to the common tenet, the SC
dynamics does not derive from a continuum free-energy
functional; however, we have shown that it can be made
compliant with a free-energy functional, by simply adding
a gradient force, whose expression is uniquely speciﬁed
in terms of the density ﬁeld. Numerical simulations of a
phase-separating ﬂuid, provide a clear indication that the
additional gradient force plays a fairly negligible role on
the evolution of the system. This unveils one of the main
reasons behind the practical success of the SC method;
although it was not derived from a free energy minimiza-
tion principle, the SC dynamics does possess a pseudo-free
energy nonetheless. To the best of our knowledge, these
crucial properties of the SC model were not noticed before.
The list of the good news completed, a few words of cau-
tion are in order. First, we have related the SC dynamics
to a continuum free energy functional. While this is in or-
der as a zero-th approximation, the ’discrete’ limit of this
analysis needs to be inspected very carefully [18]. In par-
ticular, one would like to relate the SC dynamics to a dis-
crete free-energy, i.e. a free-energy functional constructed

directly on the lattice. The inclusion of (lattice) free en-
ergies and, more generally, interaction energies, faces with
the important issue of the existence of a H-theorem for lat-
tice models with non-ideal interactions, as well as with the
correct formulation of lattice thermo-hydrodynamic mod-
els [19]. The investigation of lattice models with non-ideal
interactions and thermal dynamics, represents a major is-
sue for future research in the ﬁeld, with a potential far-
reaching impact for non-equilibrium statistical mechan-
ics [24](ﬂowing systems far from equilibrium).
