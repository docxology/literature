## Summary

The loadings indicate which words (features) are most strongly associated with each 
principal component. Positive loadings indicate words that increase with the component, 
while negative loadings indicate words that decrease.

### Key Insights

- Components with higher explained variance capture more of the overall variation in the corpus.
- Words with large absolute loadings are the most important for that component.
- Components can be interpreted as themes or topics in the literature.
