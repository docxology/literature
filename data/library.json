      "abstract": "Recently the notion of post-Hopf algebra was introduced, with the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra as the fundamental example. A novel property is that any cocommutative post-Hopf algebra gives rise to a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra with a generalized Grossman-Larson product. By twisting the post-Hopf product, we provide a combinatorial antipode formula for the sub-adjacent Hopf algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra. Relating to such a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra, we also obtain a closed inverse formula for the Oudom-Guin isomorphism in the context of post-Lie algebras. Especially as a byproduct, we derive a cancellation-free antipode formula for the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra of ordered trees through a concrete tree-grafting expression.",

The key components of Grinch are its rotate and graft subroutines that efficiently reconfigure the hierarchy as new points arrive, supporting discovery of clusters with complex structure. Grinch is motivated by a new notion of separability for clustering with linkage functions: we prove that when the model is consistent with a ground-truth clustering, Grinch is guaranteed to produce a cluster tree containing the ground-truth, independent of data arrival order. Our empirical results on benchmark and author coreference datasets (with standard and learned linkage functions) show that Grinch is more accurate than other scalable methods, and orders of magnitude faster than hierarchical agglomerative clustering.",

This tree-based interpretation, which has a natural generalization to a k-term nested recursion of this type, only applies to homogeneous recursions, and only solves each recursion for one set of initial conditions determined by the tree. In this paper, we extend the tree-based interpretation to solve a non-homogeneous version of the k-term recursion that includes a constant term. To do so we introduce a tree-grafting methodology that inserts copies of a finite tree into the infinite k-ary tree associated with the solution of the corresponding homogeneous k-term recursion. This technique can also be used to solve the given non-homogeneous recursion with various sets of initial conditions.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the resource- and system-building efforts of an eight-week Johns Hopkins University Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration (SCALE-2009) on Semantically-Informed Machine Translation (SIMT). We describe a new modality/negation (MN) annotation scheme, the creation of a (publicly available) MN lexicon, and two automated MN taggers that we built using the annotation scheme and lexicon. Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation), a target (an action associated with modality or negation) and a holder (an experiencer of modality). We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86% (depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data set.   We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations. Syntactic tags enriched with semantic annotations are assigned to parse trees in the target-language training texts through a process of tree grafting. While the focus of our work is modality and negation, the tree grafting procedure is general and supports other types of semantic information. We exploit this capability by including named entities, produced by a pre-existing tagger, in addition to the MN elements produced by the taggers described in this paper. The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu-English test set. This finding supports the hypothesis that both syntactic and semantic information can improve translation quality.",

      "abstract": "There is a notion of non-commutative Lie algebra called \"Leibniz algebra\", which is characterized by the condition: left bracketing is a derivation. The purpose of this article is to introduce and study a new notion of algebra, called \"associative dialgebra\", which is, to the Leibniz algebras, what associative algebras are to Lie algebras. An associative dialgebra is a vector space equipped with two associative operations satisfying three more conditions. For instance, any differential associative algebra gives rise to a dialgebra.   In this article we construct and study a (co)homology theory for associative dialgebras. The surprizing fact, in the construction of the chain complex, is the appearance of the combinatorics of planar binary trees (grafting and nesting). The principal result about this homology theory is its vanishing on free associative dialgebras.   The Koszul dual (in the sense of Ginzburg and Kapranov) of the operad of associative dialgebras is the operad of \"dendriform algebras\". The dendriform algebras are characterized by two operations satisfying three linear conditions. The sum of these two operations defines a new operation which is associative. The free dendriform algebra can be described in terms of planar binary trees. As a consequence we give an explicitly description of strong homotopy associative dialgebras.   This paper is part of a long-standing project whose ultimate aim is to study periodicity phenomenons in algebraic K-theory, as explained in ``Overview on Leibniz algebras, dialgebras and their homology\".

However, phylogenetics analyses can be challenging: they are computationally expensive and must be performed carefully in order to avoid systematic errors and artifacts. Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER; http://pantherdb.org) is a publicly available, user-focused knowledgebase that stores the results of an extensive phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline that includes computational and manual processes and quality control steps. First, fully reconciled phylogenetic trees (including ancestral protein sequences) are reconstructed for a set of \"reference\" protein sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of organisms across the tree of life. Second, the resulting phylogenetic trees are manually reviewed and annotated with function evolution events: inferred gains and losses of protein function along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Here, we describe in detail the current contents of PANTHER, how those contents are generated, and how they can be used in a variety of applications. The PANTHER knowledgebase can be downloaded or accessed via an extensive API. In addition, PANTHER provides software tools to facilitate the application of the knowledgebase to common protein sequence analysis tasks: exploring an annotated genome by gene function; performing \"enrichment analysis\" of lists of genes; annotating a single sequence or large batch of sequences by homology; and assessing the likelihood that a genetic variant at a particular site in a protein will have deleterious effects.",

      "abstract": "The implementation of breeding methods requires the creation of a large and genetically diverse training population. Large-scale experiments are needed for the rapid acquisition of phenotypic data to explore the correlation between genomic and phenotypic information. Traditional sensing technologies for field surveys and field phenotyping rely on manual sampling and are time consuming and labor intensive. Since availability of personnel trained for phenotyping is a major problem, small UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) equipped with various sensors can simplify the surveying procedure, decrease data collection time, and reduce cost. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic characteristics of sweet orange trees grafted on 25 rootstock cultivars with different influences on plant growth and productivity utilizing a UAV-based high throughput phenotyping system. Data collected by UAV were compared with data collected manually according to standard horticultural procedures. The UAV-based technique was able to detect and count citrus trees with high precision (99.9%) in an orchard of 4931 trees and estimate tree canopy size with a high correlation (R = 0.84) with the manual collected data. No correlation of UAV-based data and manually collected data was observed for yield. The reason for the observed deviation is the influence of different rootstock cultivars on yield efficiency. Despite the low vigor-inducing effect of some rootstocks, they are highly productive, whilst others are high in vigor but produce less fruit. Our study demonstrates the high accuracy of the UAV technique to assess tree size. When using these techniques, it is essential to recognize the limitations imposed by the biological system.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The state of São Paulo (SSP) is the first sweet orange growing region in the world. Yet, the SSP citrus industry has been, and still is, under constant attack from various diseases. In the 1940s, tristeza‐quick decline (T‐QD) was responsible for the death of 9 million trees in SSP. The causal agent was a new virus, citrus tristeza virus (CTV). The virus was efficiently spread by aphid vectors, and killed most of the trees grafted on sour orange rootstock. Control of the disease resided in replacing sour orange by alternative rootstocks giving tolerant combinations with scions such as sweet orange. Because of its drought resistance, Rangpur lime became the favourite alternative rootstock, and, by 1995, 85% of the SSP sweet orange trees were grafted on this rootstock. Therefore, when in 1999, many trees grafted on Rangpur lime started to decline and suddenly died, the spectre of T‐QD seemed to hang over SSP again. By 2003, the total number of dead or affected trees was estimated to be over one million. The new disease, citrus sudden death (CSD), resembles T‐QD in several aspects. The two diseases have almost the same symptoms, they spread in time and space in a manner strikingly similar, and the pathological anatomy of the bark at the bud union is alike. Transmission of the CSD agent by graft‐inoculation has been obtained with budwood inoculum taken not only on CSD‐affected trees (grafted on Rangpur lime), but also on symptomless trees (grafted on Cleopatra mandarin) from the same citrus block. This result shows that symptomless trees on Cleopatra mandarin are tolerant to the CSD agent. Trees on rootstocks such as Sunki mandarin or Swingle citrumelo are also tolerant. Thus, in the CSD‐affected region, control consists in replacing Rangpur lime with compatible rootstocks, or in approach‐grafting compatible rootstock seedlings to the scions of trees on Rangpur lime (inarching). More than 5 million trees have been inarched in this way. A new disease of sweet orange, citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), was observed in 1987 in the Triangulo Mineiro of Minas Gerais State and the northern and north‐eastern parts of SSP. By 2000, the disease affected already 34% of the 200 million sweet orange trees in SSP. By 2005, the percentage had increased to 43%, and CVC was present in all citrus growing regions of Brazil. Electron microscopy showed that xylem‐limited bacteria were present in all symptomatic sweet orange leaves and fruit tissues tested, but not in similar materials from healthy, symptomless trees. Bacteria were consistently cultured from twigs of CVC‐affected sweet orange trees but not from twigs of healthy trees. Serological analyses showed the CVC bacterium to be a strain of Xylella fastidiosa. The disease could be reproduced and Koch's postulates fulfilled, by mechanically inoculating a pure culture of X. fastidiosa isolate 8.1.b into sweet orange seedlings. The genome of a CVC strain of X. fastidiosa was sequenced in SSP in the frame of a project supported by FAPESP and Fundecitrus. X. fastidiosa is the first plant pathogenic bacterium, the genome of which has been sequenced. Until recently, America was free of huanglongbing (HLB), but in March 2004 and August 2005, symptoms of the disease were recognized, respectively in the State of São Paulo (SSP) and in Florida, USA. HLB was known in China since 1870 and in South Africa since 1928. Because of its destructiveness and its rapid spread by efficient psyllid insect‐vectors, HLB is probably the most serious citrus disease. HLB is caused by a phloem sieve tube‐restricted Gram negative bacterium, not yet available in culture. In the 1990s, the bacterium was characterized by molecular techniques as a member of the alpha proteobacteria designated Candidatus Liberibacter africanus for the disease in Africa, and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus for HLB in Asia. In SSP, Ca. L. asiaticus is also present, but most of the trees are infected with a new species, Candidatus Liberibacter americanus. IUBMB Life, 59: 346‐354, 2007",

      "abstract": "Citrus greening (Huanglongbing [HLB]) is one of the most destructive diseases of citrus worldwide. The causal agent of HLB in Florida is thought to be ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’. Understanding of the early events in HLB infection is critical for the development of effective measures to control the disease. In this work, we conducted cytopathological studies by following the development of the disease in citrus trees graft inoculated with ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’-containing material under greenhouse conditions to examine the correlation between ultrastructural changes and symptom production, with the main objective of characterizing the early events of infection. Based on our observations, one of the first degenerative changes induced upon invasion of the pathogen appears to be swelling of middle lamella between cell walls surrounding sieve elements. This anatomical aberration was often observed in samples from newly growing flushes in inoculated sweet orange and grapefruit trees at the early “presymptomatic” stage of HLB infection. Development of symptoms and their progression correlated with an increasing degree of microscopic aberrations. Remarkably, the ability to observe the bacterium in the infected tissue also correlated with the degree of the disease progression. Large numbers of bacterial cells were found in phloem sieve tubes in tissue samples from presymptomatic young flushes. In contrast, we did not observe the bacteria in highly symptomatic leaf samples, suggesting a possibility that, at more advanced stages of the disease, a major proportion of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ is present in a nonviable state. We trust that observations reported here advance our understanding of how ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ causes disease. Furthermore, they may be an important aid in answering a question: when and where within an infected tree the tissue serves as a better inoculum source for acquisition and transmission of the bacterium by its psyllid vector.",

      "abstract": "Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd), a noncachexia variant of Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), Citrus viroid III (CVd-III), and Citrus viroid IV (CVd-IV) were co-inoculated as two-, three-, four-, and five-viroid mixtures to Clementine trees grafted on trifoliate orange to evaluate their effect on symptom expression, tree growth, and fruit yield. Most trees infected with CEVd-containing viroid mixtures developed exocortis scaling symptoms, as did CEVd alone, whereas most trees infected with HSVd- or CVd-IV-containing mixtures developed bark-cracking symptoms. Trees infected with mixtures containing both CEVd and CVd-IV revealed the existence of antagonism between these two viroids in terms of the expected bark-scaling and cracking symptoms. Synergistic interactions also were identified in trees infected with certain viroid combinations that, in spite of lacking CEVd, expressed exocortis-like scaling symptoms. Viroid interactions also affected the expected response of trees in terms of vegetative growth and fruit yield. Trees infected with viroid combinations containing CEVd or CVd-III were smaller and produced less fruit than trees infected with mixtures not containing these viroids. Viroid interactions on scion circumference and cumulative fruit yield, in terms of additivity of their effects, were statistically confirmed using a factorial analysis of variance model with two mean estimation approaches. In single-viroid infections, CEVd, CVd-III, and, to a lesser extent, CBLVd consistently and significantly reduced tree size and fruit yield. Conversely, HSVd and CVd-IV slightly increased fruit yield and reduced scion circumference. Rare and not consistent significant interactions were detected with the five-, four-, and three-viroid combinations. Antagonistic interactions between CEVd and CVd-III or CBLVd and CVd-III were revealed over the years with consistent significance. The antagonistic interaction between CEVd and CVd-IV was highly significant over the years when additional viroids were present; however, this antagonism appeared much later in the case of an exclusive interaction. HSVd and CVd-IV showed a consistent and significant synergistic interaction on yield only when both viroids were exclusively present. These results demonstrate antagonistic or synergistic relationships between citrus viroids depending on the viroid mixtures present in the host.",

      "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) tasks have traditionally been solved using engineered features obtained by heuristic processes. Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters' influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.",

      "abstract": "We investigated hydraulic conductance characteristics and associated dry matter production and distribution of peach trees grafted on different rootstocks growing in the field. A single scion genotype was grown on a low ('K146-43'), an intermediate ('Hiawatha') and a high ('Nemaguard') vigor rootstock. 'K146-43' and 'Hiawatha' rootstocks had 27 and 52% lower mean leaf-specific hydraulic conductances, respectively, than the more vigorous 'Nemaguard' rootstock. Tree growth rates and patterns of biomass distribution varied significantly among rootstocks. Mean dry mass relative growth rates of trees on 'K146-43' and 'Nemaguard' were 66 and 75%, respectively, of the rates of trees on 'Nemaguard', and the scion to rootstock dry mass ratios of trees on 'K146-43' and 'Hiawatha' were 63 and 82%, respectively, of the ratio of trees on 'Nemaguard'. Thus, differences in dry matter distribution between the scion and rootstock, which may be a compensatory response to the differences in leaf specific hydraulic conductance among rootstocks, appeared to be related to differences in growth rates. Correspondingly, there was a positive linear relationship between the scion to rootstock dry mass ratio and the rootstock to scion hydraulic conductance ratio when conductance was normalized for dry mass. This study confirms that rootstock effects on tree water relations and vegetative growth potential result, at least in part, from differences in tree hydraulic conductance associated with specific peach rootstocks.",

      "abstract": "Citrus are natural hosts of five viroid species: Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), Citrus viroid III (CVd-III), and Citrus viroid IV (CVd-IV). CEVd and specific sequence variants of HSVd are the causal agents of the wellknown diseases of citrus, exocortis and cachexia. Other viroids have been found to induce different degrees of stunting. Since commercial citrus trees are commonly infected with mixtures of these viroids, only limited information is available on their effect in species other than Etrog citron. A field assay was conducted to establish the effect of each viroid on Commune clementine trees grafted on Pomeroy trifoliate orange. Infected trees were periodically monitored over a 12-year period (1990 to 2002) for symptom expression, growth, and fruit yield. Only CEVd caused bark scaling on the trifoliate orange rootstock and marked dwarfing, both characteristic of exocortis disease as initially described. In addition, very conspicuous bumps were observed in the wood of the rootstock after removing the bark. Only those HSVd variants, previously characterized as pathogenic in several cachexia-sensitive species, induced pits and gum deposits characteristic of this disease in the clementine scion. Bark cracking symptoms on the trifoliate orange rootstock were also observed. They were associated with CVd-IV, HSVd, or CEVd infection, but in the latter, they were only clearly observed in trees that showed mild scaling. Other abnormalities (deep pits, crests, and gummy pits) were not associated with viroid infection. No specific symptoms resulted from infection with CBLVd and CVd-III. HSVd, CVd-IV, and CBLVd had little or no effect in growth and yield, whereas CEVd and CVd-III caused a significant reduction of growth and yield, which became more pronounced over time with CEVd infection. Yield reduction was associated mainly with loss of production of large fruits. In general, there was a good correlation between reduction in vegetative growth and yield.",

      "abstract": "Grafting is a common practice for vegetative propagation and trait improvement in horticultural plants. A general prerequisite for successful grafting and long term survival of grafted plants is taxonomic proximity between the root stock and scion. For the success of a grafting operation, rootstock and scion should essentially be closely related. Interaction between the rootstock and scion involves complex physiological-biochemical and molecular mechanisms. Successful graft union formation involves a series of steps viz., lining up of vascular cambium, generation of a wound healing response, callus bridge formation, followed by vascular cambium formation and subsequent formation of the secondary xylem and phloem. For grafted trees compatibility between the rootstock/scion is the most essential factor for their better performance and longevity. Graft incompatibility occurs on account of a number of factors including of unfavorable physiological responses across the graft union, transmission of virus or phytoplasma and anatomical deformities of vascular tissue at the graft junction. In order to avoid the incompatibility problems, it is important to predict the same at an early stage. Phytohormones, especially auxins regulate key events in graft union formation between the rootstock and scion, while others function to facilitate the signaling pathways. Transport of macro as well as micro molecules across long distances results in phenotypic variation shown by grafted plants, therefore grafting can be used to determine the pattern and rate of recurrence of this transport. A better understanding of rootstock scion interactions, endogenous growth substances, soil or climatic factors needs to be studied, which would facilitate efficient selection and use of rootstocks in the future. Protein, hormones, mRNA and small RNA transport across the junction is currently emerging as an important mechanism which controls the stock/scion communication and simultaneously may play a crucial role in understanding the physiology of grafting more precisely. This review provides an understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular basis underlying grafting with special reference to horticultural plants.",

      "abstract": "In this review, encouraged by the dictum of Theodosius Dobzhansky that \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\", we outline the likely evolutionary pathways that have resulted in the observed similarities and differences of the extant molecules, biology, distribution, etc. of the potyvirids and, especially, its largest genus, the potyviruses. The potyvirids are a family of plant-infecting RNA-genome viruses. They had a single polyphyletic origin, and all share at least three of their genes (i.e., the helicase region of their CI protein, the RdRp region of their NIb protein and their coat protein) with other viruses which are otherwise unrelated. Potyvirids fall into 11 genera of which the potyviruses, the largest, include more than 150 distinct viruses found worldwide. The first potyvirus probably originated 15,000-30,000 years ago, in a Eurasian grass host, by acquiring crucial changes to its coat protein and HC-Pro protein, which enabled it to be transmitted by migrating host-seeking aphids. All potyviruses are aphid-borne and, in nature, infect discreet sets of monocotyledonous or eudicotyledonous angiosperms. All potyvirus genomes are under negative selection; the HC-Pro, CP, Nia, and NIb genes are most strongly selected, and the PIPO gene least, but there are overriding virus specific differences; for example, all turnip mosaic virus genes are more strongly conserved than those of potato virus Y. Estimates of dN/dS (ω) indicate whether potyvirus populations have been evolving as one or more subpopulations and could be used to help define species boundaries. Recombinants are common in many potyvirus populations (20%-64% in five examined), but recombination seems to be an uncommon speciation mechanism as, of 149 distinct potyviruses, only two were clear recombinants. Human activities, especially trade and farming, have fostered and spread both potyviruses and their aphid vectors throughout the world, especially over the past five centuries. The world distribution of potyviruses, especially those found on islands, indicates that potyviruses may be more frequently or effectively transmitted by seed than experimental tests suggest. Only two meta-genomic potyviruses have been recorded from animal samples, and both are probably contaminants.",

      "abstract": "While much recent science has focused on understanding and exploiting root traits as new opportunities for crop improvement, the use of rootstocks has enhanced productivity of woody perennial crops for centuries. Grafting of vegetable crops has developed very quickly in the last 50 years, mainly to induce shoot vigour and to overcome soil-borne diseases in solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops. In most cases, such progress has largely been due to empirical interactions between farmers, gardeners, and botanists, with limited insights into the underlying physiological mechanisms. Only during the last 20 years has science realized the potential of this old activity and studied the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in rootstock×scion interactions, thereby not only explaining old phenomena but also developing new tools for crop improvement. Rootstocks can contribute to food security by: (i) increasing the yield potential of elite varieties; (ii) closing the yield gap under suboptimal growing conditions; (iii) decreasing the amount of chemical (pesticides and fertilizers) contaminants in the soil; (iv) increasing the efficiency of use of natural (water and soil) resources; (v) generating new useful genotypic variability (via epigenetics); and (vi) creating new products with improved quality. The potential of grafting is as broad as the genetic variability able to cross a potential incompatibility barrier between the rootstock and the scion. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variability resulting from rootstock×scion×environment interactions will certainly contribute to developing and exploiting rootstocks for food security.",

      "abstract": "This article describes the resource- and system-building efforts of an 8-week Johns Hopkins University Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration (SCALE-2009) on Semantically Informed Machine Translation (SIMT). We describe a new modality/negation (MN) annotation scheme, the creation of a (publicly available) MN lexicon, and two automated MN taggers that we built using the annotation scheme and lexicon. Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation), a target (an action associated with modality or negation), and a holder (an experiencer of modality). We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86% (depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data set. We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations. Syntactic tags enriched with semantic annotations are assigned to parse trees in the target-language training texts through a process of tree grafting. Although the focus of our work is modality and negation, the tree grafting procedure is general and supports other types of semantic information. We exploit this capability by including named entities, produced by a pre-existing tagger, in addition to the MN elements produced by the taggers described here. The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu–English test set. This finding supports the hypothesis that both syntactic and semantic information can improve translation quality.",

      "abstract": "In Citrus, water, nutrient transport and thereby fruit production, are influenced among other factors, by the interaction between rootstock and boron (B) nutrition. This study aimed to investigate how B affects the anatomical structure of roots and leaves as well as leaf gas exchange in sweet orange trees grafted on two contrasting rootstocks in response to B supply. Plants grafted on Swingle citrumelo or Sunki mandarin were grown in a nutrient solution of varying B concentration (deficient, adequate, and excessive). Those grafted on Swingle were more tolerant to both B deficiency and toxicity than those on Sunki, as revealed by higher shoot and root growth. In addition, plants grafted on Sunki exhibited more severe anatomical and physiological damages under B deficiency, showing thickening of xylem cell walls and impairments in whole-plant leaf-specific hydraulic conductance and leaf CO2 assimilation. Our data revealed that trees grafted on Swingle sustain better growth under low B availablitlity in the root medium and still respond positively to increased B levels by combining higher B absorption and root growth as well as better organization of xylem vessels. Taken together, those traits improved water and B transport to the plant canopy. Under B toxicity, Swingle rootstock would also favor plant growth by reducing anatomical and ultrastructural damage to leaf tissue and improving water transport compared with plants grafted on Sunki. From a practical point of view, our results highlight that B management in citrus orchards shall take into account rootstock varieties, of which the Swingle rootstock was characterized by its performance on regulating anatomical and ultrastructural damages, improving water transport and limiting negative impacts of B stress conditions on plant growth.",

      "abstract": "Thirty-month-old 'Pêra' orange trees grafted on 'Rangpur' lemon trees grown in 100 L pots were submitted to water stress by the suspension of irrigation. CO2 assimilation (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (g s) values declined from the seventh day of stress, although the leaf water potential at 6:00 a.m. (psipd) and at 2:00 p.m. (psi2) began to decline from the fifth day of water deficiency. The CO2 intercellular concentration (Ci) of water-stressed plants increased from the seventh day, reaching a maximum concentration on the day of most severe stress. The carboxylation efficiency, as revealed by the ratio A/Ci was low on this day and did not show the same values of non-stressed plants even after ten days of rewatering. After five days of rewatering only psi pd and psi2 were similar to control plants while A, E and g s were still different. When psi2 decreases, there was a trend for increasing abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in the leaves. Similarly, stomatal conductance was found to decrease as a function of decreasing psi2. ABA accumulation and stomatal closure occurred when psi2 was lower than -1.0 MPa. Water stress in 'Pera´ orange trees increased abscisic acid content with consequent stomatal closure and decreased psi2 values.",

      "abstract": "The grafting of the rootstock with the lemon tree is an agronomical technique used to improve production and/or quality of the fruit. The interstock has been used with different fruit trees to modulate the tree size, fruit production and quality, and the aging of the tree. The lemon trees grafted with interstocks increase their longevity, lemon production and quality; interstocks are also used to decrease the thickness of the trunk at the grafting point. This enlarging of the trunk provokes a decrease of the sap flow. In our study, \"Verna\" lemon trees were grafted with interstock between the rootstock and the lemon tree to follow the flavonoid content of the lemon juice. The lemon juice was obtained from the lemons collected of the grafted lemon trees. Two types of rootstocks were used: Citrus aurantium L. and Citrus macrophylla L. Seven interstocks from five cultivars of orange tree, one cultivar of lime tree, and one cultivar of tangerine tree were used. \"Verna\" lemon trees were also grafted directly to the rootstock. The rootstock was more important agronomic factor than the interstock on the total flavonoid content of lemon juice. The interstock grafting had only a small influence on the flavonoid content of the lemon juice, and it modulated the individual flavonoid content. Citrus aurantium L. rootstock and \"Berna\" and \"Washington Navel\" interstocks were the most appropriate to graft in the lemon tree. This interstock grafting technique does not increase the flavonoid content of the lemon juice. Regarding the individual flavonoids, the 6,8-di-C-glucosyl diosmetin was the most affected flavonoid by the type of rootstock used. The interstock used is able to alter the individual quantitative flavonoid order of eriocitrin, diosmin, and hesperidin. In addition, the HPLC-ESI/MS(n) analyses provided the identification of two new flavonoids in the lemon juice: Quercetin 3-O-rutinoside-7-O-glucoside and chrysoeriol 6,8-di-C-glucoside (stellarin-2). The occurrence of apigenin 6,8-di-C-glucoside (vicenin-2), eriodictyol 7-O-rutinoside, 6,8-di-C-glucosyl diosmetin, hesperetin 7-O-rutinoside, homoeriodictyol 7-O-rutinoside and diosmetin 7-O-rutinoside was also confirmed in lemon juice by this technique.",

      "abstract": "Dwarfing rootstocks are a valuable genetic resource for managing high-density plantations. The selection of the appropriate scion/rootstock combination is key to improving crop performance and sustainable production in a particular environment and specific training systems. ‘Shatangju’ mandarin scion cultivar grafted onto ‘Flying Dragon’ rootstock tends to be dwarfing and develops short stature plants. To obtain insight into potential mechanisms underlying rootstock-induced dwarfing effects, we conducted a rootstock trial to examine the influence of 11 different rootstocks based on their growth vigor, antioxidants, and hormonal levels of the scion cultivar. The phenotypic observations revealed that size reduction in the ‘Flying Dragon’ rootstock is due to lower node number, shorter internodal length, and a reduced trunk diameter of the scion compared with more vigorous rootstocks. Antioxidant analysis showed that ‘Shatangju’ mandarin grafted onto ’Flying Dragon’ and ‘Trifoliate Orange’ rootstock had significantly lower peroxidase (POD) activity than other tested rootstocks. The hormonal analysis indicated that there were markedly lower amounts of abscisic acid (ABA) in ‘Shatangju’ mandarin grafted with ‘Flying Dragon’ rootstock. In addition, trees grafted with ‘Sour Pummelo’ and ‘Flying Dragon’ depicted minimum amounts of gibberellins (GA24). Moreover, several metabolites associated with organic acids, flavonoids, amino acids, and alkaloids responded differently in plants grafted with ‘Flying Dragon’ (dwarfing) and ‘Shatang Mandarin’ (vigorous) rootstocks. This study concluded that ‘Flying Dragon’ rootstock with a strong dwarfing effect has been proposed to improve high-density cultivation methods. These findings will provide useful insights for future research associated with rootstock-mediated dwarfing mechanisms of citrus rootstocks.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of water stress and different rootstocks on the quality indices and nutritional characteristics of peach fruit, cv. Suncrest. The results show how pre-harvest factors, such as the type of rootstock and water stress, can influence the quality indices and nutritional properties of peach fruits. Rootstocks type influenced both quality indices such as flesh firmness (FF) and soluble solid content (SSC), but it is unclear how rootstock exerted its influence. Also water stress induced changes in quality indices of peach fruit grafted on GF 677 and Montclar whereas minor effects were recorded when water stress was applied on Penta. The content of hydroxycinnamic acids was similar in control fruits of GF677, Montclar and Penta and it increased significantly only in fruit of trees grafted on GF 677 following water stress. Anthocyanins content in fruit of control plants was higher in Montclar in comparison with the fruit grafted on the other two rootstocks while procyanidin content was higher in fruit of control plants grafted on Penta. Following the water stress an increase in total anthocyanins was observed in GF 677 and Penta whereas no significant differences were found for Montclar. Water stress induced a significant decrease in procyanidin content in Penta. In conclusion in fruits of trees grafted on Penta following water stress quality indices did not show changes but significant variations in some phytochemicals, i.e. anthocyanins and procyanindins were observed. The results suggest that the regulation of water management is an important factor to maintain a good quality of the fruits. In fact, if irrigation stress can induce a higher biosynthesis of phytochemical compounds and an increase of SSC, at the same time, it can change fruit quality traits, such as a lower FW in Montclar, a higher titratable acidity (TA) in GF 677 and Penta and a lower FF in Gf 677 and Montclar.",

After 3 years of evaluation, the trees with the best appearance were those treated with ZnNO 3 (100 mg·L −1 Zn) and Zn-DTPA (100 mg·L −1 Zn), which showed leaf Zn concentration increases of 73% and 69%, respectively, when compared with the controls. The chlorophyll values of the Zn-treated trees reached 46 SPAD units, equivalent to 43 mg·kg −1 dry weight (DW) of chlorophyll compared with values of 22 mg·kg −1 DW in Zn-deficient leaves. On a leaf area basis, chlorophyll value was 37% lower under Zn deficiency conditions than that of Zn-treated trees. Nut quality was unaffected by the Zn treatments. Data suggest that Zn-DTPA and Zn-NO 3 are good options to carry out foliar Zn fertilization in pecan trees.",

      "abstract": "Citrus crops in the Mediterranean region are often grown in high pH calcareous soils, which promote nutrient imbalances, especially iron deficiency. ‘Navelina’ trees grafted on eight different citrus rootstocks were assessed in terms of their relative tolerance to these soils. To do so, leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were measured for 2 consecutive years in leaves without visible injury symptoms. Trees were grown on the rootstocks Carrizo citrange, hybrids of Cleopatra mandarin × Poncirus trifoliata no. 5 (F-A 5), 13 (F-A 13), and 16 (030116), Troyer citrange × common mandarin no. 18 (F-A 418), King mandarin × P. trifoliata no. 7 (F-A 517), 020324 (Troyer citrange × Cleopatra mandarin), and Volkamer lemon × P. trifoliata no. 64 (230164). g S and transpiration rate were clearly lower in leaves of shoots grafted on Carrizo citrange than in those on the other rootstocks assayed, but net photosynthetic flux did not differ. However, leaves of shoots on Carrizo citrange displayed a decline in their maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry [variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence (F v /F m ) ratio] and other chlorophyll parameters in the steady state such as photochemical quenching (q P ) and the quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Φ PSII ) as well as an increase in nonphotochemical quenching (q N ). Other rootstocks such as 030116, F-A 517 and, especially, F-A 5 showed the highest Φ PSII and F v /F m values, whereas F-A 5 had the lowest q N in the steady state. The photosynthetic characteristics observed in leaves on Carrizo citrange showed them to be the least tolerant to these calcareous conditions, whereas photosynthesis of ‘Navelina’ trees budded on F-A 5 were the most tolerant.",

      "abstract": "The global increase in species richness toward the tropics across continents and taxonomic groups, referred to as the latitudinal diversity gradient, stimulated the formulation of many hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of this pattern. We evaluate several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in a butterfly family, the Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generate a time-calibrated phylogeny containing 2,866 nymphalid species (~45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the latitudinal diversity gradient among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. The Neotropical diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and biotic interchanges with other regions are rare. Southeast Asia is also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, is the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, combined with tropical niche conservatism, played a major role in generating the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of nymphalid butterflies.",

Osbeck cv. Hamlin] trees, grafted onto rough lemon (RL; C. jambhiri Lush.) and sour orange (SO; C. aurantium L.) rootstocks. After 24 days of waterlogging, trees showed senescence, wilting and abscission of leaves, and these symptoms were more evident with flooded Hamlin/SO than Hamlin/RL. Reduction of leaf photosynthetic rate at day 24 was ca 94%, of stomatal conductance, 71%, of chlorophyll, 38% and of Rubisco, 62% for flooded Hamlin/SO, compared with 22, 5, 18 and 33%, respectively, for flooded Hamlin/RL. For both Hamlin/RL and Hamlin/SO, leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance to water vapor were closely correlated (r 2 = 0.87). Leaf internal CO 2 concentration of flooded trees, however, was not decreased by reduced stomatal conductance. Dark respiration rates of fibrous roots of flooded trees were greatly reduced, but not in leaf tissues. Total nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations were higher in leaves (50 and 80% increases for Hamlin/SO and Hamlin/RL, respectively), but drastically reduced in roots (60 and 45% reductions for Hamlin/SO and Hamlin/RL, respectively), as a result of flooding. The data indicate that Hamlin grafted onto RL rootstocks was more tolerant to soil flooding than Hamlin grafted onto SO rootstocks.",

      "abstract": "An orchard field trial was conducted to assess the utility of reduced rate Brassicaceae seed meal (SM) amendment in concert with specific rootstock genotypes for effective control of apple replant disease. Three amendment rates of a 1:1 formulation of Brassica juncea-Sinapis alba SM were compared with preplant 1,3-dichloropropene/chloropicrin soil fumigation for disease control efficacy. When applied at the highest rate (6.6 t ha −1 ) in the spring of planting, SM caused significant phytotoxicity and tree mortality, which was higher for Gala/M.26 than for Gala/G.41 but was not observed at SM application rates of 2.2 or 4.4 t ha −1 . SM treatment resulted in growth and yield increases of Gala/M.26 and Gala/G.41 trees in a manner similar to the fumigation treatment and significantly greater than the no treatment control. Tree growth in soils treated with SM at 4.4 t ha −1 was similar or superior to that obtained with SM at 6.6 t ha −1 and superior to that attained at an SM application rate of 2.2 t ha −1 . Soil fumigation and all SM treatments reduced Pratylenchus penetrans root infestation relative to the control treatment at the end of the initial growing season. Lesion nematode root densities in the fumigation treatment, but not SM treatments, rapidly recovered and were indistinguishable from the control at the end of the second growing season. Soil fumigation and all SM treatments significantly suppressed Pythium spp. root infection relative to the control. Trees grafted to rootstock G.41 possessed lower P. penetrans root densities relative to trees grafted to rootstock M.26. One year after planting, composition of microbial communities from SM-amended soils was distinct from those detected in control and fumigated soils, and the differences were amplified with increasing SM application rate. Specific fungal and bacterial phyla associated with suppression of plant pathogens were more abundant in SM-treated soil relative to the control, and they were similar in abundance in 4.4- and 6.6-t ha −1 SM treatments. Findings from this study demonstrated that use of the appropriate apple rootstock genotype will allow for effective replant disease control at SM application rates significantly less than that utilized previously (6.6 t ha −1 ).",

      "abstract": "The effects of shading in combination with salinity treatments were studied in citrus trees on two rootstocks with contrasting salt tolerance to determine if shading could reduce the negative effects of salinity stress. Well-nourished 2-year-old 'Valencia' orange trees grafted on Cleopatra mandarin (Cleo, relatively salt tolerant) or Carrizo citrange (Carr, relatively salt sensitive), were grown either under a 50% shade cloth or left unshaded in full sunlight. Half the trees received no salinity treatment and half were salinized with 50 mM Cl- during two 9 week salinity periods in the spring and autumn interrupted by an 11 week rainy period. The shade treatment reduced midday leaf temperature and leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit regardless of salinity treatments. In non-salinized trees, shade increased midday CO2 assimilation rate (A(CO2)) and stomatal conductance, but had no effect on leaf transpiration (E(lf)). Shade also increased leaf chlorophyll and photosynthetic water use efficiency (A(CO2)/E(lf)) in leaves on both rootstocks and increased total plant dry weight in Cleo. The salinity treatment reduced leaf growth and leaf gas exchange parameters. Shade decreased Cl- concentrations in leaves of salinized Carr trees, but had no effect on leaf or root Cl- of trees on Cleo. There were no significant differences in leaf gas exchange parameters of shaded and unshaded salinized plants but the growth reduction from salinity stress was actually greater for shaded than for unshaded trees. Shaded trees on both rootstocks had higher leaf Na+ than unshaded trees after the first salinity period, and this shade-induced elevated leaf Na+ persisted after the second salinity period in trees on Carr. Thus, shading did not alleviate the negative effects of salinity on growth and Na+ accumulation.",

Seasonal patterns of N translocation in the xylem sap as a consequence of remobilization were determined in 2-year-old 'Golden delicious' trees grafted on M9 rootstocks. The trees were grown in sand culture and (15)NH(4)(15)NO(3) at 10.4 atom% abundance supplied during August-September. The following year no further N was supplied and destructive harvests were taken during bud burst and leaf growth to determine the patterns of N remobilization together with the isolation of xylem sap for an analysis of their amino acid profiles and (15)N enrichments by GC-MS. The concentration of amino acids in the xylem sap rose following bud burst, peaked at full bloom and then fell again during petal fall and fruit set. The peak in amino acid concentration corresponded with the period when the rate of N remobilization was the fastest. The majority of labelled N was recovered in Asn, Gln + Glu and Asp demonstrating that they were being translocated as a consequence of remobilization. In a second experiment, 8-year-old trees growing in an orchard were fertilized with N either in the autumn or spring. Xylem sap samples were collected in the spring and early summer and, by comparison with the amino acid profiles recovered in trees from both treatments, Asn was identified as the main compound translocated as a consequence of both remobilization and root uptake of N, although there was evidence that root uptake of N occurred later. The data are discussed in relation to quantifying the internal cycling of N in trees.",

Here it is reported that a mobile signal, presumably the siRNA, produced from a hairpin structure transgene controlled by a companion cell-specific promoter can also induce transmissible TGS in both a modified agroinfiltration and a grafting system. Although the transmissible TGS occurred only in cells located in the vicinity of a leaf vein in the scion, very strong silencing was observed in the root system, especially the lateral roots, including the root apical meristem. The transmissible TGS was maintained through tissue culture and subsequently inherited by the progeny.

      "abstract": "Disentangling the drivers of global biodiversity patterns is a cornerstone of biogeography that remains elusive for many diverse biological groups. Here we present a complete species-level phylogeny of the ant subfamily Ponerinae based on new genomic sequencing and taxonomic grafting. We combine results with a large-scale geographic database to explore the contribution of three main mechanisms in shaping global ponerine biodiversity patterns: time for accumulation, differences in diversification rate, and asymmetric dispersal. We show that extant ponerine ants originated in Gondwana, spread eastward across tropical bioregions, and more recently colonized temperate areas. The relative timing of colonization events was identified as the prominent driver of present-day biodiversity patterns, supporting the time for accumulation hypothesis. Conversely, differences in diversification rates and asymmetrical dispersal histories mitigated the heterogeneity in biodiversity by fueling accumulation of lineages in the least diverse bioregions. These findings suggest that tropical niche conservatism played a major role in shaping the biogeographic and evolutionary history of Ponerinae. Overall, we emphasize the importance of considering the relative timing of past dispersal events and variations in diversification rates over evolutionary time to gain a deeper understanding of Earth's biodiversity patterns.",

      "abstract": "Citrus Sudden Death (CSD), a new, graft-transmissible disease of sweet orange and mandarin trees grafted on Rangpur lime rootstock, was first seen in 1999 in Brazil, where it is present in the southern Triângulo Mineiro and northwestern São Paulo State. The disease is a serious threat to the citrus industry, as 85% of 200 million sweet orange trees in the State of São Paulo are grafted on Rangpur lime. After showing general decline symptoms, affected trees suddenly collapse and die, in a manner similar to trees grafted on sour orange rootstock when affected by tristeza decline caused by infection with Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). In tristeza-affected trees, the sour orange bark near the bud union undergoes profound anatomical changes. Light and electron microscopic studies showed very similar changes in the Rangpur lime bark below the bud union of CSD-affected trees: size reduction of phloem cells, collapse and necrosis of sieve tubes, overproduction and degradation of phloem, accumulation of nonfunctioning phloem (NFP), and invasion of the cortex by old NFP. In both diseases, the sweet orange bark near the bud union was also affected by necrosis of sieve tubes, and the phloem parenchyma contained characteristic “chromatic” cells. In CSD-affected trees, these cells were seen not only in the sweet orange phloem, but also in the Rangpur lime phloem. Recent observations indicated that CSD affected not only citrus trees grafted on Rangpur lime but also those on Volkamer lemon, with anatomical symptoms similar to those seen in Rangpur lime bark. Trees on alternative rootstocks, such as Cleopatra mandarin and Swingle citrumelo, showed no symptoms of CSD. CSD-affected trees did recover when they were inarched with seedlings of these rootstocks, but not when inarched with Rangpur lime seedlings. These results indicate that CSD is a bud union disease. In addition, the bark of inarched Rangpur lime and Volkamer lemon seedlings showed, near the approach-graft union, the same anatomical alterations as the bud union bark from the Rangpur lime rootstock in CSD-affected trees. The dsRNA patterns from CSD-affected trees and unaffected trees were similar and indicative of CTV. CSD-affected trees did not react by immunoprinting-ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against 11 viruses. No evidence supported the involvement of viroids in CSD. The potential involvement of CTV and other viruses in CSD is discussed.",

The use of Flying Dragon trifoliate orange [ Poncirus trifoliata var. monstrosa (T.Itô) Swing.] (FD) rootstock could overcome these negative effects by inducing small trees with early production. Trials including eight commercial cultivars began in Dec. 1992 on an irrigated plot on the main island of New Caledonia (South Pacific). Growth of the trees was observed over a 13-year period through twice-yearly measurements of tree height, canopy between and in the rows, and trunk diameter. Fruit production was recorded beginning 2 years after planting. According to the climatic and pedological conditions of the experimental site, trees grafted on FD could, depending on cultivar, be planted in densities from 519 to 1111 trees/ha. Over the 13 years, yields were 0.5 to 2.8 times greater than those of the same cultivar on the standard rootstock. ‘Tahiti’ lime cumulative planting and maintenance costs were only 1.5 times higher for a density five times as great, and the level of productivity per hectare (gross margin/ha) was 3.3 times that of traditional orchards. Grafting citrus cultivars on FD, which is seldom used in the Mediterranean zone as a result of its excessive dwarfing effect in relation with the climatic conditions, could prove, on the other hand, promising in tropical areas.",

      "abstract": "In three separate experiments, the growth and water use of salinized citrus rootstock seedlings and grafted trees were modified using different growth substrates, elevated CO 2 , or 50% shade screen under field conditions. By reanalyzing previously published data, we tested the hypothesis that salinity tolerance in citrus can be characterized as the ability to maintain low levels of leaf Cl − accumulation through high plant growth and high water use efficiency (WUE) under saline conditions. Well-irrigated salinized seedlings of the relatively salt-sensitive Carrizo citrange [Carr ( Citrus sinensis × Poncirus trifoliata )] were grown in sand, clay, or a peat-based soilless media. Salinity stress reduced plant growth and water use. Leaf Cl − concentration was negatively related to plant growth, but leaf Cl − increased with transpiration rate in low-saline treatments. In a second experiment using salinized seedlings of the relatively salt-tolerant Cleopatra mandarin [Cleo ( Citrus reticulata )] grown along with Carr seedlings with or without elevated CO 2 , leaf Cl − was negatively related to growth and to shoot/root dry weight ratio, but was positively related to water use such that leaf Cl − was negatively related to leaf WUE. In a third experiment using salinized 2-year-old ‘Valencia’ orange ( C. sinensis ) trees grafted on Cleo or Carr rootstocks and grown with or without shadecloth, leaf Cl − was positively related to leaf transpiration as both were higher in the spring than in the fall, regardless of rootstock or shade treatment. Overall, leaf Cl − was positively related to water use and was negatively related to leaf WUE. High growth, low water use, and consequently, high WUE of salinized citrus were related to low leaf Cl − . Such relationships can be used as indicators of salinity tolerance.",

      "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate rootstock for a specific scion cultivar is an efficient way to improve both yield and berry quality in viticulture. This study aimed to provide practical guidance for rootstock selection in the cultivation of the table grape cultivar 'Fengguang'. The mature scions of this cultivar were grafted onto hardwood cuttings of eight different resistant rootstocks, which included 101-14M, 110R, 188-08, 3309C, 5BB, 5C, SO4, and Beta, with the own-rooted vines as control. Graft compatibility, growth vigor, yield performance, and fruit quality were compared and analyzed among the different grafting combinations. The results suggested that vines on 101-14M, 5BB, and Beta obtained higher germination rates of scions, better healing rates of the mating interface, and greater generation rates of root callus. Among these, vines on 5BB exhibited the largest scion trunk cross-sectional diameter. Furthermore, SO4 demonstrated the most significant improvement in yield, with an average increase of 13.54% compared to the control. Regarding berry quality, 101-14M significantly enhanced berry mass, pressure resistance, and flesh firmness relative to the controls, with average improvements of 7.67%, 11.34%, and 29.86%, respectively. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of yield and fruit quality indicators, 101-14M gained the highest value. In conclusion, 101-14M is preferentially recommended for grafting cultivation of 'Fengguang' vines. These findings could provide practical guidance for the cultivation of table grape cultivars.",

      "abstract": "Kiwifruit, with its unique flavor, nutritional value, and economic benefits, has gained significant attention in agriculture production. Kiwifruit plants have traditionally been propagated without grafting, but recently, grafting has become a more common practice. A new and complex disease called Kiwifruit Vine Decline Syndrome (KVDS) has emerged in different kiwifruit-growing areas. The syndrome was first recognized in Italy, although similar symptoms had been observed in New Zealand during the 1990s before subsequently spreading worldwide. While kiwifruit was not initially grafted in commercial orchards, the expansion of cultivation into regions with heavy soils or other challenging environmental conditions may make grafting selected kiwifruit cultivars onto KVDS-resistant or -tolerant rootstocks essential for the future of this crop. Grafting is a common horticultural practice, widely used to propagate several commercially important fruit crops, including kiwifruits, apples, grapes, citrus, peaches, apricots, and vegetables. Grafting methods and genetic compatibility have a crucial impact on fruit quality, yield, environmental adaptability, and disease resistance. Achieving successful compatibility involves a series of steps. During grafting, some scion/rootstock combinations exhibit poor graft compatibility, preventing the formation of a successful graft union. Identifying symptoms of graft incompatibility can be challenging, as they are not always evident in the first year after grafting. The causes of graft incompatibility are still largely unknown, especially in the case of kiwifruit. This review aims to examine the mechanisms of graft compatibility and incompatibility across different fruit crops. This review's goal is to identify potential markers and techniques that could enhance grafting success and boost the commercial production of kiwifruit.",

      "abstract": "Pear propagation is primarily achieved through asexual reproduction via grafting. During the graft union healing process, there is metabolic exchange between the rootstock and the scion. However, a multi-omics systematic study on the role of sugar in the graft union healing process has not been reported. In this study, using micrografting techniques, we comparatively analyzed the metabolic changes during the healing process in homograft and heterograft of pear through metabolomics and transcriptomics. We found significant differences in sugar metabolism pathways after grafting. In the fructose and mannose metabolic pathways, sorbitol exhibited opposite trends in homograft and heterograft. Subsequent transcriptomics analysis confirmed that these metabolite changes were caused by differential expression of related synthetic and converting enzyme genes. Furthermore, spatial metabolomics identified sorbitol accumulation in the scion after homologous grafting. To further verify the role of sorbitol, exogenous sorbitol treatment was applied, revealing that it enhanced tissue adhesion, shortened the time required for callus growth, promoted high expression of xylem formation genes and cambium differentiation genes, and facilitated the reconnection of xylem and phloem, thereby playing a positive role in graft union healing. This study systematically analyzed changes in sugar metabolism during the grafting process and confirmed that sorbitol can promote graft union healing.",

Citrus tolerance to ions that predominate in DSW and water stress depends on the rootstock. Deficit irrigation was applied to DSW-irrigated lemon trees and grafted on rootstocks with different tolerance (Citrus macrophylla (CM) and sour orange (SO)). Plants were irrigated with DSW or Control treatment (distilled water), and, 140 days later, irrigation treatments were started: full irrigation (FI) or DI (50% of the volume applied to FI). After 75 days, differences between CM and SO plants irrigated with DSW and under DI were found. The higher concentrations of Cl− and Na+ in CM and B in SO were the main causes of shoot growth reduction. The osmotic adjustment of CM plants was made possible by the accumulation of Na+, Cl−, and proline, but SO failed to adjust osmotically. In CM and SO plants, photosynthesis reduction was due to lower chlorophyll levels, but also to stomatal factors (CM plants) or alterations of the photochemical machinery (SO plants). Finally, unlike CM, SO had a good antioxidant system. In the future, knowing the different responses of CM and SO under these stressful conditions could be useful in citrus-growing areas.",

Although previous studies have been carried out to understand the effect of <i>Ca</i>Las on the flavour of orange juice using metabolomic methods, the mechanisms leading to the off-flavour that occurs in Huanglongbing (HLB)-symptomatic fruit are not well understood. In this study, fruits were collected from symptomatic and healthy Valencia sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>) trees grafted on Swingle (<i>C. paradisi</i> X <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) rootstock. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to measure the proteins, sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and volatile terpenoids. The results showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and amino-acid biosynthesis were degraded, and terpenoid metabolism was significantly downregulated in the symptomatic fruit. Valencene, limonene, 3-carene, linalool, myrcene, and α-terpineol levels were significantly lower in fruit from <i>Ca</i>Las-infected trees than from healthy trees. Similar phenomena were observed for sucrose and glucose. Our study indicated that off-flavour of symptomatic fruit was associated with a reduction in the levels of terpenoid products and the downregulation of proteins in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway.",

Currently, the tool provides annotations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and PANTHER family and subfamily. The approach is generalizable to any annotations that have been made to internal nodes of a reference phylogenetic tree. TreeGrafter takes each input query protein sequence, finds the best matching homologous family in a library of pre-calculated, pre-annotated gene trees, and then grafts it to the best location in the tree. It then annotates the sequence by propagating annotations from ancestral nodes in the reference tree. We show that TreeGrafter outperforms subfamily HMM scoring for correctly assigning subfamily membership, and that it produces highly specific annotations of GO terms based on annotated reference phylogenetic trees. This method will be further integrated into InterProScan, enabling an even broader user community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>TreeGrafter is freely available on the web at https://github.com/pantherdb/TreeGrafter, including as a Docker image.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Tanaka), Red tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco), 'Shatangju' mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), Rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush) and Canton lemon (Citrus limonia Osbeck). The tree size of 'Shatangju' mandarin grafted onto Canton lemon and Rough lemon were the largest, followed by self-rooted rootstock trees, and the lowest tree sizes correspond to ones grafted on Red tangerine and Fragrant orange rootstocks. The levels of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin (GA) were significantly and positively related to growth vigor. The differences of gene expression in leaves of trees grafted onto Red tangerine, Canton lemon and 'Shatangju' mandarin were analyzed by RNA-Seq. Results showed that more differentially expressed genes involved in oxidoreductase function, hormonal signal transduction and the glycolytic pathway were enriched in 'Red tangerine vs Canton lemon'. qRT-PCR analysis showed that expression levels of ARF1, ARF8, GH3 and IAA4 were negatively correlated with the growth vigor and IAA content. The metabolism of GA was influenced by the differential expression of KO1 and GA2OX1 in grafted trees. In addition, most of antioxidant enzyme genes were up-regulated in leaves of trees grafted onto Red tangerine, resulting in a higher peroxidase activity. We concluded that different rootstocks significantly affected the expression of genes involved in auxin signal transduction pathway and GA biosynthesis pathway in the grafted plants, and then regulated the hormone levels and their signal pathways.",

      "abstract": "Specific rootstocks can differentially influence the vegetative growth and development of fruit trees. However, the physiological mechanism involved in this phenomenon has been elusive. Recent research comparing different peach ( Prunus persica L. Batsch) rootstocks suggests that the rootstock effect on vegetative growth in peach trees is associated to water relations and more specifically to differences in rootstock hydraulic conductance. This study was intended to confirm differences in hydraulic characteristics of similar size peach trees grafted on different rootstocks and to examine root system characteristics that could be associated with rootstock hydraulic limitations. Trees on rootstocks that were known to have a size‐controlling effect when grown under field conditions had lower rootstock conductance than trees on the vigorous (control) rootstock when rootstock hydraulic conductance was measured with both the high‐pressure and evaporative flow methods. Rootstocks with the lowest hydraulic conductance had less fine root surface area and length per unit root dry weight than the more vigorous (control) rootstock. However, contrary to previous field studies, in this study there were no significant differences in dry matter production and distribution among trees on the different rootstocks suggesting that whatever the normal growth control mechanism was, it did not differentially influence growth under the specific conditions of this study. This research confirmed that peach rootstocks exhibiting size‐controlling behavior under field conditions differed in their hydraulic and morphological characteristics under controlled growth conditions even when those growth conditions negated the expression of the size‐controlling behavior.",

The coarse‐root dynamics of ramets of Populus tremuloides (aspen) were investigated with respect to persistence of the original root connections (roots of parent trees from which the ramets originated), the time of establishment of new roots at the base of the stem and the fate of the communal root system after death of individual trees. Parts of the root systems of three declining stands of aspen ramets were hydraulically excavated. From each stand, sections of all structural roots were collected at the base of live and dead trees and were analysed using dendrochronology techniques. Parent roots were identified in the root system of every tree. The trees initiated new structural roots shortly after suckering. Live roots were often connected to the stump of dead and decayed trees. Grafting was common, especially at or near the stumps. Death of trees along the parent roots over time did not seem to favour the entry of significant decay, nor promote breakage of the original root connections. Instead of becoming independent of the parent root system the ramets incorporated the parent roots into their own root systems, remaining interconnected.",

Compared with the well-watered control, drought treatment limited growth, as manifested by smaller increments in plant height (PH), trunk diameter (TD), total fresh biomass (TB), total dry biomass (TDB), total leaf area (LA), and relative growth rate (RGR). The extent of this effect differed among rootstocks. Stress conditions led to increases in the root/shoot ratio (RSR), leaf thickness (LT), water-holding capacity (WHC), carbon isotope composition (δ13C), and WUE. Decreases were noted in stomatal density (SD), leaf relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content (Chl), net photosynthetic rate (P N), transpiration rate (E), and stomatal conductance (g s), again varying by rootstock. Those that are generally considered more drought-tolerant, e.g., M. sieversii, M. prunifolia, and M. toringoides, had smaller declines in PH, TD, TB, TDB, LA, RGR, SD, RWC, Chl, P N, E, and g s and proportionally greater increases in RSR, LT, WHC, δ13C, and WUE compared with the droughtsensitive M. hupehensis and M. sieboldii. These results suggest that moisture stress has a significant dwarfing effect in the latter two species. Based on WUE calculations, trees on drought-tolerant rootstocks showed higher tolerance when stressed, whereas those on drought-sensitive rootstocks were less tolerant, as indicated by their lower WUE values.",

      "abstract": "In spring 2013, 5-year-old nectarine (Prunus persica) trees, grafted on peach rootstock Nemaguard, were found stunted in a propagation block in California. These trees had been propagated from budwood of three nectarine cultivars imported from France and cleared through the post-entry quarantine procedure. Examination of the canopy failed to reveal any obvious symptoms. However, examination of the trunks, after stripping the bark, revealed extensive pitting on the woody cylinder. To investigate the etiological agent, double-stranded RNA was extracted from bark scrapings from the scion and rootstock portions, and a cDNA library was prepared and sequenced using the Illumina platform. BLAST analysis of the contigs generated by the de novo assembly of sequence reads indicated the presence of a novel luteovirus. Complete sequence of the viral genome was determined by sequencing of three overlapping cDNA clones generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by rapid amplification of the 5′- and 3′-termini. The virus genome was comprised of 4,991 nucleotides with a gene organization similar to members of the genus Luteovirus (family Luteoviridae). The presence of the virus, tentatively named Nectarine stem pitting-associated virus, was confirmed in symptomatic trees by RT-PCR. Discovery of a new virus in nectarine trees after post-entry quarantine indicates the importance of including (i) metagenomic analysis by next-generation sequencing approach as an essential tool to assess the plant health status, and (ii) examination of the woody cylinders as part of the indexing process.",

      "abstract": "We conducted a large (0.8 ha) field experiment of system × rootstock, using Super Chief Delicious apple as cultivar at Yonder farm in Hudson, NY, between 2007 and 2017. In this study, we compared six Geneva ® rootstocks (‘G.11’, ‘G.16’, ‘G.210’, ‘G.30’, ‘G.41’, and ‘G.935’) with one Budagovsky (‘B.118’) and three Malling rootstocks (‘M.7EMLA’, ‘M.9T337’ and ‘M.26EMLA’). Trees on each rootstock were trained to four high-density systems: Super Spindle (SS) (5382 apple trees/ha), Tall Spindle (TS) (3262 apple trees/ha), Triple Axis Spindle (TAS) (2243 apple trees/ha), and Vertical Axis (VA) (1656 apple trees/ha). Rootstock and training system interacted to influence growth, production, and fruit quality. When comparing systems, SS trees were the least vigorous but much more productive on a per hectare basis. Among the rootstocks we evaluated, ‘B.118’ had the largest trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), followed by ‘G.30’ and ‘M.7EMLA’, which were similar in size but they did not differ statistically from ‘G.935’. ‘M.9T337’ was the smallest and was significantly smaller than most of the other rootstocks but it did not differ statistically from ‘G.11’, ‘G.16’, ‘G.210’, ‘G.41’, and ‘M.26EMLA’. Although ‘B.118’ trees were the largest, they had low productivity, whereas the second largest rootstock ‘G.30’ was the most productive on a per hectare basis. ‘M.9’ was the smallest rootstock and failed to adequately fill the space in all systems except the SS, and had low cumulative yield. The highest values for cumulative yield efficiency (CYE) were with ‘G.210’ for all training systems except for VA, where ‘M.9T337’ had the highest value. The lowest values were for all training systems with ‘B.118’ and ‘M.7EMLA’. Regardless of the training system, ‘M.7EMLA’ trees had the highest number of root suckers.

      "abstract": "Конкуренция деревьев за свет, влагу и элементы питания обычно рассматривается как основной фактор взаимодействия между ними, но эта идея подвергается сомнению примерами сотрудничества или кооперации посредством естественных корневых срастаний. В связи с обсуждением феномена срастания корней растений получил развитие важнейший в биологии вопрос о взаимоотношениях между отдельными видами и особями внутри вида. Корневое срастание может влиять на физиологию и экологию сросшихся деревьев, однако процессы, способствующие его образованию, вовлеченные факторы и их действие неизвестны. Остается не определенным влияние живых пней на растущее дерево. Известно, что срастание корней обеспечивает повышенную механическую устойчивость деревьев в их противостоянии ветру и сопряжено с такими факторами, как изменчивость морфологии корней, структуры и влажности почвы, а также степени взаимного перекрытия корней. Частота срастания корней увеличивается как с возрастом древостоя, так и с его густотой. Через срастания корней происходят перетоки патогенов, минеральных веществ, углеводов, гормонов, гербицидов, микроорганизмов и воды, однако названные процессы фактически не имеют количественной основы. Моделирование перетоков воды между сросшимися деревьями в мангровых лесах на количественном уровне показало, что между деревьями одинакового размера водообмен отсутствует или имеется в незначительном объеме; перемещение воды происходит от господствующего дерева к угнетенному и от дерева, растущего во влажных условиях, к дереву, растущему во влагодефицитных условиях, количество воды, получаемой деревом, по сравнению с его собственным потреблением выше, если дерево-партнер крупнее. Количественный подход к оценке биологической и экологической роли корневых срастаний закладывает основу для понимания их влияния на формирование и продуктивность древостоя.\n                                                                                            The competition of trees for light, moisture and nutrients is usually considered as the main factor of interaction between trees, but this idea is questioned by examples of cooperation or cooperation through natural root grafting. In connection with the discussion of the phenomenon of plant root grafting, the most important question in biology about the relationship between individual species and individuals within a species has been developed. The importance of root grafting lies in its ability to influence the physiology and ecology of grafted trees, however, the processes contributing to the formation of root grafting, the factors involved and their effects are unknown. The question of whether the root grafting is accidental or a natural phenomenon is still controversial. The effect of live stumps on a growing tree remains uncertain. It is known that root grafting provides increased mechanical stability of trees in their resistance to wind and is associated with factors such as variability in root morphology, soil structure and moisture, as well as the degree of mutual root overlap. The frequency of root grafting increases both with the age of the stand and with its density. Pathogens, minerals, carbohydrates, hormones, herbicides, microorganisms and water flow through root grafting, but these processes actually have no quantitative basis. Modeling of water flows between grafted trees in mangrove forests at the quantitative level showed that there is no water exchange between trees of the same size or there is an insignificant amount; water movement occurs from the dominant tree to the oppressed one; water movement occurs from a tree growing in humid conditions to a tree growing in non-scarce conditions, and the amount of water received, compared to its own consumption, it is higher if the partner tree is larger. A quantitative approach to assessing the biological and ecological role of root grafting lays the foundation for understanding their impact on the formation and productivity of a stand.",

However, traditional grafting methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive and have problems such as high cost and low efficiency. This study tested the most preferred method of grafting walnut propagation, the tongue-and-groove graft grafting method. It aimed to accelerate the grafting process, increase efficiency, and reduce production costs. The performance of prototype clips was evaluated using field trials in the study. A portable tongue-and-groove graft machine and manual labor methods were used in the grafting processes. The study results show that the new grafting clip significantly shortens the grafting time compared to traditional methods and increases graft retention rates. In the plastic graft tie application, 75.6% of the grafts made by hand and 62.2% produced by the grafting machine were successful. In the clip application, 86.7% of the grafts made by hand and 68.9% of the grafts made by the grafting machine were successful. Compared with the traditional and modern grafting methods in the literature, it was revealed that the developed clip reduces the need for labor and offers an innovative product with commercialization potential.

We demonstrated that <i>JrGA20ox1</i>-OE and <i>JrGA20ox1</i>-RNAi rootstocks could transport active gibberellins (GAs) and <i>JrGA20ox1</i>-RNAi vector-produced sRNAs to WT scions under PEG-simulated drought stress, respectively. The movement of sRNAs further led to a successive decline in <i>JrGA20ox1</i> expression and active GA content. Meanwhile, unknown mobile signals may move between rootstocks and scions. These mobile signals reduced the expression of a series of GA-responsive and GA-non-responsive genes, and induced ROS production in guard cells and an increase in ABA content, which may contribute to the drought tolerance of WT/RNAi, while the opposite occurred in WT/OE. The findings suggest that <i>JrGA20ox1</i>-derived rootstock-to-scion movement of signals is involved in drought tolerance of scions. Our research will provide a feasible approach for studying signal communication in woody plants.",

After 10 years, trees on ‘Borchard’ were larger than trees on all other rootstocks. Trees on all rootstocks displayed an alternate-bearing pattern, typical of avocado. Alternate-bearing was most pronounced in trees grafted onto ‘Topa Topa’ and ‘Toro Canyon’. Rootstocks in the G755 series had the lowest alternate-bearing index, but also had the lowest yields.Trees on ‘Duke 7’ and ‘Borchard’ had the highest cumulative yields, and trees on G755A, G755B, and G755C had the lowest yields. Differences in yield were due to differences in the number of fruit per tree, not individual fruit weight. When yield was evaluated in terms of canopy efficiency (kg fruit m–3), no rootstock outperformed ‘Duke 7’, the industry standard rootstock. Leaf concentrations of all nutrients examined (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cl, Mn, B, Fe, and Cu) were within, or close to the recommended ranges. P, Ca, and S were higher, and Fe was lower in high-yielding years in all rootstocks.",

      "abstract": "Architectural analysis was applied to study branch development of 'Royal Gala' apple trees grafted with dwarfing and non-dwarfing rootstock/interstock combinations, which had been chosen to produce trees with a wide range of vigour. Using AMAPmod methodology, the structure of 3-year-old branches was described at four levels of representation: branch; annual shoot; growth unit; and node. Three types of growth units were distinguished: extension growth unit (vegetative unit with internode extension); vegetative spur with minimal internode extension; and fruiting spur or bourse. The aim of the analysis was to describe exactly how the rootstock/interstock combinations affected the structure building process. The number of extension growth units, vegetative spurs and fruiting spurs per annual shoot changed over the years, but this was not affected by rootstock/interstock combination. Compared with MM.106 rootstock, M.9 rootstock reduced the number of nodes per extension growth unit. In most cases, rootstock/interstock combination had no effect on the linear relationship between extension growth unit length and node number (R(2) = 0.88). Average internode length depended on unit node number, with internodes being shorter for units with fewer nodes. Thus the difference in apple branch size induced by the rootstock/interstock combinations was mainly due to a reduction in the length and number of neoformed nodes produced on extension growth units. As percentage budbreak of axillary buds on extension growth units was not affected by rootstock/interstock combination, differences in numbers of axillary annual shoots per branch were entirely due to differences in the total numbers of nodes extended during the previous year.",

      "abstract": "We aim to enable the accurate and efficient transfer of knowledge about gene function gained from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and other model organisms to other plant species. This knowledge transfer is frequently challenging in plants due to duplications of individual genes and whole genomes in plant lineages. Such duplications result in complex evolutionary relationships between related genes, which may have similar sequences but highly divergent functions. In such cases, functional inference requires more than a simple sequence similarity calculation. We have developed an online resource, PhyloGenes (phylogenes.org), that displays precomputed phylogenetic trees for plant gene families along with experimentally validated function information for individual genes within the families. A total of 40 plant genomes and 10 non-plant model organisms are represented in over 8,000 gene families. Evolutionary events such as speciation and duplication are clearly labeled on gene trees to distinguish orthologs from paralogs. Nearly 6,000 families have at least one member with an experimentally supported annotation to a Gene Ontology (GO) molecular function or biological process term. By displaying experimentally validated gene functions associated to individual genes within a tree, PhyloGenes enables functional inference for genes of uncharacterized function, based on their evolutionary relationships to experimentally studied genes, in a visually traceable manner. For the many families containing genes that have evolved to perform different functions, PhyloGenes facilitates the use of evolutionary history to determine the most likely function of genes that have not been experimentally characterized. Future work will enrich the resource by incorporating additional gene function datasets such as plant gene expression atlas data.",

      "abstract": "Germline mutation is the mechanism by which genetic variation in a population is created. Inferences derived from mutation rate models are fundamental to many population genetics methods. Previous models have demonstrated that nucleotides flanking polymorphic sites-the local sequence context-explain variation in the probability that a site is polymorphic. However, limitations to these models exist as the size of the local sequence context window expands. These include a lack of robustness to data sparsity at typical sample sizes, lack of regularization to generate parsimonious models and lack of quantified uncertainty in estimated rates to facilitate comparison between models. To address these limitations, we developed Baymer, a regularized Bayesian hierarchical tree model that captures the heterogeneous effect of sequence contexts on polymorphism probabilities. Baymer implements an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme to estimate the posterior distributions of sequence-context based probabilities that a site is polymorphic. We show that Baymer accurately infers polymorphism probabilities and well-calibrated posterior distributions, robustly handles data sparsity, appropriately regularizes to return parsimonious models, and scales computationally at least up to 9-mer context windows. We demonstrate application of Baymer in three ways-first, identifying differences in polymorphism probabilities between continental populations in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 dataset, second, in a sparse data setting to examine the use of polymorphism models as a proxy for de novo mutation probabilities as a function of variant age, sequence context window size, and demographic history, and third, comparing model concordance between different great ape species. We find a shared context-dependent mutation rate architecture underlying our models, enabling a transfer-learning inspired strategy for modeling germline mutations. In summary, Baymer is an accurate polymorphism probability estimation algorithm that automatically adapts to data sparsity at different sequence context levels, thereby making efficient use of the available data.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of cloud computing (CC) has increased significantly in recent years due to its cost-effectiveness and simplified resource allocation. Owing to the exponential rise of cloud computing in the past decade, many corporations and businesses have moved to the cloud to ensure accessibility, scalability, and transparency. The proposed research involves comparing the accuracy and fault prediction of five machine learning algorithms: AdaBoostM1, Bagging, Decision Tree (J48), Deep Learning (Dl4jMLP), and Naive Bayes Tree (NB Tree). The results from secondary data analysis indicate that the Central Processing Unit CPU-Mem Multi classifier has the highest accuracy percentage and the least amount of fault prediction. This holds for the Decision Tree (J48) classifier with an accuracy rate of 89.71% for 80/20, 90.28% for 70/30, and 92.82% for 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the Hard Disk Drive HDD-Mono classifier has an accuracy rate of 90.35% for 80/20, 92.35% for 70/30, and 90.49% for 10-fold cross-validation. The AdaBoostM1 classifier was found to have the highest accuracy percentage and the least amount of fault prediction for the HDD Multi classifier with an accuracy rate of 93.63% for 80/20, 90.09% for 70/30, and 88.92% for 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, the CPU-Mem Mono classifier has an accuracy rate of 77.87% for 80/20, 77.01% for 70/30, and 77.06% for 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the primary data results, the Naive Bayes Tree (NB Tree) classifier is found to have the highest accuracy rate with less fault prediction of 97.05% for 80/20, 96.09% for 70/30, and 96.78% for 10 folds cross-validation. However, the algorithm complexity is not good, taking 1.01 seconds. On the other hand, the Decision Tree (J48) has the second-highest accuracy rate of 96.78%, 95.95%, and 96.78% for 80/20, 70/30, and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. J48 also has less fault prediction but with a good algorithm complexity of 0.11 seconds. The difference in accuracy and less fault prediction between NB Tree and J48 is only 0.9%, but the difference in time complexity is 9 seconds. Based on the results, we have decided to make modifications to the Decision Tree (J48) algorithm. This method has been proposed as it offers the highest accuracy and less fault prediction errors, with 97.05% accuracy for the 80/20 split, 96.42% for the 70/30 split, and 97.07% for the 10-fold cross-validation.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Anthropogenic activities are causing unprecedented loss of genetic diversity in many species. However, the effects on genetic diversity from large-scale grafting onto wild plants of crop species are largely undetermined. Iron walnut (Juglans sigillata Dode) is a deciduous nut tree crop endemic to southwestern China with a long history of cultivation. Due to the rapid expansion of the walnut industry, many natural populations are now being replaced by cultivars grafted onto wild rootstocks. However, little is known about the potential genetic consequences of such action on natural populations.<h4>Results</h4>We sampled the scion and the rootstock from each of 149 grafted individuals within nine wild populations of J. sigillata from Yunnan Province which is the center of walnut diversity and cultivation in China, and examined their genetic diversity and population structure using 31 microsatellite loci. Scions had lower genetic diversity than rootstocks, and this pattern was repeated in seven of the nine examined populations. Among those seven populations, AMOVA and clustering analyses showed a clear genetic separation between all rootstocks and all scions. However, the two remaining populations, both from northern Yunnan, showed genetic similarity between scions and rootstocks, possibly indicating that wild populations here are derived from feralized local cultivars. Moreover, our data indicated probable crop-to-wild gene flow between scions and rootstocks, across all populations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results indicate that large-scale grafting has been causing genetic diversity erosion and genetic structure breakdown in the wild material of J. sigillata within Yunnan. To mitigate these effects, we caution against the overuse of grafting in wild populations of iron walnut and other crop species and recommend the preservation of natural genotypes through in situ  and ex situ conservation.",

      "abstract": "Citrus are natural hosts of several viroid species. Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) are the causal agents of two well-known diseases of citrus, exocortis and cachexia. Other viroids have been found to induce specific symptoms and different degrees of stunting in trees grafted on trifoliate orange and trifoliate orange hybrids. A field assay was initiated in 1989 to establish the effect of CEVd, HSVd, Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd), Citrus dwarfing viroid (CDVd), and Citrus bark cracking viroid (CBCVd) on Washington navel sweet orange trees grafted on Carrizo citrange rootstock. Here we report the effect of viroid infection on symptom expression, tree size, fruit production and quality evaluated from 2004 to 2007. Vegetative growth was affected by viroid infection with height and canopy volume being reduced. No bark scaling symptoms were observed in CEVd-infected trees albeit they presented lesions and blisters in the roots. Bark cracking symptoms were consistently observed in CBCVd-infected trees that were smaller with enhanced productivity and fruit size. No major effects were found as a result of infection with CBLVd, HSVd, or CDVd. The quality of the fruits was not affected by viroid infection, except for the low diameter of the fruits harvested from HSVd-infected trees. An interesting effect was identified in terms of tree productivity increase (yield/canopy volume) as a result of infection with CEVd, CDVd, and especially CBCVd.",

      "abstract": "Grafting is a widely used practice for asexual propagation of fruit trees. Many physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes occur upon grafting that can influence important horticultural traits. This technology has many advantages, including avoidance of juvenility, modifying the scion architecture, improving productivity, adapting scion cultivars to unfavourable environmental conditions, and developing traits in resistance to insect pests, bacterial and fungal diseases. A limitation of grafting is scion-rootstock incompatibility. It may be caused by many factors, including insufficient genetic proximity, physiological or biochemical factors, lignification at the graft union, poor graft architecture, insufficient cell recognition between union tissues, and metabolic differences in the scion and the rootstock. Plant hormones, like auxin, ethylene (ET), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), and jasmonic acid (JA) orchestrate several crucial physiological and biochemical processes happening at the site of the graft union. Additionally, epigenetic changes at the union affect chromatin architecture by DNA methylation, histone modification, and the action of small RNA molecules. The mechanism triggering these effects likely is affected by hormonal crosstalk, protein and small molecules movement, nutrients uptake, and transport in the grafted trees. This review provides an overview of the basis of physiological, biochemical, and molecular aspects of fruit tree grafting between scion and rootstock.",

Sometimes donor site becomes painful and leaves a second wound or scar which may take longer time to cure than the primary graft site itself. Epidermal grafting (Blister graft/Suction graft) is an alternative method of skin grafting in which we apply continuous negative pressure on the skin to harvest the epidermal layer of the skin. This procedure leaves minimal donor site morbidity or scar and is relatively less painful. It can be done on an outpatient basis. In our study, we try to compare STSG and Epidermal grafts and the mechanism by which each technique achieves wound healing.",

Osb.] grafted on the following ‘Trifoliata’ hybrid rootstocks: ‘US-852’, IPEACS-256 and IPEACS-264 citrandarins, and F.80-3, ‘W-2’ citrumelo, and ‘Swingle’ citrumelo (control), was assessed in three different subtropical locations: Rancho Alegre (RA); São Sebastião da Amoreira (SSA); and São Jerônimo da Serra (SJS), Parana state, Brazil. The climate of the RA and SSA locations was classified as Cfa with hot summers, whereas that of the SJS location was Cfb with temperate summers, which are located at 380, 650, and 835 m a.s.l., respectively. A completely randomized block design with four replications and four trees per plot was used as a statistical model for each location. The soluble solids (SS) content, titratable acidity (TA), and the maturation index (MI) or ratio (SS/TA) of the juice, as well as the citrus color index (CCI) of fruit skin, were assessed monthly, beginning 200 days after flowering until harvest, totaling seven sampling dates. The data sets of each location were analyzed independently through a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) involving rootstocks in a split plot array in time (days) to allow for the assessment of the significance of the main effects, complemented by regression analysis. In general, the ripening of ‘Valencia’ orange fruits was influenced by the different ‘Trifoliata’ hybrid rootstocks. At the RA location, trees on IPEACS-256 and’ US-852’ citrandarins had the highest SS, and on ‘US-852’ citrandarin had the highest MI, reaching the MIim earlier than the other rootstocks. The highest CCI was achieved when trees were on IPEACS-256 citrandarin. At the SSA location, trees on ‘US-852’, IPEACS-256, and IPEACS-264 citrandarins had the highest SS, but on ‘US–852’ had the highest MI, reaching the earliest MIim among the rootstocks. The highest CCI was achieved when trees were on ‘US-852’ and IPEACS-256 citrandarins. In the SSJ location, there was no significant effect of the rootstocks on and of the variables of ‘Valencia’ orange fruit. This assessment can be useful in the planning of new orchards producing high-quality fruit with desirable features for the orange juice industry.",

By appealing to the idea of Lakatos research programs, it shows possible ways of NCR’s development and projects its possible futures. The article proceeds in three parts. The first one juxtaposes literature concerning Lakatos’s notion of scientific progress in IR with the philosopher himself and consequently shows how trying to operationalize his methodology in social science is not the way to go. The paper refers to both Elmans’ (2002, 2003) and Schweller’s (2003) proposals, pointing out that the first attempt at a detailed operationalization of Lakatos’s idea is not possible in social sciences, and that the second, relying on a commonsense approach, also proved insufficient to apply Lakatos’s criteria in practice. The second part of the article identifies the theoretical contents of NCR: hard core as well as its positive and negative heuristic, whereas the third one presents how Lakatos’s philosophy inspired the authors to develop three metaphors – weathered tree, graft, and seedling – that help to convey something about the present version of NCR and its possible futures. Conclusions draw the readers’ attention to the question whether and which of the presented metaphors shows the progressive promise of NCR’s progress as understood in Lakatos’ terms.",

Grafting rootstock types of the apple tree can affect phenotypes in cultivation practice, but it is not clear whether grafting rootstock types can affect the composition and diversity of root microbial community and the resistance of apple tree to apple Valsa canker.<h4>Methods</h4>To explore root microbial differences and the correlation, 16S rRNA and ITS genes were sequenced using Novaseq technology.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that the influence of grafting rootstock types on the composition of the root fungal community was greater than that of bacteria. And the bacterial community richness was higher in the healthy (OTUs: 1693) and dwarfing rootstock (OTUs: 1526) than in the disease (OTUs: 1181) and standard rootstock (OTUs: 1412), while the fungal community richness was the opposite. Moreover, the bacterial abundance of root zone, rhizosphere, and root endophytic microorganisms with the same grafting rootstock type exhibited a decreasing trend. Results of Nested PCR assay on soil and root tissue of Valsa mali showed that the content of V. mali in dwarfing rootstocks are lower than standard rootstocks. These results suggest that apple trees grafting with dwarfing rootstocks are more resistant to V. mali than standard rootstocks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Under different grafting types, the effect on the composition of fungal community in apple tree root was greater than that of bacteria. The bacterial community in dwarfing rootstocks is more abundant and diverse, including more beneficial microorganisms. Therefore, dwarfing rootstock is more conducive to the resistance to apple Valsa canker from biological control.",

      "abstract": "Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating disease of citrus that is found in most citrus production areas around the world. The bacterium associated with HLB resides in and damages the phloem, restricting the movement of photosynthates throughout the plant and leading to tree decline. Considerable root loss can be observed in affected trees even when few disease symptoms are visible aboveground. Root traits can substantially influence tree performance and use of superior rootstocks is one strategy to manage tree health and reduce production losses in a disease-endemic environment. Citrus rootstocks are typically propagated by seed, but due to the increased demand for some of the best-performing cultivars, propagation by other methods is being used to overcome seed shortages. In this research, differences in root architecture and root growth of six different rootstocks propagated by seed, cuttings, and tissue culture, and their influence on the grafted ‘Valencia’ ( Citrus sinensis ) scion were investigated. A field trial was established in southwest Florida in 2017. Trees were evaluated for their performance during the first 2 years after planting and a subset of trees was excavated for detailed analysis of root architectures and biomass distribution. Significant differences among propagation methods were found for the rootstock trunk diameter and the lateral (structural) root length, which were largest in seed-propagated rootstocks. Most of the other horticultural and root architectural traits were not significantly influenced by the rootstock-propagation method; however, many of the measured variables were significantly influenced by the rootstock cultivar regardless of the propagation method. The results showed that rootstocks propagated by cuttings and tissue culture were similar to seed-propagated rootstocks in their influence on the grafted tree during the early years of growth in the field.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Severe climate alterations that seriously challenge fruit production, combined with the demand for healthy, pesticide-free fruits, continuously direct rootstock/cultivar selection towards high adaptable varieties breeding. This study aimed to investigate the rootstocks’ influence on the performance of grafted ‘Summit’ cherry trees, including potentially dwarfing Prunus cerasus , Prunus fruticosa and Prunus mahaleb rootstock candidates. Anatomical properties of rootstock and scion stems were investigated to determine variation among different rootstocks and scion-rootstock combinations and to establish the link between trunk hydraulic conductivity, effective tree crown volume and yielding potential. Cross-section anatomical characteristics varied significantly both in rootstock and scion stems, indicating a clear influence of rootstock genotype on grafted sweet cherry trees. It was observed that all investigated cherry rootstock candidates belong to the low-vigorous rootstocks, based on the estimated effective crown volume of grafted trees compared to ‘Gisela 5’, with values ranging from 0.86 to 2.97 m 3 in the fifth year after planting. Results showed a statistically significant positive correlation between trunk hydraulic conductivity, effective tree crown volume and yielding potential, with correlation coefficients up to 0.96. Significantly higher effective crown volume and trunk hydraulic conductance of trees grafted on P. cerasus compared to the trees on control, as well as highest yielding potential, showed better adaptation of these rootstock candidates in the trial without irrigation implemented. It was found that PC_05_04 rootstock candidate could be considered as the most appropriate choice when raising the high-density sweet cherry plantations, due to assessed parameters of vegetative and generative growth.",

      "abstract": "Apple trees grafted on different rootstock types, including vigorous rootstock (VR), dwarfing interstock (DIR), and dwarfing self-rootstock (DSR), are widely planted in production, but the molecular determinants of tree branch architecture growth regulation induced by rootstocks are still not well known. In this study, the branch growth phenotypes of three combinations of 'Fuji' apple trees grafted on different rootstocks (VR: Malus baccata; DIR: Malus baccata/T337; DSR: T337) were investigated. The VR trees presented the biggest branch architecture. The results showed that the sugar content, sugar metabolism-related enzyme activities, and hormone content all presented obvious differences in the tender leaves and buds of apple trees grafted on these rootstocks. Transcriptomic profiles of the tender leaves adjacent to the top buds allowed us to identify genes that were potentially involved in signaling pathways that mediate the regulatory mechanisms underlying growth differences. In total, 3610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through pairwise comparisons. The screened data suggested that sugar metabolism-related genes and complex hormone regulatory networks involved the auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CK), abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) pathways, as well as several transcription factors, participated in the complicated growth induction process. Overall, this study provides a framework for analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying differential tree branch growth of apple trees grafted on different rootstocks.",

Lemon juice aroma-active compounds were profiled in this study using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-olfactometry, and other metabolites contributing to overall flavor quality were investigated. Lemon juice from different rootstocks was discriminated using the metabolic profile. Flavor and other lemon juice metabolites also distinguished symptomatic from asymptomatic trees. Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that biosynthesis pathways of the Phosphotransferase system (PTS), and Starch and sucrose metabolism involving fructose, glucose and sucrose, were highly influenced by HLB status. This study provides the first comprehensive view of lemon juice metabolites, including alterations resulting from rootstock differences or disease severity.",

The rubber yield per ha, produced by trees grafted on heterogeneous illegitimate seedling rootstocks, has reached its maximum. For long-standing Hevea clones, as for a lot of other tree species, one of the consequences of physiological aging is reduced <i>in vitro</i> growth and the lack of a proper geotropic (tap) root system. Somatic embryogenesis on young inner seed integument or stamen filaments provides a mean to regain ontogenetic juvenility. The process is limited by irregular germination of the somatic embryos. Nevertheless, with the obtained <i>in vitro</i> plants, juvenile lines have been established of the most important profitable rubber tree clones. Currently they are micropropagated on a commercial scale. Moreover, the produced plants can serve as mother plants for propagation by means of macro-cutting. Somatic embryogenesis enables the production of transgenic <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i> as well. Genes conferring plant disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and production of foreign proteins in the lactiferous vessels will further shape the rubber tree of the future.",

Aboveground parts of young pear trees grafted on P. betulifolia grew more vigorously than that on dwarfing rootstocks. Therefore, the remobilization of storage N within young pear trees on vigorous rootstocks may be different from that on dwarfing rootstocks. A 15N tracing experiment, including six groups of one-year-old pear trees grafted on vigorous rootstocks in 2016, was conducted to investigate the mobilization of storage N from 2016 to 2018. Results indicated that about 44%, 31.4% and 24.6% of storage N remobilized in new growth was derived from the trunk, shoots and roots, respectively. Most of storage N remobilized in new organs were supplied by trunks and shoots. About 82.2% of storage N withdrawn from senescent leaves were recovered in the trunk and shoots during autumn. The aboveground parts played a more important role than roots in the cycling process of storage N in young pear trees. However, as compared with young pear trees on dwarfing rootstocks, more storage N recovered in new organs were supplied by roots of that on vigorous rootstocks, due to vigorous growth and more nutrient requirement of aboveground parts.",

Despite the abundant research on fire blight, information about <i>E. amylovora</i> population dynamics and survival in fire blight cankers and the plant defense responses to this pathogen in the infected bark are limited. In our study, we obtained fire blight cankers in apple, pear, and Asian pear cultivars showing differing resistance to the disease by shoot inoculation with <i>E. amylovora</i>. We collected cankers from irrigated and non-irrigated trees every 3 months in two independent field experiments and analyzed samples by viability digital PCR. We also assessed the expression of pathogenicity-related (<i>PR</i>) genes in the bark of selected apple and Asian pear cultivars. A logistic regression analysis revealed the impact of environmental and host factors on <i>E. amylovora</i> detection rates in cankers. The chances of detecting live <i>E. amylovora</i> cells in cankers increased significantly in those collected from irrigated trees, in July, and/or during an experiment performed in a year with an expected average rainfall when compared to samples from non-irrigated trees, collected in January, and/or during an experiment performed under environmental conditions dominated by drought. We found a positive correlation between the pathogen detection rates in cankers and the host resistance to fire blight that might be explained by lower <i>E. amylovora</i> survival rates in more damaged tissues of susceptible hosts. The genes <i>PR-1, PR-2, PR-5,</i> and <i>PR-8</i> were induced in the bark surrounding apple and Asian pear fire blight cankers. Our study, involving the analysis of more than 800 canker samples, provides new knowledge about the fire blight disease cycle and lays the foundation for improved fire blight management and eradication strategies in pome fruit orchards.",

In addition, information about doses, fertilizer sources, methods of application, and particularly, differential nutrient demand of scion/rootstock combinations are required for efficient fertilization of commercial groves. In a non-irrigated sweet orange orchard (cv. Natal), grafted onto Rangpur lime, Swingle citrumelo or Sunki mandarin, we studied the application of two sources of B: boric acid (17% B, soluble in water) and ulexite (12% B, partially soluble in water) at four levels of supply (control without B, and soil application of 2, 4 and 6 kg ha−1 yr−1 of B). The experiment was carried out for three years (2004–2006). Boron availability in the soil and concentration in the leaves, as well as the fruit yield and quality of trees were evaluated. Soil B extracted with hot water and total leaf B positively correlated with doses of the nutrient applied to the trees. Levels of B in the soil and in the leaves did not vary with fertilizer sources. Fruit yield of trees grafted onto Rangpur lime and Swingle citrumelo was more responsive to B doses than those grafted onto Sunki mandarin. The maximum fruit yield of trees grafted onto Swingle was obtained with 3.2 kg ha−1 yr−1 of B, and leaf B level of 280 mg kg−1 that point out to a highest demand for B when this combination was compared with other rootstocks. Furthermore, fertilization with B did not affect the quality of fruits, but correlated with B and potassium (K) concentrations in the leaves. These results also support that the current recommendations for levels of B in leaves should be revisited.",

It was investigated the combination of cultivars ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Jonagold’, grafted onto the MM-106 stock in three terms: by budding in August (control); table grafting with a two-eyed cutting in February; grafting by bud and cuttings in March. The aim of the research was to identify the most effective and technologically methods of grafting for apple-tree. We have noted the influence of these methods on the growth, development of plants under the field conditions and the yield of planting material. The most effective was the method of grafting in common use time. The survival rate of eyes in this variant varied from 92 to 98%. On average, over three years it was 96,7%. The yield of standard annual seedlings was 62.3 thous. pcs. per ha. In applying of grafting in winter, the survival rate of copulants was quite high (85,5%). However, the yield of the standard was significantly lower than in the control variant and did not exceed 50,0%. The use of early spring grafting by eye and cuttings was less effective. The yield of the standard varied from 24,7 to 38,2 thous. pcs. per ha. Therefore, the cultivation of apple planting material by the method of summer budding and winter grafting are the main and most effective ones. Spring grafting is less cost effective but can be used as a complementary method.",

Each type of container was filled with two different growing substrates: coconut fiber and sawdust. Results showed that large size root trainers (1000 cc) have the highest percentage of graft success (96.67%). Rootstocks 45 days old presented the highest percentage of graft success in nursery (94.31%). The longest scions (12 cm) presented the minimum sprouting time (18.21 days). In the field, survival rate 100% of the grafted plants was recorded. In addition to the high survival rate ensured in field, root trainer is eco-friendly reusable and it light nature can prove a profitable technology for raising cashew elite plants regeneration.",

Sequencing results showed that: (i) CEVd contained the P L and P R characteristic of class A variants; (ii) HSVd was a noncachexia variant; (iii) CBLVd was related to CVd-Ia variants; (iv) CDVd was a mixture of two types (CVd-IIIa and CVd-IIIb) of variants. The presence of the same type of variants in inoculated clementine (Citrus clementina ‘Nules’) and sweet orange (C. sinensis ‘Navelina’) trees on Carrizo citrange (Poncirus trifoliata × C. sinensis) rootstocks was confirmed. The effect of infection was determined by assessing the performance of infected and noninfected trees growing in the field. Infection resulted in small trees with reduced canopy, yielding a reduced crop. Fruit characteristics were also affected: (i) clementine and sweet orange fruits from infected trees were larger than those from noninfected trees; (ii) clementine fruits from infected trees differed in shape from those of noninfected trees; (iii) sweet orange fruits from infected trees had maturity indexes and juice contents higher than those from noninfected trees; (iv) in both species, the density of the juice, the amount of soluble solids, and the acidity of the fruits from infected trees were lower than those of fruits from noninfected trees. Infected trees had a poorly developed root system with fibrous roots containing fewer amyloplasts than noninfected trees. The results of an in vitro assay on the induction and development of roots in cultured explants are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The contribution of N remobilization to the seasonal growth of field-grown Malus domestica (apple) trees was measured using two different techniques. 'Fuji' trees grafted on M.9 apple rootstocks were planted in the field and fertilized and irrigated for two growing seasons. During the second year, the trees received 15N-labelled fertilizer and destructive harvests were taken during the spring and summer to determine the pattern of N remobilization and uptake. At the same time, patterns of N translocation in the xylem were measured by sampling saps at each harvest and analysing them for their constituent amino acids and amides. Total water flux through the trunk xylem was also measured throughout the sampling period using the heat balance technique. The flux of amino compounds in the xylem was then calculated to see if this approach could quantify remobilization. Most of the N for leaf growth was provided by remobilization, which lasted for some 40 d following bud-burst. The labelled N was not taken up until 14 d after remobilization had started. The predominant amino compounds recovered in the xylem were Asn, Asp, Arg, and Gln, whose concentration peaked during remobilization, except for Arg whose concentration was highest at bud-break and declined thereafter. The amount of N translocated in the xylem as Asn, Asp and Gln correlated well with the amount of N remobilized (as measured by the recovery of unlabelled N in the new above-ground growth). The data suggest that Arg is translocated predominantly as a consequence of root uptake and they are discussed in relation to measuring N remobilization in field-grown trees.",

Because citrus rootstocks respond differently to B supply, we hypothesised that PM H + ‐ATPase activity of varieties contrasting in horticultural traits would affect nutrient uptake by trees. Sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ) trees grafted onto Rangpur lime (RL; Citrus limonia ) or Swingle citrumelo (SW; Citrus paradisi × Poncirus trifoliata ) were grown in nutrition solution with four B concentrations (0 [control concentration], 46, 230 and 460 μM B, as H 3 BO 3 ) up to 7 days of treatment imposition after plant adaptation into the hydroponic condition. SW exhibited higher B absorption, leaf B and enzyme activity than RL. The highest enzyme activity was achieved with 230 μM of B 1 day after treatment imposition (ATI), whereas B excess impaired the PM H + ‐ATPase in all periods evaluated. Absorption of mineral nutrients correlated with PM H + ‐ATPase activity, with greater nutrient uptake per root unit in SW compared to RL. Leaf and root nutrient concentrations were equivalent to amounts absorbed and enzyme activity, with greater increments exhibited by trees grafted onto SW compared to RL. Effects of B supply on PM H + ‐ATPase activity explain distinct nutrient uptake patterns by trees, what supports fine‐tuning fertilisation guidelines of citrus taking into account rootstock varieties.",

      "abstract": "The field performance of ‘Fuyu’ and ‘Hiratanenashi’ Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) trees grafted onto rootstocks propagated from cuttings of root suckers of dwarfed trees (R-a and R-b) was investigated over seven years. The results were then compared with the performance of trees grafted onto seedling stocks (S) as well as that of micropropagated and own-rooted trees (O-R). Shoot growth of both cultivars on R-b was less vigorous than that on R-a, while tree height of ‘Hiratanenashi’ on R-a was the same as that of both S and O-R. Secondary shoots on R-b trees were scarce in both cultivars in the fifth and sixth years. On R-b, both cultivars bore flowers soon after field establishment and thereafter continued to do so abundantly, with the percentage of flower-bearing shoots on R-b trees being the highest for each study year. Yield efficiencies calculated by units of trunk cross-sectional area, canopy area, and canopy volume showed that R-b trees produced fruit most effectively, although the total yields during the three harvest years were not significantly different between rootstocks. The appearance of the graft union with R-b varied depending on the scion cultivar, but no union was damaged by the occurrence of several typhoons, which uprooted a number of trees. These results show the possibility of using R-b propagated by cutting as a dwarfing rootstock for persimmon trees. Overall, the R-b rootstock improved yield efficiency, although fruit quality requires further investigation because it is thought to be affected by rootstock type.",

The orchard was located on a calcareous clay-loam soil, which was level-basin irrigated. While no trees of CAB 6P, 'Colt', 'Damil', MM 9, and MaxMa 97 rootstocks died, most of the trees on 'Inmil' and 'Camil' did die. 'Damil' proved to be the most dwarfing and low-yielding rootstock, whilst 'Colt', MM 9 and CAB 6P were the most invigorating rootstocks, although differences with CAB 11E and SL 64 by the ninth year after planting were not significant. An intermediate level of vigour, shown on MaxMa rootstocks, could indicate a semi-dwarfing potential for these selections. In general, P. cerasus rootstocks (CAB 6P, CAB 11E and MM 9) promoted greater cumulative yields and better yield efficiency than the other rootstocks. Leaf mineral analysis of trees showed element concentrations close to the optimum for the trees grafted on P. cerasus rootstocks, and they were better than for trees on 'Damil' and 'Colt'. Leaf chlorophyll concentration, estimated by SPAD readings, was also generally higher for the trees on P. cerasus rootstocks. According to our results, the P. cerasus selections seem to be the best adapted rootstocks for cherry cultivars in heavy and calcareous soil conditions, under flood irrigation. However, they had the highest number of root suckers. The growing conditions were not favourable for the cherry rootstocks 'Camil', 'Damil' and 'Inmil'.",

We intend to identify wild olive genotypes with optimal adaptability to different environmental conditions to serve as a source of rootstocks and resistance genes for olive breeding. The SILVOLIVE collection includes 146 wild genotypes representative of the six <i>O. europaea</i> subspecies and early-generations hybrids. These genotypes came either from olive germplasm collections or from direct prospection in Spain, continental Africa and the Macaronesian archipelago. The collection was genotyped with plastid and nuclear markers, confirming the origin of the genotypes and their high genetic variability. Morphological and architectural parameters were quantified in 103 genotypes allowing the identification of three major groups of correlative traits including vigor, branching habits and the belowground-to-aboveground ratio. The occurrence of strong phenotypic variability in these traits within the germplasm collection has been shown. Furthermore, wild olive relatives are of great significance to be used as rootstocks for olive cultivation. Thus, as a proof of concept, different wild genotypes used as rootstocks were shown to regulate vigor parameters of the grafted cultivar \"Picual\" scion, which could improve the productivity of high-density hedgerow orchards.",

Rootstocks greatly influence variety behaviour as it ensures tolerance to abiotic stress conditions, as well as the provision of minerals and water for the total plant, and consequently impact crop yield and fruit quality. So, rootstock choice is one of the most important decisions a grower makes when establishing commercial citrus orchards. In this chapter, we attempted to provide an overview of the response in terms of plant growth, fruit quality and yield parameters of several citrus cultivar trees grafted onto different commercial rootstocks, plus new hybrids and some dwarfing genotypes, to reduce costs in some cultural practices. In particular, we considered the rootstock influence on scion photosynthetic capacity linked to carbohydrate distribution for plant vegetative and reproductive development.",

Hydraulic conductance of leaves, stems, trunk, graft union, and root system was measured in the scion/rootstocks with a high-pressure flow meter. Total leaf area and dry-matter partitioning into main tree components were also determined. The above and below ground portions of trees grown on Nemaguard rootstock were 393% and 299% larger, respectively, than trees grown on K-146-44 rootstock. Whether trees were grafted on Nemaguard or K-146-44, the root system accounted for most of the resistance to water flow through the tree. When hydraulic conductance was expressed per unit leaf area, trees on K-146-44 rootstock had significantly lower root conductance than trees on Nemaguard rootstock. Rootstocks had no effect on hydraulic conductance through the scion or the graft union. Trees on K-146-44 also partitioned relatively more dry matter to roots and leaves and less to stems than trees on Nemaguard. The results suggest that high root resistance plays a central role in the dwarfing mechanism induced by the size-controlling rootstock.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we assessed the drought tolerance of 1-year-old apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) trees exposed to extreme water stress, focusing on growth and physiological responses. After grafting 'Fuji' variety onto M26 and M9 rootstocks or Cornell-Geneva rootstocks (G11, G202, G214, G935, CG4814, and CG5087), the grafted plants were planted in 17-L pots and managed in a greenhouse. After irrigation was stopped, soil water potential dropped to about –700 hPa in 12 days. The leaf water potential and tree vertical growth rate of drought-stressed trees decreased dramatically, and the decreased growth rate of the G202, G935, and M26 trees, which generally produced a large leaf area, was considerable. Trunk cross-sectional area and leaf area of all trees under drought stress were reduced by almost 50% or more than 60%, respectively. Drought-stressed trees were subjected to control-level irrigation during the recovery of about 11 days, but their leaf water potential still did not fully recover to the control level. Photosynthesis-related parameters also showed a substantial decrease as the soil water potential changed, but the difference among trees was not noticeable. Fine root (<2 mm diameter) dry weight showed the greatest decrease in the CG5087 tree, whereas the G935 tree was insensitive. The root:shoot biomass ratio of the CG5087 and M26 trees was 0.24 and 0.23, respectively, and 0.38 for the G214 and CG4814 trees. The CG5087 tree was the most sensitive to drought stress, whereas drought tolerance was higher in the G202, G214, and G935 trees than in the M26 tree, which had a comparable drought tolerance to the G11, CG4814, and M9 trees.",

It is caused by pathovars within the <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> species complex including <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>morsprunorum</i> (Psm) race 1 (R1), Psm race 2 (R2) and <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>syringae</i> (Pss). Psm R1 and Psm R2 were originally designated as the same pathovar; however, phylogenetic analysis revealed them to be distantly related, falling into phylogroups 3 and 1, respectively. This study characterized the pathogenicity of 18 newly genome-sequenced <i>P. syringae</i> strains on cherry and plum, in the field and laboratory. The field experiment confirmed that the cherry cultivar Merton Glory exhibited a broad resistance to all clades. Psm R1 contained strains with differential specificity on cherry and plum. The ability of tractable laboratory-based assays to reproduce assessments on whole trees was examined. Good correlations were achieved with assays using cut shoots or leaves, although only the cut shoot assay was able to reliably discriminate cultivar differences seen in the field. Measuring bacterial multiplication in detached leaves differentiated pathogens from nonpathogens and was therefore suitable for routine testing. In cherry leaves, symptom appearance discriminated Psm races from nonpathogens, which triggered a hypersensitive reaction. Pathogenic strains of Pss rapidly induced disease lesions in all tissues and exhibited a more necrotrophic lifestyle than hemibiotrophic Psm. This in-depth study of pathogenic interactions, identification of host resistance and optimization of laboratory assays provides a framework for future genetic dissection of host-pathogen interactions in the canker disease.",

The trials, located in southern and central Sweden, were based on subsets of 201 open-pollinated families derived from plus trees grafted in seed orchards. Observations of height growth and phenology in the farm-field test were made during years 2-4, and trees in field trials were assessed for height and damage at 9-14 years of age. Narrrow-sense heritabilities for height-growth traits in the field trials varied from 0.05 to 0.47. Heritabilities in the farm-field test were approximately 0.80 for date of bud burst, 0.35 for leader lignification, and 0.20 for frequency of seedlings with free growth. Early bud burst and a high degree of free growth in the farm-field test were genetically correlated with lower height and higher frequency of ramicorns and frost damage in the field trials. Height in the farm-field test was poorly and inconsistently correlated with height in the field. Genetic correlations for final heights among the field trials were usually significant and in the range of 0.7 and above. Correlations did not decline with distance between trials, suggesting that local climate is more important than regional climatic zones when matching site and genotype.",

Root systems of 12 pairs of such trees were exposed to 1 m (3.3 ft) depth using an air excavation tool. In only one case was the fungus found in more than two cardinal directions of symptomatic trees based on isolation attempts from 192 root segments excised from 1.2 m (3.5 ft) lengths of primary roots extending in four cardinal directions from the root collar. Many (162) self grafts occurred in all oaks. Few (13) inter-tree grafts were found in less than one-third of the tree pairs. The fungus was isolated from the roots involved in two of thirteen inter-tree grafts and 14 of 62 self grafts assayed. The sporadic and unpredictable distribution of the fungus in roots of wilting red oaks supports current control approaches that assume the fungus is present in roots extending out in all directions once crown symptoms are evident. Additionally, self grafts may serve as a conduit for circumferential movement of the fungus around the main stem, but outside the root collar, through the interconnected roots.",

Fruit weight was increased by N fertilizer rate, but fruit production was not influenced appreciably by rate of N fertilizer, for the one year (1994) it was observed. Highest fruit quality was achieved with the lowest N fertilizer rate of 25 lbs.A‐1 (28.4 kg.ha‐1). Fruit quality was negatively related to N in leaves and fruit peel and cortex as well as leaf boron (B), fruit peel copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg) and fruit cortex Mg, and manganese (Mn) for both interstems. Lower rates of N fertilizer were related to lower concentrations of leaf and fruit N, \"redder\"; fruit skin color, greater fruit firmness and soluble solids concentration, higher fructose levels, and a lower incidence of bitter pit and scald than the higher rates of 100 or 150 lbs N A‐1 (113.6 or 170.5 kg N ha‐1).",

      "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Drought is a major environmental stress limiting plant growth, productivity, and survival worldwide. Rootstocks are widely used to enhance plants resistance to drought stresses. This study determined influence of rootstock on drought responses in 1‐year‐old ‘Gale Gala’ apple trees grafted onto Malus sieversii or M. hupehensis . RESULTS: Choice of rootstock resulted in differential response to drought stress. Specifically, M. sieversii caused less drought‐induced reduction in relative growth rate, biomass accumulation, leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content, relative water content, photosynthesis rate and maximum chlorophyll fluorescence yield but greater increase in whole‐plant water use efficiency compared to M. hupehensis . Secondly, compared with M. hupehensis, M. sieversii caused less drought‐induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species but more increase in activities of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, xylem sap abscisic acid concentration was greater in trees grafted onto M. hupehensis than in those grafted onto M. sieversii under drought stress. CONCLUSION: ‘Gale Gala’ trees' response to drought stress was associated with the rootstock's genotype onto which it was grafted. Trees with M. sieversii as rootstock are more drought resistant than trees with M. hupehensis as rootstock, which suggests that M. sieversii can be widely used as rootstock in arid and semi‐arid regions.

      "abstract": "Size-controlling rootstocks are required to attain trees with reduced stature that are necessary for modern orchard management, such as high density plantings. Apple cultivars can be grafted on commercially-available size-controlling rootstocks but new rootstocks are needed for both size-controlling efficacy and improved tolerance of abiotic and biotic stress. This research was designed to determine the consistency of Geneva and Malling rootstocks for size-control with scions of different growth potentials. Hydraulic conductivity (HC) and abscisic acid (ABA) in xylem exudates were measured in selected scions grafted to Malling (from least-to-most size control M.7, M.9, and M.27) and Geneva (from least-to-most size control, G.935, G.5087, G.41, and G.11) rootstocks. Regardless of scion vigor, trees with G.935 and G.41 rootstocks had the most height and diameter growth and the highest HC, whereas trees with M.27 rootstocks had the least. Lower ABA was measured in xylem exudate of 'Fuji' grown on G.935 and G.41 than G.5087 and G.11 rootstocks. Regardless of scion vigor, tree growth was less when grown on G.11 and G.5087, which were associated with less HC and elevated ABA in 'Fuji' scion. Tree heights of the scion were similar when grown on G.11, G.5087, and M.7. It is proposed that trees grafted to G.11 and G.5087 may be better adapted to dry environments based upon their size and elevated ABA.",

      "abstract": "This study was carried out in order to determine the effect of rootstocks (Gisela 5, Gisela 6, MaxMa 14 and SL 64) on performance of sweet cherry cultivar ‘0 900 Ziraat’ during 2010-2013 years. The trail in randomized block design was established as to factorial design. Each graft combination included 20 trees. The trees was trained as Spanish Bush training system. At the end of study, effect of rootstocks on vegetative growth was found significant. It has been determined that the trees grafted on SL 64 and MaxMa 14 rootstocks were more vigorous than the those grafted on Gisela 5 and Gisela 6. The rootstocks formed significant differences at the precocity. While the first blooming on the trees grafted on Gisela 5 and Gisela 6 rootstocks occurred at the second year after planting, the first blooming on the trees on MaxMa 14 and SL 64 rootstocks occurred at fourth year after planting. It has been determined that occur significant differences on yield per tree and yield efficiency among rootstocks. In terms of yield per tree and yield efficiency, While the lowest value was in SL 64 rootstock, the highest value was recorded in Gisela 5, and it has been determined that the differences between three rootstocks (Gisela 5, Gisela 6 and MaxMa 14) were not significant. While fruits weight varied according to the rootstock used in study, the trees grafted on Gisela 5 had the smallest fruit. Accompanied with differences between MaxMa 14 and SL 64 rootstocks were not significant, the biggest fruits were produced on trees grafted on SL 64 rootstock. As a result of the statistical analysis, it has determined that the rootstocks that used in trial did not create significant differences on soluble solids content (SSC) value. One of the most significant diagnosis was 6 % mortality rate that occurred on trees grafted Gisela 5 and Gisela 6 rootstocks.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to obtain high performance when computing matchings on parallel processors because matching algorithms explicitly or implicitly search for paths in the graph, and when these paths become long, there is little concurrency. In spite of this limitation, we present a new algorithm and its shared-memory parallelization that achieves good performance and scalability in computing maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. This algorithm searches for augmenting paths via specialized breadth-first searches (BFS) from multiple source vertices, hence creating more parallelism than single source algorithms. Algorithms that employ multiple-source searches cannot discard a search tree once no augmenting path is discovered from the tree, unlike algorithms that rely on single-source searches. We describe a novel tree-grafting method that eliminates most of the redundant edge traversals resulting from this property of multiple-source searches. We also employ the recent direction-optimizing BFS algorithm as a subroutine to discover augmenting paths faster. Our algorithm compares favorably with the current best algorithms in terms of the number of edges traversed, the average augmenting path length, and the number of iterations. Here, we provide a proof of correctness for our algorithm. Our NUMA-aware implementation is scalable to 80 threads of an Intel multiprocessor and to 240 threads on an Intel Knights Corner coprocessor. On average, our parallel algorithm runs an order of magnitude faster than the fastest algorithms available. The performance improvement is more significant on graphs with small matching number.",

      "abstract": "In cherry orchards, multi-functional nets represent very useful protection tools against biotic and abiotic stressors, such as Drosophila suzukii, rain, or hail. At the same time, the shading effect of the net can alter the microclimate within the canopy, thus affecting tree physiological processes. This work aims at testing the effect of “Keep in Touch®” multi-functional nets on water relations, leaf gas exchanges, and fruit growth of ‘Black Star’/cherry trees grafted on the semi-vigorous (‘CAB 6P’) and the semi-dwarfing (‘GiselaTM6’) rootstocks. Midday stem (Ψstem), leaf (Ψleaf), and fruit (Ψfruit) water potential, leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration, as well as seasonal fruit growth, were assessed in post-veraison, while productivity and fruit quality were determined at harvest. Results showed how nets did not diminish photosynthesis in the internal part of the canopy of trees grafted on ‘GiselaTM6’, while stem water potential decreased, thus improving their water status. On the contrary, nets induced a reduction of photosynthesis in the internal part of ‘CAB 6P’ trees, whose canopies were denser because of higher vigor of the combination. Similarly, fruit growth and quality on ‘CAB 6P’ trees were reduced under nets due to decreased fruit water potential, which caused these cherries to be weaker sinks for water and carbohydrates. Based on these results, we can conclude that “Keep in touch®” nets, besides their protective function against biotic stressors, can bring benefits to the high density planting systems, while they can induce some negative effects on fruit quality in highly vigorous orchards.",

      "abstract": "Brassinosteroid signaling downstream genes regulate many important agronomic traits in rice. However, information on such genes is limited in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and Rosaceae species. We identified these genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and nine Rosaceae species. They were, respectively, named based on chromosomal locations. Segmental duplication and whole-genome duplication under purifying selection, as determined by Ka/Ks analysis, likely contributed to Rosaceae gene expansion. Apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and rice genes were generally similar, while several Rosaceae genes differed from their rice homologs in various characteristics, such as gene length, subcellular localization, transmembrane topology, conserved domains, secondary structures, and responses to external signals. The brassinosteroid downstream genes in apple were, respectively, induced or repressed by five phytohormones. Furthermore, these apple downstream genes were differentially expressed in different apple grafting combinations (\"Nagafu No. 2\"/\"Malling 9\" and \"Nagafu No. 2\"/\"Nagafu No. 2\") and long-short shoot varieties (\"Yanfu No. 6\" and \"Nagafu No. 2\"). Responses of the <i>MdBZR</i> genes to diverse stress signals were examined and candidate hub genes were identified. These findings indicated that several brassinosteroid signaling downstream genes in Rosaceae functionally differed from their rice homologs, and certain apple genes may play roles in plant height and stress responses. This study provided valuable information and presented enriched biological theories on brassinosteroid signaling downstream genes in apple. Identification of such genes serve to help expand apple breeding and growth. This study provides useful information for brassinosteroid signaling downstream genes.",

      "abstract": "SummaryThe aim of the present research was to study intra-canopy variability in fruit growth under conditions of low fruit-to-fruit competition in peach trees grafted on rootstocks with differing size-controlling capacity. The experiment was conducted on adult peach trees of two cultivars, each grafted on five rootstocks. Tree canopies were divided vertically into five layers. The diameter of 12 fruit per canopy layer was measured early in the growing season and at harvest. At harvest, the fresh weight of each selected fruit was also determined. After harvest, thirty shoots per tree bearing the selected fruit were harvested, and several parameters related to local carbon source availability, competition between vegetative and reproductive organs, vigour of the fruiting shoot, and position of the fruit on the fruiting shoot were measured. The results demonstrated that fruit variability within peach trees is very large, even when fruit-to-fruit competition is low. Fruit size at harvest decreased significantly and progressively from the top layers to the bottom layers of the canopy. Fruit growth was positively correlated with specific leaf weight, leaf area, and vigour of the fruiting shoot, and was negatively correlated with the vigour of current-season shoot growth on the fruiting shoot. However, the relative importance of each parameter depended on the cultivar. Rootstock affected the relationship between fruit growth and the measured parameters, and some rootstocks appeared to limit the maximum potential fruit growth rate. The measured parameters did not explain all the intra-canopy variability in fruit growth, suggesting that other factors also played a role. Interestingly, fruit size within 1 month of full bloom increased progressively from the top to the bottom of the canopy.",

To explore the reasons for the etiolation of leaves of 'Hongmian miyou'/trifoliate orange, anatomical differences among different graft unions, gene expression profiles, and auxin levels of scion were investigated in this study. A histological assay indicated that there was no significant difference in anatomical structure between the compatible and incompatible combinations. A total of 1950 significant differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and analyzed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction were significantly enriched. Moreover, the expression of nine genes in the auxin pathway were upregulated and three were downregulated in compatible combinations compared with those in the incompatible group. Further experiments verified that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content increases in the compatible graft combination, which suggests that IAA might promote graft compatibility.",

After 5 years, participants grew more maize, chickens and types of crops and had higher DDS during growing months and, where demonstration gardens persisted, used more learned techniques and children ate more vitamin A-rich foods. Variables associated with DDS varied seasonally: during land preparation, higher DDS was associated with higher household durable asset-based wealth; during growing months, with greater diversity of vegetables planted and lower FIS; during harvest, with older caregivers, caregivers working less in agriculture, more diverse crops and receiving food from demonstration gardens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The intervention improved food production, food security and diets.

This will seem strange to some, as his epistemological anarchism is often taken to suggest that scientists should be free of even the most basic and obvious norms of science. His argument against the freedom of science is heavily influenced by his case study of the interference of Chinese communists in mainland China during the 1950s wherein the government forced local universities to continue researching traditional Chinese medicine rather than Western medicine. Feyerabend claims this move was justifiable and, eventually, vindicated by the resulting research which was beneficial for locals and the West at large. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis on Feyerabend's views on the freedom of science and his social commentary on US science funding policy that follows therefrom. This proves to be exceedingly difficult because Feyerabend's writings on the subject are filled with gaps, unnoticed tensions, and cognitive dissonance. Still, I think Feyerabend's scattered insights and the contradictions that emerge lead to an interesting microcosm of the issues contained in the freedom of science debate.",

      "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are used to analyze and visualize evolution. However, trees can be imperfect datatypes when summarizing multiple trees. This is especially problematic when accommodating for biological phenomena such as horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and hybridization, as well as topological conflict between datasets. Additionally, researchers may want to combine information from sets of trees that have partially overlapping taxon sets. To address the problem of analyzing sets of trees with conflicting relationships and partially overlapping taxon sets, we introduce methods for aligning, synthesizing and analyzing rooted phylogenetic trees within a graph, called a tree alignment graph (TAG). The TAG can be queried and analyzed to explore uncertainty and conflict. It can also be synthesized to construct trees, presenting an alternative to supertrees approaches. We demonstrate these methods with two empirical datasets. In order to explore uncertainty, we constructed a TAG of the bootstrap trees from the Angiosperm Tree of Life project. Analysis of the resulting graph demonstrates that areas of the dataset that are unresolved in majority-rule consensus tree analyses can be understood in more detail within the context of a graph structure, using measures incorporating node degree and adjacency support. As an exercise in synthesis (i.e., summarization of a TAG constructed from the alignment trees), we also construct a TAG consisting of the taxonomy and source trees from a recent comprehensive bird study. We synthesized this graph into a tree that can be reconstructed in a repeatable fashion and where the underlying source information can be updated. The methods presented here are tractable for large scale analyses and serve as a basis for an alternative to consensus tree and supertree methods. Furthermore, the exploration of these graphs can expose structures and patterns within the dataset that are otherwise difficult to observe.",

Meta-trees (Meta Supertrees) are suggested as a way to generate a phylogeny for groups where you have many different data sets of overlapping but not identical sets of taxa and without a common set of markers. Meta-trees graft phylogenies onto a fixed base tree and avoid the problems of missing or redundant data and misplaced taxa that plague other types of supertrees.",

      "abstract": "The strength of growth of 'Łutówka' trees was related to the soil quality and the rootstock. Measurements of the tree trunks and the crown size showed that on fertile soil the trees grafted on Mahaleb cherry grew worse, forming by 12% thinner trunks and by over 20% (significantly) smaller crowns as compared to Mazzard cherry trees. On poor sandy-loamy soil the crowns of trees grafted on Mahaleb were significantly, more than 40% bigger than those on Mazzard cherry. No significant differences in the yielding and productivity of trees grafted on Mahaleb and Mazzard cherry trees were found on grey brown podzolic soil. The experiment conducted on sandy-loamy soil pointed to significant differences in the yielding and productivity between 'Łutówka' trees grafted on the studied rootstocks. The trees grafted on Mahaleb cherry in both studied years were characterized by significantly greater productivity than on the other rootstocks. Significantly higher yields were gathered from the trees on Mahaleb cherry than on vegetative rootstocks, and by 70% higher than on Mazzard cherry. P-HL A rootstock is of little use in the planting of 'Łutówka', which grown poorly on light soils. Besides poor growth and yielding, in longer dry periods the studies found the appearance of chlorosis of magnesium on older leaves, and even wilting of the leaves.",

      "abstract": "To obtain insight into potential mechanisms underlying the influence of rootstock on fruit size, we performed a comparative analysis of 'Shatangju' mandarin grafted onto two rootstocks. The results demonstrated that trees grafted onto Canton lemon produced larger fruits through an enhancement of cell expansion in the ripening period. The difference in fruit size may be due to greater auxin levels in fruits from trees on Canton lemon, and different auxin levels may be produced by parent trees as the result of AUX1 upregulation. Rootstocks also modulate auxin signaling by affecting the transcription of several auxin response factor genes. There were higher abscisic acid concentrations in fruits of 'Shatangju'/Trifoliate orange, resulting in an inhibition of fruit growth and cell expansion through suppression of the synthesis of growth promoting hormones. Furthermore, expansins may be involved in the regulation of final fruit size by influencing cell expansion. Multiple pathways likely exist in citrus rootstocks that regulate fruit size.",

      "abstract": "The classical gene and species tree reconciliation, used to infer the history of gene gain and loss explaining the evolution of gene families, assumes an independent evolution for each family. While this assumption is reasonable for genes that are far apart in the genome, it is not appropriate for genes grouped into syntenic blocks, which are more plausibly the result of a concerted evolution. Here, we introduce the <i>Super-Reconciliation</i> problem which consists in inferring a history of segmental duplication and loss events (involving a set of neighboring genes) leading to a set of present-day syntenies from a single ancestral one. In other words, we extend the traditional Duplication-Loss reconciliation problem of a single gene tree, to a set of trees, accounting for segmental duplications and losses. Existency of a Super-Reconciliation depends on individual gene tree consistency. In addition, ignoring rearrangements implies that existency also depends on gene order consistency. We first show that the problem of reconstructing a most parsimonious Super-Reconciliation, if any, is NP-hard and give an exact exponential-time algorithm to solve it. Alternatively, we show that accounting for rearrangements in the evolutionary model, but still only minimizing segmental duplication and loss events, leads to an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We finally assess time efficiency of the former exponential time algorithm for the Duplication-Loss model on simulated datasets, and give a proof of concept on the opioid receptor genes.",

      "abstract": "The field performance of 'Taishuu' Japanese persimmon trees grafted onto clonally propagated rootstocks, 'MKR1' and FDR-1, was investigated over 10 years. These results were then compared with the performance of trees grafted onto seedling stocks (S) and own-rooted trees derived from micropropagation (O-R). 'Taishuu' scions on 'MKR1' and FDR-1 rootstocks grew well initially, but stopped growing taller at seven years after planting. Total shoot length and trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) increased annually in all trees, while the differences in these parameters between S or O-R trees and 'MKR1' or FDR-1 trees continued to increase year after year. The graft union of trees grafted onto 'MKR1' swelled, and FDR-1 rootstock overgrew the 'Taishuu' scion. Trees grafted onto both 'MKR1' and FDR-1 bore female and male flowers soon after planting, and the percentage of shoots with female flowers relative to total shoots in 'MKR1'- and FDR-1-grafted trees were higher than that in S and O-R trees each year. The numbers of shoots with male flowers varied from year to year in 'MKR1'- and FDR-1-grafted trees, but did not appear to increase yearly. 'MKR1'- and FDR-1-grafted trees almost completely inhibited secondary shoot occurrence in mid-June, and the percentages of dropped fruitlets between the middle of May and the end of July were almost always lower for 'MKR1'- and FDR-1-grafted trees than for S and O-R trees. Cumulative yield efficiencies according to TCSA, canopy area, and canopy volume showed that 'MKR1'- and FDR-1-grafted trees produced fruit most efficiently, although the total yields per tree were not significantly different between rootstocks. There were no significant differences in fruit quality between the rootstocks, except for the number of seeds. Concentric cracking and stylar-end cracking occurred in fruit of trees grafted onto 'MKR1' and FDR-1. However, the differences between the rootstock types were not large. The harvest date of 'MKR1' trees was significantly earlier than that of S and O-R trees. In conclusion, 'MKR1' and FDR-1 are both satisfactory dwarfing rootstocks for 'Taishuu', with high yield efficiency and inhibition of early fruit drop.",

      "abstract": "Seedling grafting could provide additional crop improvement strategies for cotton. However, there existed limited studies on interspecific grafting and approaches. Four different grafting approaches were developed and compared between lines representing three of the four cultivated cotton species G. hirsutum, G. barbadense and G. herbaceum. Grafting approaches of this study focused on the cotyledon node and cotyledon leaves retained on scions, rootstocks, without cotyledon node and cotyledon leaves on scions and rootstocks or halved cotyledon node and single cotyledon leaf on scions and rootstocks. Evaluations of the grafting approaches were made by comparing survival and growth rate during the second and fifth weeks after transplantation, respectively. The formation of any lateral shoots at the grafted sites were studied in two of four grafting approaches in the first and the second year during flowering stage. DNA alterations due to grafting were investigated using microsatellite markers. There were no statistically significant differences between grafts and their control in survival rate and locus specific DNA alteration. Growth rate and lateral shoot formation, on the other hand, were different among grafting types and grafts. We concluded that grafting without cotyledon node and cotyledon leaves on rootstocks, and with cotyledon node but without cotyledon leaves on scions were easy to perform and suitable for interspecific cotton grafting. Results suggested that grafting seedlings and allowing time to heal graft wounds prior to spring transplanting or double cropping is suitable for wheat-cotton intercropping to prevent late or early chilling damage associated with seed sowing or conventional transplanting of susceptible seedlings. Furthermore, the rapid and consistent wound healing in seedling grafts along with lateral shoot formation occurring in two of four grafting approaches make them a suitable approach to investigate possible genetic and epigenetic movement between scions and rootstocks, especially across species.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural diversification can enhance climate resilience, biodiversity conservation, and livelihood in global farming systems. Diverse agroforestry systems with cocoa have been shown to provide all these benefits, but the often-lower yields compared to monocultures limit agroforestry adoption by smallholder farmers. Cocoa yield is pollination-limited, and here, we quantified the effect of hand pollination in cocoa on fruit set, fruit abortion or cherelle wilt, pest and diseases, and number of mature fruits. Experiments were conducted in Bahia, Brazil, along a shade gradient from low [10–30%] to high [70–100%] canopy cover and with cocoa trees grafted with high-yielding varieties. We found on average 331% fruit set, and 300% mature fruit increase (i.e. ripe pods) per tree by enhancing pollination by hand as little as 10% of the flowers/tree, compared to the control (i.e. with only natural pollination). Fruit set, fruit losses, and mature fruit development linked to hand pollination was higher in low compared to highly shaded cocoa areas. We found 31% higher fruit set and 37% higher number of mature fruits in grafted than un-grafted trees. Further, when comparing efforts invested in hand pollination, minimum labor (∼5 min/tree to pollinate 10–30% of the flowers/tree) led to a 871% fruit set and a 750% mature fruit increase under low canopy cover, and intermediate labor (∼15 min/tree to pollinate 40–60% flowers/tree) to a 629% fruit set under high canopy cover. As ∼5–15 min/tree hand pollination can substantially enhance fruit set and number of mature fruits in low as well as high shade management, we recommend performing hand pollination particularly in agroforests under 40–50% canopy cover to create win-win opportunities for high productivity and climate resilience. Future research should focus on the wide range of agroforestry, tree grafting and innovation strategies in all major production regions to capture the long-term variability of hand pollination as a basis to scale-up hand pollination for sustainable cocoa production globally.",

Despite its good horticultural performance, search for disease tolerant rootstock varieties to improve yield and longevity of citrus groves has increased. The objective of this work was to evaluate yield efficiency of sweet oranges on different rootstocks fertilized with N, P, and potassium. Tree growth was affected by rootstock varieties; trees on 'Swingle' citrumelo [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. × C. paradisi Macf.] presented the smallest canopy (13.3 m³ in the fifth year after tree planting) compared to those on 'Rangpur lime' and 'Cleopatra' mandarin [C. reshni (Hayata) hort. ex Tanaka] grown on the same grove. Although it was observed an overall positive relationship between canopy volume and fruit yield (R² = 0.95**), yield efficiency (kg m-3) was affected by rootstocks, which demonstrated 'Rangpur lime' superiority in relation to Cleopatra. Growth of citrus trees younger than 5-yr-old might be improved by K fertilization rates greater than currently recommended in Brazil, in soils with low K and subjected to nutrient leaching losses.",

      "abstract": "AbstractTo increase yield and/or enhance resistance to diseases, grafting is often applied in agriculture and horticulture. Interspecific grafting could possibly be used in forestry as well to improve drought resistance, but our understanding of how the rootstock of a more drought-resistant species can affect the grafted plant is very limited. Reciprocal grafts of two poplar species, Populus cathayana Rehder (less drought-resistant, C) and Populus deltoides Bart. ex Marsh (more drought-resistant, D) were generated. Four grafting combinations (scion/rootstock: C/C, C/D, D/D and D/C) were subjected to well-watered and drought stress treatments. C/D and D/C had a higher diameter growth rate, leaf biomass, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi) and total non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) content than C/C and D/D in well-watered condition. However, drought caused greater differences between P. deltoides-rooted and P. cathayana-rooted grafting combinations, especially between C/D and D/C. The C/D grafting combination showed higher resistance to drought, as indicated by a higher stem growth rate, net photosynthetic rate, WUEi, leaf water potential, proline concentration and NSC concentration and maintenance of integrity of the leaf cellular ultrastructure under drought when compared with D/C. D/C exhibited severely damaged cell membranes, mitochondria and chloroplasts under drought. The scion genotype caused a strong effect on the root proline concentration: the P. cathayana scion increased the root proline concentration more than the P. deltoides scion (C/C vs D/C and C/D vs D/D) under water deficit. Our results demonstrated that mainly the rootstock was responsible for the drought resistance of grafting combinations. Grafting of the P. cathayana scion onto P. deltoides rootstock resulted in superior growth and biomass when compared with the other three combinations both in well-watered and drought stress conditions.",

In all cultivars, fruit from trees grafted on Nanking cherry contained more total phenolic compounds than did those on 'Juseito' or 'Nagano-yaseito'. However, there were wide variations in total phenolic contents among the cultivars ; being low in 'Saotome', 'Yahata-hakuho', and 'Chikuma' but high in 'Sanyo-suimitsu', 'Setouchi-hakuto', and 'Golden Peach'. 'Sanyo-suimitsu'/Japanese bush cherry combination had the highest total phenolic content, compared with the same cultivar grafted on Nanking cherry or 'Juseito'. The level of higher molecular fraction of phenolic compounds was positively correlated with the total phenolic concentration. In addition, phenolic contents, L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity and L-phenylalanine content in fruit of 'Sanyo-suimitsu' trees, grafted on 'Juseito' and Nanking cherry, were investigated during fruit growth. Although the seasonal trends of total and higher molecular phenolic contents in 'Sanyo-suimitsu' grafted on 'Juseito' and Nanking cherry were similar, they were higher in Nanking cherry throughout fruit development, especially during Stage 2. PAL activity was high during Stage 1 and the first half of Stage 2, followed by a decrease to undetectable levels by harvest. During the early growth stages, higher PAL activity and lower L-phenylalanine content were found in fruit from trees on Nanking cherry than 'Juseito'.",

Herein, we demonstrate the importance of integrating fossil and extant species for inferring patterns of lineage diversification that would otherwise be masked in analyses that examine only one source of evidence. We infer the phylogeny and macroevolutionary history of the Tetraodontiformes (triggerfishes, pufferfishes and allies), a group with one of the most extensive fossil records among fishes. Our analyses combine molecular and morphological data, based on an expanded matrix that adds newly coded fossil species and character states. Beyond confidently resolving the relationships and divergence times of tetraodontiforms, our diversification analyses detect a major mass-extinction event during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), followed by a marked increase in speciation rates. This pattern is consistently obtained when fossil and extant species are integrated, whereas examination of the fossil occurrences alone failed to detect major diversification changes during the PETM. When taking into account non-homogeneous models, our analyses also detect a rapid lineage diversification increase in one of the groups (tetraodontoids) during the middle Miocene, which is considered a key period in the evolution of reef fishes associated with trophic changes and ecological opportunity. In summary, our analyses show distinct diversification dynamics estimated from phylogenies and the fossil record, suggesting that different episodes shaped the evolution of tetraodontiforms during the Cenozoic.",

Transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool to study the transcriptomic profile of genotypes under stress conditions.

Stem cuttings from the grafting region were performed in transversal and longitudinal sections, and the secondary xylem was separated for tissue comparison. The pear trees showed good development on P.calleryana rootstock, and the anatomical sections showed that the vascular tissues were connected, which did not occur when the trees were grafted on C.sinensis, in which the grafts sprouted, but did not develop, and the vascular tissues did not connect. The quince trees showed good development on both rootstocks due to the good connection of the vascular tissues. The connection of vascular tissues is essential for the success of grafting. The evaluated species did not differ significantly as to their secondary xylem tissues. The incompatibility found between the pear trees and the C.sinensis rootstocks is not anatomical.",

This is the first record of such an effect for avocado. The severity and incidence of anthracnose was significantly lower on ‘Hass’ grafted to ‘Velvick’ Guatemalan seedling rootstock compared with the ‘Duke 6’ Mexican seedling rootstock. Differences in anthracnose susceptibility were related to significant differences in concentrations of antifungal dienes in the leaves and mineral nutrients in the leaves and fruits from trees grafted to different rootstocks. Leaf diene concentrations were up to 1.5 times higher in ‘Hass’ trees on the ‘Velvick’ than the ‘Duke 6’ rootstock. In ungrafted nursery stock trees, diene concentrations were around 3 times higher in ‘Velvick’ than ‘Duke 6’ leaves. The ‘Velvick’/‘Hass’ combination also had a significantly lower leaf N concentration, a significantly higher fruit flesh Mn concentration, and significantly lower and higher leaf N/Ca and Ca+Mg/K ratios, respectively. A significant correlation ( r = 0.82) between anthracnose severity and skin N/Ca ratio was also evident.",

      "abstract": "The slender spindle bush type system is commonly used for compact-sized trees, especially grafted on dwarfing rootstocks. It is difficult to apply this system to trees grafted on vigorous rootstocks by winter pruning. Such practices only cause the trees to repeat imbalanced vegetative-oriented growth every year. Therefore, in the current work summer pruning was applied to slender spindle bush type of early maturing peach trees grafted on vigorous rootstocks. Three trials were conducted: summer shoot thinning, shoot heading back trials in the field and a shoot heading back and shading trial in the pot experiment. Summer shoot thinning reduced tree growth and recovered proper balance between vegetative and reproductive growth. The following season such shoot thinning enhanced bud burst and initial growth of new shoots but the final tree growth was less in the summer-pruned trees compared with winter-pruned trees. The fruit matured earlier and soluble solids content was greater and titratable acidity was lower in the summer-pruned trees. The summer shoot heading back trial revealed that it regenerates shoots, although they bear fewer flower buds compared with winter-pruned trees. Such heading back is effective to keep alive shoots and buds near the trunk in slender spindle bush type systems. Summer shoot heading back and shading experiments in the pot showed that shading reduced the number of regenerated shoots and flower bud formation and delayed flower blooming in the following year. Thus summer shoot thinning and heading back are applicable to early maturing peach cultivars grafted on vigorous rootstocks to maintain the slender spindle bush type because thinning favors reducing tree vigor and light penetration near the trunk, and heading back keeps alive shoots and buds near the trunk which otherwise weaken or die back due to apical dominance and/or shading.",

At the end of flowering, there were no significant differences between the different rootstocks in the years 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004. In 2001, trees grafted on P. pumila reached the end of flowering 2 d before trees grafted on the other rootstocks. ‘Redhaven’ fruits ripened on the same day on trees grafted on the different rootstocks. The differences were only between years. The results showed that significantly less vigorous trees, according to their trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) and canopy volume, with the lowest yield, were observed on P. pumila rootstock. The rootstock P. pumila had a significant negative influence on fruit dimensions and mortality was 50%. Trees grafted on ‘GF 655/2’ rootstock produced significantly lower yields than those grafted on ‘GF 677’ or ‘Missour’ rootstocks. Only the ‘GF 655/2’ rootstock had root suckers. Trees grafted on ‘GF 677’ rootstock were significantly more vigorous than on the other rootstocks, and produced the highest yield with good fruit quality. The final canopy volumes of peach trees grafted on the different rootstocks were very different. The most vigorous trees were those grafted on ‘GF 677’ rootstock, where the final tree volume was 12.8 m3. Trees grafted on P. pumila and ‘GF 655/2’ had significantly lower TCSA values than on the other rootstocks.",

Sap flow rates were measured with steady-state, heat-balance stem gauges; daily water use was measured with an electronic balance; and instantaneous transpiration was measured with a diffusion porometer. Differences in the sap flow among the three rootstocks were observed by the third day of stress treatment. The cumulative sap flow over the 3-day stress period was higher for trees on seedling and M.7 EMLA rootstocks than for those on Mark. Cumulative sap flow was reduced on the second and third days of water stress compared to sap flow in the control. The diurnal peak of sap flow rate was flattened on the second and third days of stress compared to the pattern for the control and first day of stress treatment. In general, the trees on the standard rootstock (seedling) were least affected by the water stress; trees on the full dwarf rootstock (Mark) were the most affected. Good agreement between cumulative sap flow measurements and gravimetric measurements indicates that the steady-state, heat-balance method is practical and accurate.",

      "abstract": "In a study of the apple (Malus ×domestica Borkh.) canopy structure, 5-year-old 'Fuji' and 'Braeburn' trees grafted on a low-vigour rootstock (M9) were compared at both fruiting branch and shoot levels. Percentages of short ([Formula: see text]5 cm) shoots and short shoot leaf area were significantly higher on 'Braeburn' than on 'Fuji', (76.8% vs. 72.6% and 46.9% vs. 42.9% for 'Braeburn' and 'Fuji', respectively). This high percentage of short shoots as compared with literature data was probably due to the training method, which reduced vigour. At shoot level, the ratio between dry masses of axis and leaf, called the axialization index, was determined to compare short and long shoots. Axialization values were higher for 'Braeburn' than for 'Fuji'. Although overall and individual leaf area was greater on long shoots, long shoot axialization (0.64 and 0.54 for 'Braeburn' and 'Fuji', respectively) was approximately twice that of short shoots (0.36 and 0.24, respectively). Therefore, for short shoots, the reduced carbon investment in supporting tissues may explain the significant role short shoots played in supporting early fruit development. For long shoots, the longer time required to reach the autotrophic and then exporting stage as well as the detrimental effect of early extension shoot development on fruit set might be explained by greater axialization.Key words: long shoot, short shoot, axialization index, apple, Malus ×domestica, biomass partitioning.",

O experimento foi desenvolvido em Votuporanga/SP e as enxertias foram feitas em porta-enxertos com 10 meses utilizando borbulhas do clone RRIM 600 em 31/1/14 e pela mesma pessoa. Os cortes dos porta-enxertos foram realizados dois dias antes de cada ciclo lunar (22/9/14 - nova; 29/9/14 - crescente; 06/10/14 - cheia e 13/10/14 - minguante). Após 40 dias dos cortes avaliou-se: o diâmetro do porta-enxerto; a porcentagem, o diâmetro, a altura e a massa seca da brotação. Concluiu-se que na região de Votuporanga/SP não há interferência das fases da lua na brotação do enxerto de seringueira e que o corte do porta-enxerto realizado nas fases da lua cheia e minguante (dois dias antes da entrada) origina brotações do enxerto de seringueira com maiores alturas e massa seca.",

      "abstract": "Developmental competence is the ability to differentiate in response to an appropriate stimulus, as first elaborated by Waddington in relation to organs and tissues. Competence thresholds operate at all levels of biological systems from the molecular (e.g. the cell cycle) to the ontological (e.g. metamorphosis and reproduction). Reproductive competence, an organismal process, is well studied in mammals (sexual maturity) and plants (vegetative phase change), though far less than later stages of terminal differentiation. The phenomenon has also been documented in multiple species of multicellular fungi, mostly in early, disparate literature, providing a clear example of physiological differentiation in the absence of morphological change. This review brings together data on reproductive competence in Ascomycete fungi, particularly the model filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, contrasting mechanisms within Unikonts and plants. We posit reproductive competence is an elementary logic module necessary for coordinated development of multicellular organisms or functional units. This includes unitary multicellular life as well as colonial species both unicellular and multicellular (e.g. social insects such as ants). We discuss adaptive hypotheses for developmental and reproductive competence systems and suggest experimental work to address the evolutionary origins, generality and genetic basis of competence in the fungal kingdom.",

All of them were grafted on new Mahaleb rootstocks obtained through softwood cuttings selected from a population of German seedlings of ‘Alpruma’ type in comparison with Mazzard seedling. Additionally an analysis of genetic variability of newly studied biotypes of Mahaleb was conducted. The biggest trunk cross-sectional area had trees on seedlings of Mazzard and Mahaleb No.1, No.4 and No.5, and the smallest on Mahaleb No. 2, No. 3 and No. 6. The biggest volume of the crown had trees growing on Mazzard and the smallest on Mahaleb No. 2 and No. 6. Bigger crowns were also created by the trees of ‘Burlat’ and ‘Summit’ cultivars, and smaller ‘Regina’ and ‘Vanda’. Trees budded on Mazzard had fruits which were slightly lighter in comparison to Mahaleb rootstocks. Regina and Summit outstood other cultivars in terms of weight of fruits. The biggest sum of crops was obtained from trees budded on Mahaleb No. 6 and No. 2, and the smallest on Mazzard and Mahaleb No. 1 and No. 4. The most productive were ‘Vanda’ and ‘Summit’. The biggest productivity index was obtained for rootstocks of Mahaleb No. 6, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 5. For Mazzard and and Mahaleb No. 1 the value of this index was the smallest. Of all examined cultivars the best results was Vanda, then Summit. The analysis of electrophoretic profiles conducted with PCR-RAPD method showed a big genetic similarity between Mahaleb No. 2 and No. 6 and a big variability of the remaining biotypes of Mahaleb among each other. Out of six examined biotypes, Mahaleb No. 2 and No. 6 turned out to be the most productively valuable.

      "abstract": "The ‘Queen’ orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.] is highly adaptable to the climatic conditions of the Southwest of Iran. However, the success of its production is highly dependent on its compatibility with rootstocks. This paper describes fruit production and quality of 10-year-old ‘Queen’ orange grafted on six commercial rootstocks in a five year period. ‘Queen’ orange trees grafted on ‘Volkamer’ lemon (Citrus volkameriana Ten. and Pasq.) (VL) produced the highest cumulative fruit yields, whereas trees on ‘‘Swingle’’ citromelo [(Citrus paradisi (L.) × Ponicrus trifoliate (L.) Raf.] (SC) and ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort. Ex Tan.) (Cleo) produced the least yield. The response of grafted trees in term of fruit production was intermediate on ‘‘Carrizo’’ citrange [(Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.× Ponicrus trifoliate (L.) Raf. ] (CC), ‘Troyer’ citrange [(Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.× Ponicrus trifoliate (L.) Raf. ] (TC), and Sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) (SO). Trees grafted on VL produced larger canopy volume than trees on the other rootstocks (32.48 m 3 ), while Cleo had the lowest tree canopy volume (18.87 m 3 ). Trees grafted on VL and CC produced the largest fruits, whereas the smallest fruits were obtained from trees grafted on Cleo and TC. Fruit rind thickness and acid content were not significantly affected by rootstocks. Fruit from trees grafted on VL had the highest juice content (43.52%), whereas fruits from trees on Cleo produced the lowest juice content (40.70%). Fruit from trees on SO had the highest soluble solids (13.50%), while those from trees on VL were the lowest (12.08%).The study revealed that the rootstocks have significant effects on most of the measured parameters, indicating that tree size, yield, and fruit quality of ‘Queen’ orange can be controlled by proper selection of rootstock. This study showed that VL is a good rootstock for ‘Queen’ orange grafting.",

      "abstract": "Changes in the amount, chemical composition and morphology of epicuticular wax in relation to rindstaining and peel pitting of Fortune mandarin fruits from trees grafted on different rootstocks and growing in different locations in the citrus area of Valencia (Spain) were studied. The epicuticular wax amount was higher on fruits from the north quadrant of the tree and was more influenced by the orchard location than by the tree rootstock. The main constituent classes of the epicuticular wax were alkanes > esters > ketones > aldehydes > fatty acids > primary alcohols > triterpenes. In the north quadrant of the tree the alkane and ester content in the wax of fruits from an orchard with fruits not rindstained in recent years was higher and the ketone and fatty acid content was lower than in fruits from an orchard with fruits rindstained in recent years. The epicuticular wax of Fortune mandarin peel had an amorphous structure in which crystalline plates and platelets were inserted. The wax layer was more damaged in fruits from the rindstained orchard. The results obtained suggest (a) that damage to the epicuticular wax structure may be a factor that can influence rindstaining and peel pitting of Fortune mandarin fruits but is not a determining factor, and (b) that wax yield is not related to rindstaining and peel pitting of Fortune mandarin fruits. © 2000 Society of Chemical Industry",

      "abstract": "Human activity recognition is a challenging problem for context-aware systems and applications. It is gaining interest due to the ubiquity of different sensor sources, wearable smart objects, ambient sensors, etc. This task is usually approached as a supervised machine learning problem, where a label is to be predicted given some input data, such as the signals retrieved from different sensors. For tackling the human activity recognition problem in sensor network environments, in this paper we propose the use of deep learning (convolutional neural networks) to perform activity recognition using the publicly available OPPORTUNITY dataset. Instead of manually choosing a suitable topology, we will let an evolutionary algorithm design the optimal topology in order to maximize the classification F1 score. After that, we will also explore the performance of committees of the models resulting from the evolutionary process. Results analysis indicates that the proposed model was able to perform activity recognition within a heterogeneous sensor network environment, achieving very high accuracies when tested with new sensor data. Based on all conducted experiments, the proposed neuroevolutionary system has proved to be able to systematically find a classification model which is capable of outperforming previous results reported in the state-of-the-art, showing that this approach is useful and improves upon previously manually-designed architectures.",

The influence of hail nets on orchard light microclimate, growth, flowering and fruiting of apple trees was ex-amined in field experiment in the years 2004–2010. ‘Šampion’ and ‘Rubinstar’ apple trees grafted on M.9, were planted in spring 2004. After planting, half of the experimental plot was covered with three kinds of hail nets: white, gray and black. The other half was kept uncovered as the control. Tree growth, fruit bud formation, fruiting and fruit quality were recorded. Solar radiation was measured above and below the nets and within tree canopy. Black and gray nets stimulated tree growth and yield of ‘Šampion’ tree, but had no posi-tive influence on ‘Rubinstar’ trees. Covering the trees with gray and black nets caused poor red blush development and reduced soluble solids content in apples of both cultivars. Fruit firmness was unaffected by netting.",

However, there is still insufficient information on the relation of rootstocks in mainly cultivars of peach trees grown in Brazil. Therefore, this study aims at evaluating the performance of eight rootstocks: Aldrighi, Capdeboscq, Flordaguard, Nemaguard, Okinawa, Umezeiro, Tsukuba and Seleção Viamão grafted by 'Chimarrita' peach tree, planted in 2006 and evaluated in the 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 in Capão do Leão, RS, Brazil. The following dependent variables were evaluated on the field: floral phenology, affinity with rootstocks, trunk diameter, crown volume, number of fruits, fruit mass and productivity. Fruit mass, diameter, color, pulp firmness, total soluble solid content, titratable acidity, total phenolic content, total carotenoid content, L-ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity were evaluated. The Umezeiro rootstock provided the lowest values for crown volume, trunk diameter, number of fruits and productivity. The blossoming period of peach trees can be early or delayed depending on rootstock and harvest seasons. Field compatibility constant of Chimarrita cultivar was higher with the rootstocks of Capdeboscq, Okinawa, Tsukuba and Aldrighi. Fruits of plants grafted on Capdeboscq and Okinawa rootstocks showed reddish epidermis. The Okinawa rootstock enabled 'Chimarrita' peaches to have higher soluble solid concentrations and L-ascorbic acid. The highest concentrations of total carotenoids were verified in the pulp of fruits obtained from the 'Chimarrita' cultivar grafted on Aldrighi, Okinawa, Tsukuba and Umezeiro. The antioxidant activity of the peach pulp was higher on the Capdeboscq rootstock. Key words: Prunus persica (L.) Batsch, vegetate-productive behavior, phytochemical.",

Results obtained showed that these rootstocks modified the growth intensity of trees of both investigated plum cultivars. The trees grafted on 'Ishtara' rootstock were the most vigorous in this experiment. The least growth was on trees grafted on 'Wangenheim Prune' seedlings. Trees grafted on 'Ishtara' rootstock had a significantly higher cumulative yield per tree than those on other evaluated rootstocks. It was also proved that rootstocks had an influence on the fruit weight of both cultivars. Generally, the fruits harvested from trees grafted on Wangenheim Prune seedlings had the smallest weight. The fruit weight of trees on 'Ishtara' rootstock was the largest. Health status examination of trees of both cultivars showed that some trees grafted on 'Jaspi' rootstocks were not winter hardy enough in Polish weather conditions. As a result of this many trees grafted on this rootstock were firstly attacked by fungal diseases (Leucostoma cinta Hohn., Valsa malicola Urban.) and then they died. Taking into consideration features such as the quantity and quality of fruit crop, results from the experiment with high density planting of trees showed that plum rootstocks GF 655/2, 'Ishtara' and ST. Julien A performed well in Polish climatic conditions. In contrast, plum trees grafted on 'Wangenheim Prune', a dwarfing rootstock, require fertile soil, no specific replanting problems and appropriate high mineral fertilization.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Under cultivation, many outcrossing fruit tree species have switched from sexual reproduction to vegetative propagation. Traditional production systems have persisted, where cultivar propagation is based on a mixed reproductive system. For millenia, almond, Prunus dulcis, has been propagated by seeds. Almond grafting remained of little importance until recently. In Lebanon, both sexual and clonal reproductions are used for almond propagation. We used 15 microsatellite markers to investigate the effect of introducing graft-propagated cultivars and associated practices, on the structure of the genetic diversity among and within the two main Lebanese cultivars.<h4>Results</h4>As expected, the sexually propagated cultivar Khachabi exhibited more genotypic and genetic diversity than the vegetatively propagated cultivar Halwani. It also exhibited lower differentiation among populations. The distribution of clones showed that propagation modes were not exclusive: farmers have introduced clonal propagation in the seed-propagated cultivar while they have maintained a diversity of genotypes within populations that were mostly graft-propagated. These practices are also important to avoid mate limitations that hamper fruit production in a self-incompatible species. 'Khachabi' is structured into two gene pools separated by the Lebanese mountains. As to 'Halwani', two different gene pools were introduced. The most ancient one shares the same geographic range as 'Khachabi'; longtime coexistence and sexual reproduction have resulted in admixture with 'Khachabi'. In contrast, the more recent introduction of the second gene pool in the Bekaa region followed an evolution towards more extensive clonal propagation of 'Halwani' limiting hybridizations. Furthermore, some pairs of geographically distant 'Halwani' orchards, exhibited low genetic distances, suggesting that a network of exchanges between farmers was effective on a large scale and/or that farmers brought clonal plant material from a common source.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Almond diversification in Lebanon is clearly related to the evolution of propagation practices adapted to self-incompatible cultivars. The comparison between both cultivars demonstrated the genetic effects of the introduction of a new cultivar and the associated grafting propagation practices. Our study provided information to develop a strategy for in situ conservation of cultivars and to limit gene flow from introduced material to ancient orchards.",

In relation to the tree decline, dry matter partitioning and carbohydrate status of various tree parts at pre-bloom period were investigated in 'Kawanakajima Hakuto' grafted on P. persica (PP), P. tomentosa (PT), and a compatible interstock/P. tomentosa (IS). Under non-bearing conditions of three-year-old trees, the total whole tree dry matter amount of PT was only half of PP, whereas IS was greater than PT. However, the ratio of scion to rootstock (S/R ratio) in dry matter levels was similar (0.57-0.59) in all combinations. The starch content, the major carbohydrate in various parts, was higher in the rootstock than in scion parts, that in the roots being highest in PP among the combinations. The total amount of non-structural carbohydrate (starch+simple sugars) per tree in IS and PT was half and one-third of PP, respectively. The greatest amount of non-structural carbohydrate was found in φ<2mm roots, regardless of combinations. The S/R ratio in non-structural carbohydrate levels was 0.18 for PP, 0.31 for IS, and 0.30 for PT. On bearing four-year-old trees, the S/R ratio in dry matter levels was reduced in PP (0.47) but increased in IS (0.63) and PT (0.66). The S/R ratio in non-structural carbohydrate levels was 0.16, 0.65, and 0.80 for PP, IS, and PT, respectively. These results suggest that the tree decline in PT is partially promoted by the depletion of non-structural carbohydrate reserve at the pre-bloom period. Furthermore, the use of compatible interstock improves dry matter and non-structural carbohydrate status especially in the rootstock.",

      "abstract": "We have little knowledge of the response of invertebrate assemblages to climate change in tropical ecosystems, and few studies have compiled long-term data on invertebrates from tropical rainforests. We provide an updated list of the 72 species of Saturniidae moths collected on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, during the period 1958-2016. This list will serve as baseline data for assessing long-term changes of saturniids on BCI in the future, as 81% of the species can be identified by their unique DNA Barcode Index Number, including four cryptic species not yet formally described. A local species pool of 60 + species breeding on BCI appears plausible, but more cryptic species may be discovered in the future. We use monitoring data obtained by light trapping to analyze recent population trends on BCI for saturniid species that were relatively common during 2009-2016, a period representing >30 saturniid generations. The abundances of 11 species, of 14 tested, could be fitted to significant time-series models. While the direction of change in abundance was uncertain for most species, two species showed a significant increase over time, and forecast models also suggested continuing increases for most species during 2017-2018, as compared to the 2009 base year. Peaks in saturniid abundance were most conspicuous during El Niño and La Niña years. In addition to a species-specific approach, we propose a reproducible functional classification based on five functional traits to analyze the responses of species sharing similar functional attributes in a fluctuating climate. Our results suggest that the abundances of larger body-size species with good dispersal abilities may increase concomitantly with rising air temperature in the future, because short-lived adults may allocate less time to increasing body temperature for flight, leaving more time available for searching for mating partners or suitable oviposition sites.",

Trenches of 1 m width and 1.2 m depth were dug up between neighbouring trees. The objectives of the paper were to clarify the spatial distribution of root density of cherry trees under the soil and climate conditions of the region to expand knowledge of optimum planting distance and orchard management for a broad area of chernozems. Some soil physical properties were significantly worsened in inter-rows versus in-row, mainly due to soil compaction, and there were higher root density values in in-row versus inter-rows. Root density decreased more intensely with soil depth than with distance from trees. The pattern of root density suggests that the cherry tree density and fruit yield could be increased. However, other factors concerning orchard management and fruit yield should also be considered. The results obtained have a potential impact to improve irrigation and fertilizer application by various methods, considering the soil depth and distance from trees to wet soil, in accordance with root development.",

      "abstract": "One factor that contributes to a successful fruit tree grafting is the establishment of symplasmic contacts in the graft interface to facilitate the transfer of compounds between scion and stock. Using novel experimental and theoretical approaches we investigated whether the localized incompatibility, experienced in some Prunus grafts, could be related to insufficient plasmodesmal coupling at an early stage of development within one of the partners. Dye-coupling analysis using fluorescent tracers combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed in cultured callus from either the plum rootstock (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh. x Prunus munsoniana W. Wight et Hedr.) cv. 'Marianna 2624' or from the apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) cv. 'Moniqui' growing in vitro. Fluorescein was loaded into callus cells in a caged form. Following photoactivation of fluorescence within single cells, the uncaged fluorescein could be traced as it was spreading cell-to-cell revealing the existence of functional plasmodesmata. This set of experiments was performed within the 'stock' partner in callus fusions ('callus grafts') as well as in ungrafted callus. The results indicated species-related as well as developmental-related differences in plasmodesmal conductivity. The results further pointed to a novel control factor of connectivity that reaches the graft partner and changes its innate rate of communication: when combining the poorly transporting apricot cultivar with the well-transporting plum cultivar, communication between plum callus cells was much reduced, compared to that in plum homografts. For further support of the hypothesis, we carried out a quantitative analysis in which fluorescein was esterloaded into the callus. Fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching of fluorescein in individual cells gave a measure for the plasmodesmal contact between the cells. We found significant differences between the species with regard to mobile fraction and halftime of redistribution, which confirmed that callus cells are not interconnected to the same extent in Marianna 2624 and Moniqui.",

      "abstract": " This study investigated stand factors associated with the rate of root graft formation in lodgepole pine stands. Forty plot areas, each containing 10 trees, were excavated in pure, even-aged pine stands in western Alberta. Exposed root systems were examined for grafts and various stand measurements were recorded at each plot. Results indicate that the number of grafts per square metre is controlled by plot tree density and tree diameter. Also, the percentage of grafted trees increased with both increasing tree age and decreasing distance between trees. Grafts also appear to form relatively early in stand development; the majority of grafts in the present study had formed by the time roots were 20 years old and 50 mm in diameter. These results suggest that grafting is a common occurrence in lodgepole pine stands where trees are &lt;109 cm apart, which translates to a density of approximately 8500 stems/ha (based on even tree distribution).

      "abstract": "AbstractWater treeing is one of the main deterioration phenomena observed in the polymeric insulation of extruded crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) cables, which can affect the service life of power cables. In this work, we investigated the effect of grafting of a silane (vinyl trimethoxysilane, VTMS) on the resistance of XLPE to water treeing. A series of water‐treeing tests, the mechanical and dielectric measurements indicated that the silane‐grafting could significantly improve the water tree resistance of the conventional XLPE cable insulation with little influences on its dielectric properties, e.g., the dielectric breakdown strength, dielectric constant and loss tangent, and its mechanical performance. It was found that there exists an optimum value of VTMS concentration (about 0.6 phr) corresponding to the minimum water tree length. The water tree resistance mechanism of silane‐grafted XLPE was proposed on the basis of the process of silane hydrolysis and crosslinking. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010",

The experiment was carried out in an area that had been previously cultivated with peach trees for more than 15 years in the municipality of Eldorado do Sul, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The Maciel and Chimarrita peach tree cultivars were grafted on 'Aldrighi', 'Capdeboscq', 'Okinawa', 'Flordaguard', 'Nemaguard', and 'Umezeiro'. The 'Umezeiro' rootstock caused high plant mortality in both scions, as well as low productivity and higher alternate bearing; it also affected the qualitative and ripening attributes of the fruits of 'Chimarrita'. The 'Aldrighi', 'Capdeboscq', 'Okinawa', 'Flordaguard', and 'Nemaguard' rootstocks induced a similar yield in both scions. The trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) did not differ between rootstocks in 'Maciel', but in 'Chimarrita', TCSA was higher on 'Flordaguard' than on 'Umezeiro' in some seasons. Regarding the average of rootstocks, 'Maciel' showed higher TCSA, pruning mass, and average yield than 'Chimarrita', as well as changes in qualitative and ripening attributes. The Maciel cultivar shows the best productive performance in replanting areas, and the 'Capdeboscq' and 'Aldrighi' rootstocks induce satisfactory agronomic performance.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of xyloporosis, a disease that has severe effects on citrus trees grafted onto certain citrus rootstocks, was enigmatic for a long time. Symptoms on test hosts following transmission through grafting suggested that it was synonymous with citrus cachexia, a disease that mainly affects mandarin trees. Recent molecular studies have confirmed that certain Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) isolates induce cachexia and xyloporosis symptoms in disease-sensitive citrus hosts. These HSVd infections are mostly symptomless in numerous Near East and Western Mediterranean fruit trees and grapevines; including plants widely cultivated in those regions for several millennia, long before the emergence of xyloporosis and cachexia as diseases of citrus trees. The present review tracks historical changes in citrus propagation practices and the pathological consequences of those changes that contributed to the emergence of xyloporosis as an economically significant disease of citrus trees grafted onto Palestinian sweet lime rootstocks. The take-home message of these accounts is the need for close cooperation between plant scientists, plant protection scientists, and growers to ensure that changes and proposed improvements in horticultural and plant protection practices are subjected to comprehensive risk-assessment analyses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The relation of hand-harvesting cost in plum and prune production to the total costs amounts to 25-40%. Mechanical harvesting makes it possible to cut drastically both the harvesting and total costs. To test the suitability of plum and prune species to be mechanically harvested, an experimental grove (area 0.8 ha) was established in 2008. Three plum cultivars and one prune cultivar grafted on semi-dwarf and vigorous rootstocks were planted at high density (1250; 1666; 2500 trees·ha −1 ). During the span of full yielding (2012-2014), fruits were harvested mechanically with a canopy contact, straddle harvester in continuous motion, designed at the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, to harvest tart cherry, and later adapted to harvesting plums and prunes. Trees grafted on semi-dwarf rootstock (‘Wangenheim Prune’) appeared to be more suitable for mechanical harvesting than strong-growing trees grafted on Prunus cerasifera clone ‘Myrobalan’. Cumulative yield per ha (years 2012-2014) was the highest at the highest planting density. Trees grafted on the semi-dwarf rootstock had a higher productivity index than trees grafted on the vigorous rootstock. There was no significant difference in fruit quality related to planting distance. Mechanical harvesting was nearly 40 times more efficient than hand picking. The efficiency of mechanical harvest was from 85% to 90%. Over 5% of fruits were lost on the ground and from 1 to 5% of fruits were left on the tree. Up to 18% of the plums and no more than 10% of the prunes harvested mechanically showed some damage. They can be fully acceptable for processing, for up to 10 days, providing the potential deterioration processes are inhibited by cold storage. The large-fruited cultivars seem to be more susceptible to bruising than the small-fruited ones. For the latter, the share of marketable quality fruits within the mechanically harvested crop amounted to about 80%, which could be a good prognostic justifying further trials on the prune harvester.",

      "abstract": "Phenolic compounds extracted from the graft union of heterograft trees (Prunus persica/P. tomentosa) were analyzed by histochemistry and HPLC methods and compared with those on homograft trees (P. persica/P. persica). A DMACA (p-dimethylamino-cinnamaldehyde) staining method showed that at early stages after budding the phenols were localized mainly in the callus cells, in the new xylem and in the cortical tissues of the heterograft combination and persisted even 6 months after budding. These phenolic compounds frequently surrounded necrotic tissues which seemingly impeded the union between the scion and rootstock. From the HPLC analysis, four phenolic compounds were found as major components in both rootstocks, but two of them were not detected in the phloem of dwarfing P. tomentosa. The chemical nature of these peaks was unknown, except one was identified as catechin ; however, based on their UV spectrum, behavior in TLC and retention time, our assignments are tentative. In general, the phenolic content in the phloem tissues was higher in homograft than in heterograft trees, particularly peaks # 1 and # 3, which we suppose are prunin and naringenin respectively. However, in the xylem tissues on heterograft trees the phenolic concentration was much smaller and the patterns from the stock to the scion were different from those observed on homograft trees. Peak # 1, prunin and Peak # 2 accumulated in the phloem above the heterograft union ; whereas in the xylem, Peak # 1, prunin, and Peak # 3, naringenin, were present at low amounts. Catechin, a low molecular weight flavan occurred in similar amounts in the xylem of both combinations, accumulating at the graft union, whereas the phloem, of the homograft contained a larger amount of catechin.",

As planting density increased, the number of flower buds per tree and the percent of flower bud formation decreased, but the number of flower buds per hectare tended to increase. 2. The relationship between the number of flower buds per tree (Z) and the planting density (ρ) could be represented by the following reciprocal equation. 1/Z=(1.46ρ+82.7)10-6 (1) Also, the relationship between the number of flower buds per hectare (δ) and the planting density (ρ) could be represented by the following reciprocal equation. 1/δ=1.46·10-6+82.7·10-6/ρ (3) 3. The number of flower buds per tree and the percent of flower buds formed were negatively correlated to the tree height/spread ratio, indicating that the decrease of flower bud formation with an increased planting density was closely related to the upright form of the trees. 4. The vertical distribution of flower buds was closely related to the attenuation pattern of relative solar radiation along the canopy profile, indicating that the decrease of flower bud formation with an increased planting density was caused by decreasing of relative solar radiation. 5. In the 5th leaf of trees on M.9, an inhibition of 5% and more in flower buds formation occurred at higher density. As the trees aged, the inhibition shifted to the lower density plot. This shifting rate was accelerated in trees on M.26, M.7, and MM.106, compared with trees on M.9. The relationship between the percent of flower buds formed (φ) and the planting density (ρ) could be represented by the following reciprocal equation from the age of 6 years for trees/M.9 and 5 years for trees on other rootstocks, 1/φ=Aφρ+Bφ (4) where φ is 0≤φ≤100, and Aφ and Bφ depend on the tree age and rootstocks. 6. The φ remains constant at a lower LAI (F), whereas it decreased abruptly at a certain LAI. The relationship between the F and the φ could be approximated with the following two equations, In case of 0<F≤-b/2a, φ=-(b2/4a)+c (5) In case of F≥-b/2a, φ=aF2+bF+c (6) where a, b and c depend on the tree age and rootstocks. 7. LAI at which φ begins to decrease is defined as the critical LAI (Fφcri); Fφcri is expressed by the following equation. Fφcri=-b/2a (7) The Fφcri estimated by Eq. (7) had values of 1.9a2.1, regardless of tree age and rootstocks. 8. The relationship between the planting density (ρcri) and the number of flower buds per tree (ucri) at Fφcri, regardless of tree age and rootstocks, could be expressed as follows : ρcri=1.5×104·ucri-0.92 (10)",

      "abstract": "The growth of micropropagated (M) Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kakl Thunb. cv. Nishimura wase) trees from the 8th to llth year after planting was compared with that of trees grafted on seedlings (G) in the orchard. The M trees grew more vigorously than did the G trees; the differences in tree canopy and trunk cross-sectional area between the M and G trees increased annually. The percentage of shoots with male flowers in the total number of shoots in the M trees was lower than that in the G trees., although the difference was not significant. The percentage of shoots with female flowers in the total number of shoots in the M trees was the same as that in the G trees. Although the yield per tree of M trees was larger than that of G trees, there was no significant difference between the G and M trees in the yield efficiency (yield per canopy volume). These results suggest that micropropagation caused reinvigoration, but not true rejuvenation. M trees showed uniform growth, flowering and fruiting.",

Fruits of both cultivars on Myrobalan and/or Blackthorn grew with a classic double sigmoid curve from full bloom time to harvest. During growth and development periods, average fruit weight of both cultivars significantly increased, but differences between rootstock and interstem were not found. Myrobalan induced higher values of most fruit physical features (fruit thickness, sphericity, aspect ratio, surface area, fruit volume, flesh firmness) and some chemical attributes (soluble solids content and titratable acidity), whereas Blackthorn induced only higher ripening index values. Regarding cultivars, ‘Roksana’ possessed better physical features, except flesh firmness, and higher soluble solids content, ripening index value, total flavonoids content and total antioxidant capacity. Present results confirm the better adaptation of Myrobalan rootstock with ‘Roksana’ and ‘Harcot’ scion cultivar to sandy loam and acidic soil than Blackthorn",

The rootstocks used were the dwarfing rootstocks P-HL A and GiSelA 5, and the vigorous rootstock F 12/1. The following data were collected: total root length, mean root diameter, total root surface area, total root volume, total number of root tips, root fresh weight and root dry weight. pH in the rhizosphere was measured with an antimony microelectrode. Roots were analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium content using standard laboratory techniques. Generally, root length, root surface area, root volume, and number of root tips were highest in GiSelA 5 and lowest in F 12/1. Root fresh weight and root dry weight were also highest in GiSelA 5. Root calcium concentration was lower in P-HL A and GiSelA 5 than in F 12/1. The rhizosphere pH in all three rootstocks was higher at the root tips than in the root bases or middle portions of the roots, especially in GiSelA 5. This means that the young and actively growing root tips are more actively engaged in ion transport than older root bases. Further experiments will concentrate on how the morphology and physiology of dwarfing rootstocks influence growth and performance in the scion cultivar. Ion transport between the root and the rhizosphere deserves special attention.",

      "abstract": "Grafting and budding are common horticultural techniques, and similar techniques have been successfully used in the management of tree wounds by bridge and approach grafting. The success of bark grafts raises the possibility of using bark patch grafts to span trunk wounds and pruning cuts. Fifty seedling trees from each of six commonly planted Australian native and exotic species—Acacia dealbata, Banksia integrifolia, Eucalyptus viminalis, Platanus × acerifolia, Quercus robur, and Pinus radiata—had circular plugs of bark removed from their stem using a #3 cork borer (9 mm diameter). The plugs were lifted from the stem and then re-attached at one of four rotations (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) to the original cambial orientation in each of the four seasons. While there was no successful re-attachment for Pinus radiata, the data for the successful re-attachment of the other five species showed that the most successful orientation for re-attachment was in the original position (0 degrees); successful attachment did occur at other orientations. The best season for re-attachment was spring, but successful attachment did occur in other seasons; success was lowest when grafting was undertaken in winter. The use of bark patch grafts may provide arborists with an additional method for dealing with large wounds caused by vandalism and accidents, and would be particularly useful if a tree was of special, historic, or environmental significance to the landscape. Covering the wound with a bark patch graft may conceal the removal of a branch, hide obvious scarring, and at the same time reduce the risk of disease and stress to the tree by closing the wound more quickly than would normally occur due to natural callusing.",

Treatments are; irrigation intervals (main plots) D1= 3 days, D2 =6 days and pan coefficients (submain plots) K1= Kcp x 1.00, K2= Kcp x 0.80, K3= Kcp x 0.60, K4= Kcp x 0.40.The trial began by establishing a new orchard and the treatments were applied in the second year. There was no effect on yield until 2003. Treatment K4=0.40 was suggested for young apple trees until their fruitful period. According to the obtained apple yield, the treatments showed major effects on both irrigation interval and water amount (D2 and K1) for the yield of apple. The total amount of irrigation water of suggested treatment (D2K1) was between 200mm and 252mm; and the total amount of seasonal water use of D2K1 was between 294 mm and 394mm.The values relating to the yield for 2003, 2005 and 2007 according to the suggested treatment were 13, 90 (kg/tree), 37, 56 (kg/tree) and 30.76 (kg/tree) respectively. According to the year obtained apple yield, values relating to quality characteristics were measured. Quality class I and fruit apple number showed optimum values in treatment of irrigation water amount Kcp= 1, 00. Resoluble dry matter showed maximum value in treatment of irrigation water amount Kcp= 0, 40. The characteristics of firmness, fruit pH, malic acid were not affected by the treatments",

      "abstract": "We propose a simulated annealing based zero-skew clock net construction algorithm that works in any routing spaces, from Manhattan to Euclidean, with the added flexibility of optimizing either the wire length or the propagation delay. We first devise an O(log n) tree grafting perturbation function to construct a zero-skew clock tree under the Elmore delay model. This tree grafting scheme is able to explore the entire solution space asymptotically. A Gauss-Seidel iteration procedure is then applied to optimize the Steiner point positions. Experimental results have shown that our algorithm can achieve substantial delay reduction and encouraging wire length minimization compared to previous works.< <ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Exposing a plant to stress situations, such as grafting, generally triggers antioxidant defense systems. In fruit tree grafting, quince (Cydonia oblonga) is widely used as a rootstock for pear (Pyrus communis L.), but several economically important pear cultivars are incompatible with available quince rootstocks. In this study, grafts were established using an in vitro callus graft system mimicking the events taking place in fruit trees. In vitro grown callus from pear [P. communis L. cv. 'Conference' (Co) and cv. 'William' (Wi)] and quince (C. oblonga Mill. clone 'BA29') was used to establish the compatible homografts 'Co/Co', 'Wi/Wi' and 'BA29/BA29', the compatible heterograft 'Co/BA29' and the incompatible heterograft 'Wi/BA29'. The main objective was to determine whether specific isoforms of genes involved in oxidative stress [superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT)] are differentially expressed at the graft interface from compatible and incompatible unions throughout 3 weeks after grafting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and programmed cell death were also evaluated in the course of graft development. Genes differentially expressed between compatible and incompatible heterografts were identified. Transcript levels of six antioxidant genes (SOD1, SOD3, APX3, APX6, CAT1 and CAT3) were down-regulated 10 days after grafting (DAG) in the incompatible heterograft in comparison to the compatible one. Likewise, SOD enzymatic activities were significantly higher at 1 and 10 days after wounding in the compatible cultivar 'Co' than in the incompatible one 'Wi'. These findings, together with live cell imaging of ROS-specific probes, ultrastructural mitochondrial changes and DNA fragmentation related to apoptotic processes, give indications that within incompatible rootstock/scion interfaces, either the level of ROS is increased or there is a less efficient detoxification system.",

      "abstract": "Taiwan, located in subtropic regions, naturally is not an ideal region for temperate-zone fruit trees' production due to the supra-optimum temperature, heavy rainfall, and higher relative humidity in summer and insufficient chilling in winter. Higher relative humidity and temperature in summer and autumn months cause excessive vegetative growth, resulting in poor flowerbud initiation and formation. Typhoon invasions result in the severe damage of twigs as well as the loss of quality and yield of fruits. In order to overcome these natural barriers, Hengshan (Pyrus serotina Rehd.) pear has been selected as a major cultivar for lowlands in Taiwan. It has low-chilling requirement and higher temperature tolerance. Branches of Hengshan are pulled and tied to a horizontal wire net to adapt to the environmental status. This trellis system enhances flowerbud initiation through the retardation of vegetative growth. It also induces numerous water shoots. Scions from high-chilling cultivars grown at a high altitude on mountains are grafted onto water shoots of Hengshan pear trees. The system has been successful in the production of both high-chilling pears in June and the Hengshan pears in August, and has made production of both pears an important industry in Taiwan. Heavy load and trellis systems, however, result in hastening the senescence of Hengshan trees. Vitality of trees could be restored by grafting scions from a vigorous cultivar, P. koehnei, onto the terminal position of the branches. The practice resulted in several advantages including: 1) uniform growth of branches, 2) redistribution of water shoots, 3) inducing formation of calluses on old damaged trunks, 4) quick recovery of mealybug-damaged branches, 5) rejuvenation of branches, and 6) termination of dormancy.",

Use has therefore been made of naturally occurring grafts in the study of sudden‐death disease. Volunteer seedlings often grow up closely adpressed to old trees. If the old tree dies from sudden‐death disease, the pole† usually survives, but occasionally it dies almost simultaneously with the old tree. The poles discussed invariably had an independent root system, but those which died were found to have their roots grafted to those of the old tree whilst poles which survived, although closely adpressed to the old tree, had no organic connexion with it. These observations cannot be reconciled with any but a pathogenic hypothesis as to the nature of the sudden‐death disease.",

Nucleotide sequencing of CVd-IIIa showed that it was 297 nucleotides in length and CVd-IV was found 284 nucleotides in length. Sequences of these viroids were essentially the same as those described in literature. No viroids were detected in the normal sized Meyer lemon trees in the same orchard. The possibility that Meyer lemon or the combination of Meyer lemon on sour orange rootstock is sensitive to this viroid is discussed.",

In this research, modifications of HDPE and PP, through melt grafting MAH in the presence of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) in a co-rotating twin screw extruder were carried out to prepare the samples as compatibilizers. The grafting efficiency of the maleated samples was measured by back-titration and FT-IR spectroscopy methods. The extent of chain branching/crosslinking side reactions were evaluated with melt flow index determination and the melt viscosities of the grafted samples were measured using a capillary rheometer. It was found that the maximum grafting degree of HDPE at 2.44 % was obtained by the application of 4 phr of MAH and 0.125 phr of DCP, and the maximum grafting degree of PP at 2.67 % was obtained by the application of 5 phr of MAH and 0.3 phr of DCP. These results were attributed to the limited solubility of DCP and MAH in the polyolefin melt and suggested that the reactant concentration played a major role in the properties of the grafted samples.",

Growth and cropping of plum trees both originated from in vitro (TC trees) and grafted on ‘Wangenheim Prune ’ rootstock, of seven cultivars – ‘Seneca’, ‘Čačanska Najbolia’, ‘Čačanska Rodna’, ‘Stanley’, ‘Bluefre’, ‘Valor’, ‘Oneida’, were compared. The orchard was established in the spring of 1995. Trees started fruiting in the third year after planting. The following parameters were compared: yield, trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) and index of productivity. In the first and second year of cropping the highest yield was obtained from trees grafted on ‘Wangenheim Prune ’ rootstock, while in the third and fourth year it was provided by TC trees. Total yield of four-year cropping did not statistically differ between the TC trees and those grafted on the rootstock, but the growth of the first was greater. The productivity index (kg·cm-2) was higher for trees grafted on ‘Wangenheim Prune ’ rootstock. Key words: grafted trees, tree growth, crop, tissue culture trees 124 INTRODUCTION. One of the aims of fruit production research is obtaining a higher yield per unit area by increasing the number of trees per hectare. Tree growth can be controlled by the rootstock",

The results showed that the xylem radial growth ofthe scion was universally slower than that of the stock and the difference was caused by the original growth characters of their parent plants of scion and stock rather than graft compatibility.(1)When scion and stock were of the same kind of clone the scion growth ability was determ ined by the developmentalphase the xylem width differentiated from juvenile scion was significantly larger than that of mature scion while there was no obvious difference between the stocks that in close proxim ity to the two kinds ofscions.(2)The xylem growth of scion was markedly affected by the growth potential of stock. The stronger the growth potential of the stocks had, the faster the stock and scion grew，the m ore differenceswere made between the two parts.(3)When mature scions of three clones were grafted onto a single seedling the differences ofxylem growth among the scions were depended on the scions' own growth charThe effect of scion growth on stock was insignificant. M icroscopical observation indicated that therubber tree grafting was com patible, with newly differentiated xylem of the scion inlaid in that of the stock and vascular tissues such as vessels and the bark in the graft union connected well.",

      "abstract": "The Camellia luteoflora and C. longistyla are endemic species in Guizhou, and their distributed zone is very narrow. Their flower, fruit, leaf and shape have very good ornamental plant feature so that it is necessary to carry out a nursery stock produce technique research and its produce market forecast for development. We are conducting an experiment research of nursery stock propagation and cultivation technique for their products development and marketing forecast. The results of analysis are: 1, The trade nursery stock produce for product development have priority way of tissue culture and rapid propagation > cutting cultivation > Grafting cultivation. The 3 methods are for suitable for marketing, and their return rates are 50%+ -30%, 50%+ -15% and 50%+ -10%, respectively; 2, Because Camellia luteoflora and C. longistyla natural distribution is very narrow and their population is very rare, introduction or ex situ conservation of their germ plasma and cultivation of saplings are used by cutting cultivation, tissue culture technique, and rapid propagation. ; 3. Robust spring twigs collectde in May or June every year are suitable for cutting cultivation. Cutting bed shading degree is 20~30%. The two Camellia strike root rate difference achieve 65~80% and 60~90% by submerying in 300~500mug/L NAA for 12~16 hours. The effect of 300mug/L NAA is very good and the strike root rate is > =80%; 4, The two Camellia adopt tree grafting and bud grafting gain success. The 2 methods result for live rates are 40~52% and 76~82%; 5, Camellia luteoflora and C. longistyla can grow transplant seedlings after 60~80 days stem tip culture and rapid propagation. The transplant seedling live rate is 90%; 6. By Delphi method it is calculated that Guiyang city marketing requirement growth rate is 20~15% for the two species of ornamental from 2000 to 2005. In 2005, the total consume demand is 6, 000, 000 yuan (Chinese currency). Every 100~150 cm high plant price will be 100~150 yuan. The marketing prospects will be bright and deserve development vigorously.",
