## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a theory that describes the action selection and learning mechanisms of an agent in an environment.”
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle is a fundamental principle of self-organization that states that systems minimize their free energy.”
*   Bayesian Belief Updating (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian belief updating is a method for updating our beliefs based on new evidence.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the free energy function.”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL divergence is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions.”
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean-field approximation is a simplification of the model that assumes that the state variables are independent of each other.”
*   Discrete-Time (exact quote from paper) – “The agent acts in a discrete-time setting with a finite-time horizon.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a Python library for data analysis.”

## Datasets

*   T-Maze (exact quote from paper) – “The T-maze environment is a standard benchmark for active inference research.”
*   No other datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   No other evaluation metrics are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment.”
*   No other software tools or platforms are explicitly mentioned in the paper.
