Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core principle of active inference is that the brain is a predictive model that seeks to minimize the difference between its predictions and the sensory evidence it receives.”
*   Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – “We use Bayesian filtering to update our belief about the system’s state given new observations.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding intelligent behavior as a process of minimizing free energy.”
*   Autoregressive Models (exact quote from paper) – “We use autoregressive models, which are characterized by a linear relationship between the current state and the previous state.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The parameters of the model are optimized using gradient descent.”
*   Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm (exact quote from paper) – “The parameters of the model are optimized using the EM algorithm.”
*   Störmer-Verlet Integration (exact quote from paper) – “The second-order Störmer-Verlet integration method is used to solve the equations of motion.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks.”

## Datasets

*   Double Mass-Spring-Damper System (exact quote from paper) – “We use a double mass-spring-damper system as a testbed for our active inference agent.”
