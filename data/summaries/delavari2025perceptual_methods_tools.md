## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free-energy principle posits that all systems, from simple organisms to complex brains, minimize their free energy by actively predicting their sensory inputs and acting to reduce the discrepancy between these predictions and the actual observations.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how systems, such as brains and robots, interact with their environments. It is based on the idea that systems actively predict their sensory inputs and act to reduce the discrepancy between these predictions and the actual observations.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.”
*   U-Net (exact quote from paper) – “U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture commonly used for image segmentation tasks.”
*   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (exact quote from paper) – “CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for processing images.”
*   Contrastive Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Contrastive active inference is a framework that combines active inference with contrastive learning to improve the accuracy of predictions.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method that uses Bayes’ theorem to update beliefs based on new evidence.”
*   Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (exact quote from paper) – “DDPG is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines the advantages of both deterministic and stochastic policy gradient methods.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is a common metric for evaluating the difference between predicted and actual values.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries
