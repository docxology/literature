## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of Active Inference is the Free Energy Principle, which posits that intelligent behavior arises from minimizing a quantity known as the free energy.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference is a subtype of Variational Inference.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The optimization procedure is based on gradient descent.”
*   Expected Free Energy (EFE) (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference proposes an alternative approach to planning under uncertainty, providing a neurobiological explanation of intelligent behavior by positing that the optimal policy emerges when minimizing a quantity known as the Expected Free Energy (EFE).”
*   Planning as Inference (PAI) (exact quote from paper) – “However, the real-world challenge lies in environments where dynamics are stochastic or partially unknown. Popular methods that operate under unknown dynamics are rooted in Reinforcement Learning [Sutton and Barto, 1998], which optimizes long-term utility through value function or policy estimation.”
*   Max-Entropy Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “This framework provides an alternative approach to planning under uncertainty.”
*   Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “Reinforcement Learning with Deep Neural Networks (DRQN) [Sutton and Barto, 1998]”
*   Value Function Estimation (exact quote from paper) – “value function or policy estimation.”
*   Policy Estimation (exact quote from paper) – “policy estimation.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference proposes an alternative approach to planning under uncertainty.”
*   Epistemic Drive (exact quote from paper) – “The epistemic drive corresponds to a unique entropic contribution within the variational objective.”
*   Message Passing (exact quote from paper) – “a message-passing scheme that corresponds to the found formulation of Active Inference.”
