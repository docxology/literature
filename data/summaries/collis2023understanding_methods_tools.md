## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference (AIF) extends this idea and casts action, perception and learning as being underwritten by the same underlying process of Bayesian inference" – mentioned in 1. Introduction
*   Bayesian Model Inversion (exact quote from paper) – "Bayesian model inversion, withincomingsensorydataupdatingthesecausalmodelsoftheworldinaccordancewithBayes’rule" – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – "theminimisationofsensorysurprisal isachievedthroughtheminimisationofatractablequantity" – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
*   Dirichlet Distribution (exact quote from paper) – "priorbeliefsoverthecategoricaldistribution" – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels" – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels" – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “theminimisationofsensorysurprisal isachievedthroughtheminimisationofatractablequantity” – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
*   POMDPs (Partial Observable Markov Decision Processes) (exact quote from paper) – “implementour simulations agentwithanAIFframeworkindiscretestatespaceusingthePythonpackagepymdp[13].” – mentioned in 2. Active Inference
