- **Reasoning**: The paper presents an Active Inference model, which is a core theoretical framework for understanding perception and action. It focuses on developing a computational user model for spatial pointing, incorporating continuous state, action, and observation spaces, and probabilistic delay compensation. The model's primary contribution is the theoretical development of a novel approach to modeling human interaction rather than a tool or application.

An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click Behaviour1 IntroductionPointing is a fundamental interaction technique andHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI)has a long history of studying human pointing behaviour [18]. Pointing is a way of communicating information through an interface by manipulating a user-controlled cursor into spatial partitions corresponding to actions; typically, these are discrete actions like selecting a menu item. Modelling pointing behaviour is crucial in engineering interactions well-suited to human capabilities, or in predicting the behaviour of users in using an existing interface without real users in the loop. As a prevalent and tractable interaction problem, it has attracted substantial attention in the HCI literature. HCI has historically focused on high-level descriptive models of pointing using summary statistics.arXiv:2510.14611v1[cs.HC]16 Oct20252 M. Klar et al.Fitts’ Law [5,6,14] is the classic model, and relates the expected time taken to acquire a target (with a certain tolerated error rate) to the size and distance of the target from the cursor origin. While such models are effective in explaining movement time and are simple to apply, they do not attempt to model the detailed process of target acquisition itself, and do not consider click dynamics. Insights into complete cursor trajectories would enable more precise prediction of user intentions and the development of improved assistive tools.One way to improve this understanding is to build a fine-grained, computational, generative model of the human user that synthesises the entire target acquisition process. Approaches to model whole pointing trajectories have been introduced, e.g. in [3,16,4,15,13], often with models derived from a control-theoretic perspective, such as the Minimum Jerk model [7] or the E-LQG [25]. Other approaches have applied machine learning to derive policies that emulate human behaviour from data [1,2,10]. These classical models typically rely on the design of cost or reward functions, which are often defined by a combination of the distance between the cursor and the target and the control effort required to reach it. They are also typically deterministic in that they do not model or represent uncertainty explicitly, some even requiring a predefined movement time. Furthermore, in contrast to our approach, these focus on cursor movement only and clicking is usually not included, or seen as a separate task.We propose the application of active inference (AIF) [19] to create a pointing model that is fully probabilistic, predictive and formulates the problem in terms of preferences over observations, rather than rewards. Different behaviour for difficult targets, which occurs in real user data (see Fig.1), should emerge from greater uncertainty in the target acquisition rather than changed model and reward parameters – which is often the case in the classical models of pointing mentioned above. As an underlying model, we make use of the well-understood Second-Order Lag model which is commonly used to model human mouse pointing [23,16,4]. Using such a simple system to represent the human motor control system allows us to focus on the AIF agent’s inference and control. We additionally apply perceptual noise and delay in order to achieve a more human-like behaviour [20,21]. AIF is a widely-applicable model of the behaviour of organisms that unifies Bayesian models of perception with a probabilistic model for action under uncertainty. It postulates behaviour as a process of reducing surprise to drive the environment into preferred configurations and minimising uncertainty that might, in the future, lead to disfavoured states.Recently there has been interest in bringing active inference concepts into the study and practice of HCI, see reviews such as [17] and [26]. Stein et al. [24] explored ordinal selection with AIF, i.e., selecting the target from a set of discrete elements, but modelling pointing with AIF has not been explored. In the context of pointing, AIF offers a fundamentally different perspective. An AIF formulation frames pointing as a continuous process of minimising prediction error by continuously updating internal beliefs based on sensory input. Active inference defines the goals of a (simulated) user in terms of a distribution over desired observations. For example, rather than moving the cursor exactly to the centre of the target, the user might be satisfied as long as there is a high chance of clicking the button correctly. However, AIF has typically been applied in discrete contexts or in restricted forms. Modelling pointing, at the level of dynamic trajectory generation, requires a continuous representation of actions (such as potentials to be propagated to a simulated motor system), states, and observations (such as cursor position). We propose an AIF model that is capable of modelling fine-grained pointing behaviour in this continuous setting, and which generalises to different tasks and environments.In summary, our contributions are:–A continuous active inference formulation of point and click behaviour which does not rely on arbitrary discretisations, appropriately models perceptual noise and delay, and provides probabilistic predictions of cursor trajectories.–An empirical study of a classical1D pointing task with our active inference model, including a comparison of pointing trajectories with behaviour observed in a user study.3 Active Inference for Continuous Dynamic Systems withObservation Noise and Perceptual DelayControl of a human limb is an example of the general problem of control of a dynamic system. Section A describes the notation for such continuous system dynamics, how the agent constructs a belief about the states, dynamics and noise, as well as how it updates them. Specific adaptations of the standard general active inference approach in our model include:4 M. Klar et al.– System Dynamics:The general equations are described in Section A.1. In the context of modelling a human pointing with a mouse, the system state may be a combination of the cursor’s position and velocity and whether the mouse button is being clicked. The observation reflects the user’s visual, proprioceptive, or haptic perceptions, which are noisy by nature.– Probabilistic Beliefs of AIF Agentare constructed about the states, dynamics and noise:1. Belief about system stateQs :=N(µ s, Σs).2. Belief about parameters of the system dynamicsQθ :=N(µ θ, Σθ).3. Belief about noise in observationsQp := exp(N(µp, Σp)). Each of these beliefs is represented by the mean and covariance matrix of a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution. Since the belief about the noiseQp describes the standard deviation of the different noise factors and thus needs to be positive at all times, we choose a log-normal distribution for robustness.– BeliefUpdate mechanismsare mostlystandard,andaredescribedinSectionA.2. To efficiently update the agent’s belief after performing an action, we use an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which can be used to propagate Gaussian random variables through system dynamics [27,11].– Action Selectionis based on minimising Expected Free Energy (EFE) as described in SectionA.3. Since these calculations require a lot of computation time, especially when the horizonNis large, the evaluation in this work will exclude simulations with information gain.– Perceptual Delayis modelled by constructing a belief abouts(t−τ)for a given perceptual delay ofτ∈Ntimesteps and updating this belief using the observationo(t−τ)obtained in stept. Before action selection, the agent uses its generative model and the last actions to create a temporary beliefabouts(t)by sequential updates. Additionally, we let the agent know about the exact target location only after the initial delay (see Section3.2).An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click Behaviour31.00.50.0Time [s]80010001200140016001800Cursor Position [px]1.00.50.0Time [s]Fig.1: Mouse cursor trajectories (green lines) and clicks (green crosses) of one human user pointing and clicking at targets (red) with different distance (850px,537px,225px) and different widths (left:100px, right:20px).t=0indicates the moment of a correct click.The errorbars showtheend-pointstandarddeviations.
