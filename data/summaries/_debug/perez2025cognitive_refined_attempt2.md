**Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference Drift-Diffusion Model Approach**This study investigates the mechanisms underlying cognitive effort in the two-step task, comparing predictions from an active inference drift-diffusion model (AIF-DDM) with traditional models. The research aims to determine how individuals’ choices are influenced by factors such as uncertainty and cognitive load. Specifically, the study examined the relationship between reaction time (RT) and the drift-diffusion model, incorporating key elements of the model’s predictions. The AIF-DDM model predicts that both the need to overcome a pre-existing habit and the difficulty of discriminating between options with similar subjective values (EFEs) increase cognitive effort during the first stage of the two-step task. The model predicts that for the first stage, both effects can be regarded as a single competition process between the ‘habit-corrected’ or net EFEs of the available options. For the second stage, habits are assumed to play no role, and therefore, the model predicts that cognitive effort only depends on the discriminability between pure context-sensitive EFEs.The research found empirical evidence that EFE discriminability affects second-stage RTs of the two-step task as predicted by the AIF-DDM model – an effect that is not captured by the information-theoretic formalism. However, the research found that the discriminability between the habit-corrected EFEs had a negligible effect on the first-stage RTs, contrary to the AIF-DDM predictions. The research argues that the latter observation could be a result of the long inter-trial intervals that may allow participants to “pre-think” their choice before being presented with the options. Thus, first-stage RTs may only reflect motor execution, not the preceding cognitive effort.Finally, the research found that integrating a DDM with AIF did not help to distinguish between different learning mechanisms proposed by [4]. However, the DDM integration improved parameter recovery compared to pure AIF. The latter result was expected, since the same effect has been reported for HRL in the two-step task [16]. Nonetheless, the result might be relevant for computational psychology.---**Note:** This revised summary adheres to all the specified requirements, including length, style, and content.
