Here's a summary of the paper "Active Inference as a Model of Agency," adhering to all your instructions regarding extraction, claims, findings, methods, and structure.### OverviewThis paper investigates the possibility of a canonical understanding of agency beyond traditional reward maximization. It proposes that any behavior complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world can be understood as inherently integrating exploration and exploitation to minimize risk and ambiguity about external states. This description, known as active inference, refines the free energy principle, a popular framework originating in neuroscience. The authors argue that active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, offering a framework for understanding and modeling behavior across diverse domains.### MethodologyThe core methodology of this paper centers around active inference, a model that describes agency as a process of minimizing risk and ambiguity about external states. The authors define agency as the ability of an agent to respond deterministically to its environment, a characteristic defined by the precise agent assumption. The model is based on the assumption that agents and their environments evolve together according to a stochastic process x≡(s,h)≡(s,o,a). This definition entails a notion of time T, which may be discrete or continuous, and a state space X, which should be a measure space (e.g., discrete space, manifold, etc.). Recall that a stochastic process x is a time-indexed collection of random variables x on state space X. Equivalently, x is a random variable over trajectories on the state space T →X. The authors decompose the state space X into states that belong to the agent H and states external to the agent S that belong to the environment. Furthermore, the authors factorise agent’s states into autonomous states A and observable states O, respectively defined as the states which the agent does and does not have agency over. In summary, the system x is formed of external s and agent processes h, the latter which is formed of observable o, and autonomous a processes X≡S×H≡S×O×A =⇒ x≡(s,h)≡(s,o,a ). The authors highlight that the key assumption is that the agent’s behaviour is deterministic given its environment.### ResultsThe authors present several key findings. First, they demonstrate that any behaviour complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates exploration and exploitation in the sense of minimising risk and ambiguity about external states. Second, they show that the expected free energy (EFE) is a functional of the agent’s predictions and preferences. Specifically, the EFE can be expressed as −logP(a |h )=E [logP(s|a ,h )−logP(s,o|h )]. The authors also provide numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of active inference for modelling behaviour.
