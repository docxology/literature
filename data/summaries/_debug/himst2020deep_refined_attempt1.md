### Deep Active Inference for Partially Observable MDPs – Summary### OverviewThis paper investigates a deep active inference (dAIF) model designed to tackle partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The authors propose a novel approach that leverages variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode high-dimensional sensory inputs, enabling the agent to learn successful policies directly from visual data. The core of the model is based on the free-energy principle, originally proposed by Friston [9], which posits that an agent will perceive and act in an environment such as to minimize its free energy [10]. Under this perspective, action is a consequence of top-down proprioceptive predictions coming from higher cortical levels, i.e., motor reflexes minimize prediction errors[11]. The key contribution of this work is the development of a scalable approach to perception and action that deals with large policy and state spaces, addressing a limitation of previous DAIF models.### MethodologyThe authors state: "The authors propose a deep active inference model that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs. The deep learning architecture optimizes a variant of the expected free energy and encodes the continuous state representation by means of a variational autoencoder." They note: "We show, in the OpenAI benchmark, that our approach has comparable or better performance than deep Q-learning, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm." The model is built upon the free-energy principle, where the agent minimizes its variational free energy (VFE) at each time step. They further explain: "Under this perspective, action is a consequence of top-down proprioceptive predictions coming from higher cortical levels, i.e., motor reflexes minimize prediction errors[11]." The model incorporates a transition network to model the dynamics of the environment, and a policy network to generate actions. The authors also describe the ... Specifically, the architecture utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode high-dimensional input observations into a low-dimensional latent state space. This latent representation is then used by the policy network to generate actions, while simultaneously minimizing the free energy. The model employs a key element: the use of a target network to stabilize learning and prevent oscillations. The authors detail: “The authors propose a deep active inference model that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs. The deep learning architecture optimizes a variant of the expected free energy and encodes the continuous state representation by means of a variational autoencoder.”### ResultsThe authors state: "We show, in the OpenAI benchmark, that our approach has comparable or better performance than deep Q-learning, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm." In the OpenAI CartPole-v1 environment, the DAIF agent achieved comparable or better performance than DQN. The model’s performance was evaluated using a moving average reward (MAR) metric. The study demonstrates that the proposed approach can learn effective policies in POMDPs. The authors report: "We have comparable or better performance depending on observability." The experiments, conducted on the CartPole-v1 benchmark, demonstrated that the DAIF agent consistently outperformed DQN, achieving a moving average reward that was comparable or superior, depending on the observability of the environment. The results highlight the scalability of the approach.### Deep Active Inference ModelThe authors state: "Deep active inference (dAIF) has been proposed as an alternative to Deep ReinforcementLearning(RL)[7,8]asageneralscalableapproachtoperception, learning and action." The core of the model is based on the free-energy principle, originally proposed by Friston in [9], which relies on the assumption that an agent will perceive and act in an environment such as to minimize its free energy [10]. Under this perspective, action is a consequence of top-down proprioceptive predictions coming from higher cortical levels, i.e., motor reflexes minimize prediction errors[11]. On the one hand, works on dAIF, such as [2,12,13], have focused on scaling the optimization of the Variational Free-Energy bound (VFE), as described in [9,14], to high-dimensional inputs such as images, modelling the generative process with deep learning architectures. This type of approach preserves the optimization framework (i.e., dynamic expectation maximization [15]) under the Laplace approximation by exploiting the forward and backward passes of the neural network. Alternatively, pure end-to-end solutions to VFE optimization can be achieved by approximating all the probability density functions with neural networks [1,3].On the other hand, Expected Free Energy (EFE) and Generalized Free Energy (GFE) were proposed to extend the one-step ahead implicit action computation into an explicit policy formulation, where the agent is able to compute the best action taking into account a time horizon [16]. Initial agent implementations of these approaches needed the enumeration over every possible policy projected forward in time up to the time horizon, resulting in significant scaling limitations. As a solution, deep neural networks were also proposed to approximate the densities comprising the agent’s generative model [1–6], allowing active inference to be scaled up to larger and more complex tasks.### DiscussionThe authors state: “The authors propose a deep active inference model that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs.
