### OverviewThis paper investigates the mapping of Husserlian phenomenology onto active inference. The authors state: “Phenomenology is the rigorous descriptive study of conscious experience.” They note: “Recent attempts to formalize Husserlian phenomenology provide us with a mathematical model of perception as a function of prior knowledge and expectation.” The paper argues: “We propose that key aspects of Husserl’s descriptions of consciousness can be mapped onto aspects of the generative models associated with the active inference approach.” The study demonstrates: “active inference is a corollary of the free energy principle in Bayesian mechanics.” The authors further claim: “active inference describes the dynamics (i.e., observable behavior) of things, so defined, as a path of least action, where the action is defined as time or path integral of an information theoretic quantity called self-information or, more simply, surprisal [7]–[11]. This quantity is also known as the negative log evidence in Bayesian inference.” This means that the paths of least action maximize model evidence—a normative behavior sometimes referred to as self-evidencing [12]. In many practical applications of active inference, we do not consider the surprisal directly as it is often computationally intractable, since it requires averaging over a potentially infinite amount of states. Instead we consider an upper bound on surprisal called “variational free energy” [13].### MethodologyThe authors explain: “Given the intended audience of this paper, we will only briefly review active inference.” They state: “Active inference is a process theory that can be used to model any physically separable, re-identifiable thing or particle, i.e., anything that persists as a coherent locus of states or paths, over some appreciable timescale.” The paper details: “Active inference describes the dynamics (i.e., observable behavior) of things, so defined, as a path of least action, where the action is defined as time or path integral of an information theoretic quantity called self-information or, more simply, surprisal [7]–[11]. This quantity is also known as the negative log evidence in Bayesian inference.” The study elaborates: “The free energy principle in Bayesian mechanics.” They note: “Active inference describes the dynamics (i.e., observable behavior) of things, so defined, as a path of least action, where the action is defined as time or path integral of an information theoretic quantity called self-information or, more simply, surprisal [7]–[11].
