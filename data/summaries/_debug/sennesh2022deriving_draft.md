### OverviewThis paper investigates deriving time-averaged active inference from control principles. The authors state: "active inference offers a principled account of behavior as minimizing average sensory surprise over time." They note: "Early ‘non-equilibrium steady’ formulations of active inference provided probability densities over full trajectories of movement and interaction [19,20]." According to the paper, this approach contrasts with a more recent formulation that uses fixed “prior preferences” [11]. The authors state: "The free energy principle, following the logic of active inference, says that organisms maintain their self-organization as a whole over time by avoiding surprising interactions between their internal and external environments [16]." The study demonstrates that a hierarchical generative model can unify motor active inference with decision active inference.### MethodologyThe authors explain that their formulation of active inference is based on minimizing path-entropy over an infinite time horizon. They state: "This formulation derives from the first principles of infinite-horizon, average-cost optimal control." The paper argues that this approach allows for reference states to vary according to their own generative model. The authors state: "The model employs a hierarchy of temporal scales, numbering these timescales from the shortest to the longest, while numbering random variables with discrete time-steps t∈1...T from left to right." The paper explains that the model uses a generative model to represent observable variables and latent variables. The authors state: "Like many generative models used to lay out active inference [27,42], this model employs a hierarchy of temporal scales."
