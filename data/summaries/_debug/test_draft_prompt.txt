=== FULL PAPER TEXT ===

Test Paper
This is a long scientific paper about machine learning with many details and explanations that cover various aspects of the field including algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics.
The paper presents novel methods for data analysis and optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods.


=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. Start with exact title: "Test Paper"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - Format each quote as: 'The authors state: "[exact quote from paper]"'
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
   - Each sentence and paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Do NOT use the same phrase multiple times (e.g., 'The authors state' should not appear 5+ times)
   - If you find yourself repeating content, STOP and write something NEW
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
