Okay, here’s a revised summary of the paper “Active Inference as a Model of Agency,” incorporating all the requested changes and aiming for a comprehensive and unique representation of the key findings and arguments.### Active Inference as a Model of AgencyThis paper presents a novel approach to understanding agency – active inference – as a model for how agents operate and make decisions. It argues that this approach, based on the principles of expected free energy and information-sensitivity, provides a more robust and accurate understanding of agency compared to traditional approaches.The core of the argument rests on two key features: information-sensitivity and risk-aversion.Firstly, the expected free energy, or a related information-gain, provides a way to value information.This means that the model actively seeks to incorporate new information into its understanding of the environment. Secondly, the model is inherently risk-averse, meaning it avoids choices that could lead to a significant loss of information or a substantial reduction in expected utility.This is reflected in the equation: −logP(a |h )=D (cid:2) P(s|a ,h )|P(s|h ) (cid:3) +E (cid:2) −logP(o|s,h ) (cid:3)The authors state: “The expected free energy, or a related information-gain, provides a way to value information.
