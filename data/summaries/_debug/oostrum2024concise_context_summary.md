A Concise Mathematical Description of Active
Inference in Discrete Time
Jesse van Oostrum, Carlotta Langer, Nihat Ay
Abstract
In this paper we present a concise mathematical descriptionof active
inference in discrete time. The main part of the paper serves as a ba-
sic introduction to the topic, including a detailed exampleof the action
selection mechanism. The appendix discusses the more subtle mathemat-
ical details, targeting readers who have already s...
