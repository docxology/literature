### An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click BehaviourThe authors state: "We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)." They note: "Pointing is a way of communicating information through an interface by manipulating a user-controlled cursor into spatial partitions corresponding to actions; typically, these are discrete actions like selecting a menu item." The paper argues: "Modelling pointing behaviour is crucial in engineering interactions well-suited to human capabilities, or in predicting the behaviour of users in using an existing interface." According to the research, "HCI has historically focused on high-level descriptive models of pointing using summary statistics." The study demonstrates: "Fitts’ Law is the classic model, and relates the expected time taken to acquire a target (with a certain tolerated error rate) to the size and distance of the target from the cursor origin." The authors state: “However, such models do not attempt to model the detailed process of target acquisition itself, and do not consider click dynamics.” They note: “Insights into complete cursor trajectories would enable more precise prediction of user intentions and the development of improved assistive tools.”The authors state: “To improve this understanding, we need to build a fine-grained, computational, generative model of the human user that synthesizes the entire target acquisition process.” They note: “Approaches to model whole pointing trajectories have been introduced, e.g. in [3,16,4,15,13], often with models derived from a control-theoretic perspective, such as the Minimum Jerk model [7] or the E-LQG [25].” They further note: “Other approaches have applied machine learning to derive policies that emulate human behaviour from data [1,2,10].” The study demonstrates: “These classical models typically rely on the design of cost or reward functions, which are often defined by a combination of the distance between the cursor and the target and the control effort required to reach it.” They note: “Furthermore, in contrast to our approach, these focus on cursor movement only and do not consider click dynamics.” The authors state: “AIF offers a fundamentally different perspective. An AIF formulation frames pointing as a continuous process of minimizing prediction error by continuously updating internal beliefs based on sensory input.” They note: “Active inference defines the goals of a (simulated) user in terms of a distribution over desired observations.” They further note: “Rather than moving the cursor exactly to the centre of the target, the user might be satisfied as long as there is a high chance of clicking the button correctly.”The authors state: “We propose an AIF model that is capable of modelling fine-grained pointing behaviour in this continuous setting, and which generalises to different tasks and environments.” They note: “The model has two main components, the arm dynamics and the finger dynamics, and an additional logic for mouse clicks.” They further note: “The general dynamics system is described by functions…” They state: “The agent controls the acceleration a that is applied to the cursor.” They note: “When moving a computer mouse over a desk in a reasonable area, there is no force pulling the mouse to a certain stable position. Therefore we decided to set the cursor’s stiffness to zero.” They state: “However, damping is still applied with a factor of d>0.” They note: “The finger dynamics is modelled by a First-Order Lag system with stiffness k >0.” They state: “A click is only initiated when the displacement applied to the mouse button exceeds a threshold, requiring the agent to release the button before being able to click again.” They note: “The agent has a preference distribution Pc, which is defined as…” They state: “The model is evaluated using a number of plans, N=3000.”The authors state: “We apply our model to investigate whether a cursor controlled with AIF:1. allows us to model mouse clicking based on probabilistic beliefs about the system and preference distributions over observations;2. shows similar variability to observed human movements; and3. can model the variety of behavioural strategies shown for different target difficulties without separately modelling each.” They note: “The model has two main components, the arm dynamics and the finger dynamics, and an additional logic for mouse clicks.” They state: “The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches.” They further note: “The model’s parameters are tuned to match human behaviour.”The authors state: “To model human pointing, we need to build a fine-grained, computational, generative model of the human user that synthesizes the entire target acquisition process.” They note: “Approaches to model whole pointing trajectories have been introduced, e.g. in [3,16,4,15,13], often with models derived from a control-theoretic perspective, such as the Minimum Jerk model [7] or the E-LQG [25].” They further note: “Other approaches have applied machine learning to derive policies that emulate human behaviour from data [1,2,10].” The study demonstrates: “These classical models typically rely on the design of cost or reward functions, which are often defined by a combination of the distance between the cursor and the target and the control effort required to reach it.” They note: “Furthermore, in contrast to our approach, these focus on cursor movement only and do not consider click dynamics.” The authors state: “AIF offers a fundamentally different perspective.
