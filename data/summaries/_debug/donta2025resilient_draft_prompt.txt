Abstract—Failures are the norm in highly complex and
heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing
continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge
nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring re-
liability and global consistency across these layers remains a
major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requir-
ing real-time, adaptive coordination. This work-in-progress
paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience
Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems.
PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing
a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults
while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov
blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously
healing issues through active inference. Through continuous
monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains
service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions.
Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness
of the proposed framework.

I. INTRODUCTION
N
O one can deny that computing infrastructure has
transformed dramatically with Generative AI, driv-
ing unprecedented demand for high-performance resources
spanning sensor nodes, edge devices, network elements,
and server clusters. In response, the distributed comput-
ing continuum (DCC) paradigm has emerged, orchestrating
complex tasks across the full device continuum, allocating
smaller, latency-sensitive tasks locally to reduce energy use
and preserve privacy, while offloading resource-intensive
tasks to high-performance servers [1], [2]. Such dynamic
task distribution optimizes resource use, balances energy
demand, and supports scalable operations. As the number
and diversity of devices increase, data volumes surge, and
workloads become more dynamic, system complexity con-
currently grows, intensifying failure risks [3]. In general,
task processing failures in the DCC occur due to factors
such as user-initiated aborts, incorrect inputs, insufficient
allocated resources, execution errors, node crashes, or com-
munication failures; In DCC, additional failures include
the unpredictability brought by device heterogeneity, mobile
and battery-dependent nodes, dynamic network and resource
shifts, and large-scale consistency challenges associated with
hundreds or thousands of edge devices.
Resilience mechanisms are crucial for modern computing
systems, since failures are the norm in these infrastructures.
The term resilience is chosen over mere fault tolerance in
DCC because these systems must not only tolerate discrete
faults but also effectively manage and adapt to a wide
range of inherent uncertainties [4], [5]. In DCC, resilience
reflects the system’s capability to sustain continuous oper-
ation through proactive adaptation, localized recovery, and
graceful degradation across diverse cloud, fog, edge, and IoT
layers, where unpredictable workload fluctuations, device
mobility, connectivity disruptions, and energy variability are
common [6], [7]. To achieve these, this paper designs a novel
probabilistic active inference resilience agent (PAIR-Agent),
with the following contributions.
•PAIR-Agent builds a probabilistic Causal Fault Graph
(CFG) using Bayesian Network Structure Learning
(BNSL) through various log data from the devices.
•Next, it uses the Markov blanket to identify potential
faults from CFGs. Further, PAIR-Agent applies the free
energy principle for uncertainty-aware fault inference.
•Finally, PAIR-Agent autonomously selects corrective
actions, minimizing expected free energy and enabling
self-healing through active inference.
II. SYSTEMMODEL
The DCC (S) are composed ofndevices including
one orccloud or data centersC={C 1, C2, ..., Cc},
a set offFog nodesF={F 1, F2, ..., Ff }, a set of
eEdge nodesE={E 1, E2, ..., Ee},mmobile devices
M={M 1, M2, ..., Mm}, a set ofιIoT devicesΓ =
{I1, I2, ..., Iι}, and a set ofςsensor nodes (SNs)Ψ =
{ψ1, ψ2, ..., ψς}. We assume thatΨare data producers and
they are not capable of computing any data. Therefore, they
transmit their data to the nearest base station, i.e.,Γ,M,
orEusing wireless communication through Bluetooth Low
Energy, Zigbee, Cellular, or Wi-Fi channels [8].
A set of AI-related computational tasks is defined as
T={T 1, T2, ..., Tt}, where each taskT i =⟨ω i, χi, ϕi, δi⟩
arXiv:2511.07202v2  [cs.DC]  18 Nov 2025
denotes workloadω i, input data dependenciesχ i, a compu-
tational mapping or model functionϕ i :χ i 7→y i, and an
execution deadlineδ i. The DCC graphS= (V,R)consists
of nodesV=C ∪ F ∪ E ∪ M ∪Γ∪Ψand communication
relationshipsR ⊆ V×V, where each nodevj ∈ Vexecutes a
subset of tasksT(v j)such that S
vj∈V T(v j) =T. Each task
executionT i(vj)follows a three-phase structure⟨α i, βi, γi⟩,
representing task initiation, computation, and completion or
checkpointing, respectively. In general, these complex AI
workflows, such as training, are composed of sequential sub-
tasks, e.g.,T train =T data-load ▷Tforward ▷Tbackward ▷Tupdate, where
each subtask can complete and save progress independently
to support partial recovery. Each task establishes a stable
checkpointζ i =⟨s i, Di, θi⟩, recording the intermediate state
si, processed dataset segmentD i, and model parametersθ i,
enabling restoration and continuation upon failure.
III. RESILIENCE INACTION
The proposed PAIR-Agent iteratively performs the follow-
ing steps (as depicted in Figure 1): (a) identifying changes
in the system logs and collecting data to generate a CFG;
(b) performing fault inference by determining certain and
uncertain faults using the Markov blanket and free energy
principle [9]; and (c) healing the faults through active
inference to achieve resilience, as discussed in more detail
in the subsequent subsections.
A. Collect and Process Logs
Initially, the PAIR-Agent coordinates distributed log ac-
quisition across theSusing remote procedure calls (RPCs)
to query each device(v i ∈ S)for its most recent checkpoint
(ζt
i =⟨s t
i, Dt
i, θt
i⟩), which encapsulates the local state, pro-
cessed dataset segment, and learned parameters at analysis
roundt. These checkpoints act as temporal anchors that
partition system observations into discrete analysis intervals,
allowing the agent to process only the log entries gener-
ated afterζ t
i . This design ensures synchronization across
heterogeneous nodes, prevents redundant ingestion of log
segments, tracks round-based progress, and maintains a glob-
ally consistent causal timeline of system activity [10]. Each
new round(t+ 1), therefore, begins with a synchronized
collection of incremental log updates∆L t+1
i , forming a
time-evolving dataset that supports continual inference.
After collection, raw logs are parsed and normalized into
a structured representation. PAIR-Agent extracts features
corresponding to potential fault interpretation or indicators,
including user-aborted tasks, resource allocation failures
(due to device mobility, computational capacity, or energy
level), node crashes, execution-time anomalies, data incon-
sistencies, and communication disruptions, among others.
Unlike traditional distributed systems, PAIR-Agent considers
each fault as a probabilistic eventf i embedded within a
continuous spatiotemporal context rather than an isolated de-
terministic failure. Eachf i is characterized by a conditional
probability distributionP(f i |x i, t), wherex i represents
contextual features extracted from the normalized log matrix
andtdenotes the checkpoint time window. This probabilistic
modeling allows the system to capture uncertainty and latent
dependencies among hardware, software, and environmental
factors influencing fault occurrence across heterogeneous
nodes.
To uncover causal dependencies among probabilistic
fault variables, PAIR-Agent constructs a time-evolving CFG
Gt+1
fault = (V t+1
f ,E t+1
f )using a BNSL. Here, each node
vi ∈ Vt+1
f represents a stochastic variable corresponding
to a specific fault or contextual feature extracted from the
normalized feature matrixX t+1, and each directed edge
eij ∈ Et+1
f encodes a conditional dependencyP t+1(vj |
Pa(vj)), where Pa(v j)denotes the parent set ofv j. This
structure is inferred incrementally at each checkpoint interval
(t, t+ 1], allowing PAIR-Agent to integrate newly observed
evidence∆D t+1 while retaining prior knowledge from ear-
lier analysis rounds. This is achieved through Hill-Climbing
with Bayesian Dirichlet equivalence scoring [11], combined
with probabilistic regularization to handle noise and partial
observability in DCC data. In scenarios with strong nonlin-
earity or non-stationary correlations, PAIR-Agent employs
variational Bayesian learners to refine causal relations across
checkpoints adaptively [12]. Each updated Bayesian network
Gt+1
fault represents the posterior belief over causal structure
given new observations, expressed asP t+1(Gfault | Dt+1)∝
P(Dt+1 | Gfault)P t(Gfault),whereP t(Gfault)encodes the
prior structural belief accumulated from previous rounds.
B. Fault Inference
Building upon the Bayesian CFGG t+1
fault , PAIR-Agent per-
forms probabilistic fault inference by exploiting the local
Markov properties of the network. For each fault variable
fi ∈ Vt+1
f , the agent defines its Markov blanketM(f i) =
Pa(fi)∪Ch(f i)∪Pa(Ch(f i)), where Pa(f i)and Ch(f i)
denote the parent and child sets off i, respectively [13].
This blanket represents the minimal sufficient set of variables
that renderf i conditionally independent from the rest of the
network. By monitoring the probabilistic interactions within
M(fi), the agent computes the posterior probability of fault
activation or propagation, i.e.
Pt+1(fi | M(fi))∝P t+1(fi |Pa(f i))
×
Y
cj∈Ch(fi)
Pt+1(cj |Pa(c j)).
At each checkpoint interval(t, t+1], the agent continuously
updates these beliefs using newly collected evidence∆Dt+1.
Since the exact computation of posteriors is generally infea-
sible for complex distributions, PAIR-Agent integrates free
energy minimization with the Bayesian CFG and Markov
blanket structure to infer approximate posterior beliefs. It
utilizes the free energy principle (FEP) [13] to continuously

Markov blanket and FEP analysis, and heals through active inference to restore system stability.
align its internal model with observed system behavior. At
each checkpointt+ 1, the agent computes an approximate
posterior beliefQ t+1(f)by minimizing the variational free
energy, defined as
Ft+1 ≜E Qt+1(f)
h
lnQ t+1(f)−lnP t+1(f,x t+1)
i
,
whereQ t+1(f)approximates the posterior belief over the
faultsf={f i}i, given the contextual featuresx t+1 =
{xt+1
i }i. MinimizingF t+1 updates these beliefs, refining
the agent’s estimates under model uncertainty and capturing
dependencies among faults.
To further refine fault-type attribution, PAIR-Agent par-
titions the inferred fault space into hardware-related and
software-related components,V t+1
f =V t+1
HW ∪ Vt+1
SW . The
hardware setV t+1
HW captures physical and low-level opera-
tional indicators—such as temperature variations [14], power
fluctuations, and connectivity degradation—while the soft-
ware setV t+1
SW represents task failures, model divergence, re-
source contention, and execution-time anomalies. Using this
decomposition, PAIR-Agent performs conditional marginal-
ization to obtainP t+1(fi | Vt+1
HW )andP t+1(fi | Vt+1
SW ),
which enables the agent to differentiate whether a detected
fault most likely originates from hardware-level disturbances
or software-driven inconsistencies. Importantly, this stage
performs onlyfault inference; the subsequent step handles
all decision-making and recovery actions based on these
inferred fault states.
C. Active Inference for Healing
Once fault inference identifies faults, PAIR-Agent em-
ploys active inference [15] to autonomously plan and execute
corrective actions. The agent evaluates a set of possible
actionsa t ∈ Aand selects the one that minimizes the
expected free energyG(·):
a∗
t = arg min
at
G(at).
The expected free energy for actiona t is given by
G(at)≜D KL(Qt+1(x|a t)∥P ∗(x))
+E Qt+1(f|at)[H[P(x|f)]],
whereP ∗(x)encodes the preferred contextual features,
Qt+1(f|a t)denotes the predicted posterior belief about
the faults under actiona t,P(x|f)is the likelihood
of observing the contextual features, given faults, and
Qt+1(x|a t)≜ P
f Qt+1(f|a t)P(x|f)is the
predictive distribution over future contextual features under
actiona t. By minimizingG(a t), PAIR-Agent selects actions
that steer the system toward its preferred operational state
while explicitly accounting for uncertainty in both hardware-
level indicators (V t+1
HW ) and software-level behavioral vari-
ables (V t+1
SW ). After executing the selected action, PAIR-
Agent observes the resulting system state, updates posterior
fault probabilitiesP t+1(fi |x t+1
i )with new evidence,
and advances the checkpointζ t+1 to record the updated
configuration and belief state. This closed-loop cycle of
perception–inference–action–updateenables continual adap-
tation and resilience across analysis rounds. During the
healing process, PAIR-Agent not only redistributes tasks
but also performs device-level recovery through automated
reinitialization, firmware reloading, or adaptive configuration
tuning. If such self-healing measures fail to restore stability,
the agent isolates the faulty node and applies corrective
actions at the continuum levelS, including workload re-
distribution across fog or cloud layers, rerouting through
redundant network paths, managing dynamic load or thermal
management, and escalation to human operators for physical
interventions.
IV. THEORETICALRESULTS ANDDISCUSSIONS
This section presents the theoretical foundations show-
ing how PAIR-Agent achieves resilient operation in the
DCC through principled probabilistic inference and cautious,
uncertainty-aware action selection. The results highlight four
key properties: the locality and scalability of fault inference,
the quality of the variational posterior approximation, the
safety of the agent’s corrective actions, and the robustness
of belief updates under missing or delayed logs.
Result 1 (Locality and Scalability of Fault Inference).
For any fault variablef i, PAIR-Agent only needs the vari-
ables in its Markov blanketM(f i)(its parents, children, and
co-parents) to update the beliefQ(f i). Thus, the time and
memory per fault update depend on|M(f i)|, and not on the
total number of variables in the CFG. If the average blanket
size isB, updating alldfaults in one round costsO(d·B),
which stays manageable as the DCC grows, provided local
neighborhoods stay small. This guarantees that the pipeline
in Fig. 1 scales due to inference being local by design.
Result 2 (Best Possible Approximate Posterior).At
checkpointt+1, PAIR-Agent selectsQ t+1(f)by minimizing
the variational free energyF t+1(Q). Since,F t+1(Q)differs
fromD KL(Q(f)∥P t+1(f|x t+1))only by a constant in-
dependent ofQ(i.e.,−lnP t+1(xt+1)), the updateQ t+1 =
arg minQ∈Q Ft+1(Q)is equivalently the closest distribution
to the exact Bayesian posterior within the chosen variational
familyQ. Therefore, given the current CFG and log data,
PAIR-Agent computes the best posterior approximation it
can represent, ensuring principled and internally consistent
fault inference.
Result 3 (Conservative Action Selection [Never Worse
Than Doing Nothing]).Assume that the action set includes
a baseline ”do nothing” actiona ∅, which keeps the current
system configuration. Then, because PAIR-Agent selects
a∗
t = arg minat G(at), the chosen action never has higher
expected free energy thana ∅. Conversely, when an action
is predicted to moveQ(x|a)closer to preferences and/or
reduce uncertainty, it will be selected. This guarantees that
the agent will not take an action that it predicts will diverge
the system from its operational objectives and not increase
its model certainty.
Result 4 (Robustness to Missing or Delayed Logs).At
checkpointt+ 1, the belief update for any faultf i depends
only on variables in its Markov blanketM(f i). Therefore,
missing or delayed logs for variables outsideM(f i)do not
change the updated beliefQ t+1(fi). Since telemetry in DCC
is often partial or out-of-order, this property makes PAIR-
Agent’s inference insensitive to unrelated data gaps and
supports asynchronous, scalable updates: only logs inside the
small local neighborhoodM(f i)can affect the diagnosis of
fi.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper introduced the PAIR-Agent as a unified frame-
work for achieving resilience in DCC systems. The PAIR-
Agent agent performs: (i) constructing a CFG through
device log analysis, (ii) identifying faults while managing
uncertainties using Markov blankets and the FEP, and (iii)
autonomously healing issues via active inference. Through
its closed-loop cycle of observation, inference, and action,
PAIR-Agent ensures adaptive stability, self-healing capabil-
ity, and sustained operational continuity, marking a signif-
icant step toward autonomous and resilient DCC systems.
Theoretical results confirm its scalability, principled and
accurate fault inference, safe decision-making, and robust-
ness to incomplete telemetry. Future work will extend this
research with detailed and distributed implementation, em-
pirical validation, and evaluation under a real-time testbed.
