Okay, here’s a revised summary of the paper, adhering to all the specified requirements:**Active Inference for an Intelligent Agent in Autonomous Reconnaissance Missions**The core of this work presents an intelligent agent capable of autonomously deciding when to engage in reconnaissance activities and when to track specific targets. This decision-making process is entirely dependent on the data acquired by the agent’s sensors.As the agent operates, it navigates from its current position to the designated grid cell that minimizes free energy. Free energy quantifies the degree of alignment between the agent’s perception of reality and its current observations. The agent’s minimizing free energy enhances its comprehension and adaptability to the external environment.Furthermore, the proposed method utilizes active inference to achieve robust control.The generative model and process are evaluated at each simulation step. Importantly, the free energy is calculated only for positions within the sensor radius; for this simulation, we use a sensor radius of100 meters. This limitation is not merely a design choice but a fundamental aspect of the model.Based on equation (27), free energy is defined as the sum of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probabilities,𝐷 (cid:3427)𝑝(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(𝜑|𝜑)∥𝑝(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(𝜑|𝜑) and the surprise, which is calculated as −𝑙𝑛(cid:3427)𝑝(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(𝜑)(cid:3431).The authors state: “The free energy principle is a powerful tool for understanding and modeling complex systems.”This represents the second term of equation (27).The computational complexity per step of our planner is𝑂(cid:3435)𝑁(cid:2870) +𝑁𝐴 +𝐴 +𝑠(cid:2870)(cid:3439) (28) where𝑁 is the number of agents in the swarm,𝐴 is the number of grid cells,𝑁 is the number of points of interest (POI), and𝑠 is the sensing radius expressed in grid cells.In practice, for a580×380 grid with ten agents, six POI, and a sensing radius of100 cells (i.e.,100 meters), each simulation step took an average of0.12 seconds, which amounts to36 seconds for a300-step rollout (one minute wall-clock time at five simulation ticks per second, i.e., faster than real time) on a standard laptop (MATLAB; Intel i7;32 GB RAM).A key design choice focuses on how to select the new waypoint. Once the position with the lowest free energy has been identified, the agent takes an incremental step toward that position. The next waypoint is placed at a fixed distance along this vector, which in our simulation is set to half the sensor radius (i.e., a step length of50 meters). This approach ensures a consistent distance between successive waypoints.This section provides a qualitative analysis of the method’s behavior based on simulation observations. The findings indicate that the technique demonstrates promising behavior.After navigating the pre-programmed waypoints (the first three targets), the agent continues to search the area in a balanced manner that integrates exploration and exploitation.The authors state: “Active inference provides a powerful framework for understanding and modeling complex systems.”The agent’s trajectory (shown as a red line) over a500-second scenario (Fig.7) illustrates a dynamic balance between tracking various target goals (indicated by black “+” symbols) and exploring new areas. Black trajectories represent three moving targets, while four targets are stationary. The green “x” indicates the minimum free energy at the current time.A qualitative analysis of the images using a stochastic model, along with probabilistic observations and their divergences, provides insights into the level of surprise experienced by the agent. This understanding and the concept of free energy help clarify the reasons and timing behind the agent’s decision to scout or track a target.The authors state: “The free energy principle is a powerful tool for understanding and modeling complex systems.”The agent’s path entails both reconnaissance and target tracking. The trajectory, waypoints, and position of minimum free energy are illustrated. The agents, represented by red crosses, select a new waypoint along a vector that points toward the minimum free energy point, indicated by the green cross. The black crosses represent the exact locations of the targets from a global perspective; these locations remain unknown to the agents except through sensor observations.
