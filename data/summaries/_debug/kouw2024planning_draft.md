Okay, here’s a summary of the paper “Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to non-linear sensors in active inference agents” based on the provided text.### OverviewThis paper investigates a method for active inference agents to plan trajectories while avoiding ambiguous states. The core idea is to utilize Gaussian approximations to non-linear sensors, recognizing that measurement functions often introduce significant non-linearity. The authors demonstrate that Gaussian approximations, particularly those incorporating second-order Taylor expansions, induce state-dependent ambiguity terms, effectively guiding the agent to avoid states where the estimation of the state is difficult. The research is experimentally validated using a robot navigation task, highlighting the importance of considering sensor non-linearity when designing active inference systems.### MethodologyThe study employs a generative model based on active inference, characterized by a linear Gaussian state-space model. The model incorporates a non-linear measurement function, *g(x )*, which transforms states into observations. The research explores three Gaussian approximations to this non-linear function: a first-order Taylor approximation, a second-order Taylor approximation, and the unscented transform. The first-order Taylor approximation results in a constant ambiguity term, while the second-order Taylor approximation and the unscented transform induce non-constant ambiguity terms dependent on the curvature of the measurement function. The experimental setup involves a robot navigating a plane, with the robot’s state defined as its planar position and time derivatives. The robot’s sensors measure relative angle and distance, and the robot’s control input is determined by minimizing the expected free energy using a model predictive control objective.### ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate that the agent with the second-order Taylor approximation (EFE2) is able to plan a trajectory to the goal with greater accuracy than the agent with the first-order Taylor approximation (EFE1). The agent with the second-order Taylor approximation also outperforms the agent with the unscented transform. The authors show that the ambiguity term in the second-order Taylor approximation is dependent on the curvature of the measurement function, and that the agent avoids states where the curvature is high. The authors demonstrate that the robot’s trajectory is more volatile when using the first-order Taylor approximation, and that the robot’s trajectory is smoother when using the second-order Taylor approximation. The authors show that the robot loses track of the goal when approaching the sensor station using the first-order Taylor approximation.### DiscussionThe authors state: "The results show that the ambiguity term in the second-order Taylor approximation induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation." They note: "This suggests that active inference agents should consider the non-linearities of their sensors when planning trajectories." The paper argues: "The second-order Taylor approximation is more sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, which is a key factor in determining the accuracy of state estimation." The authors state: "The results show that the ambiguity term in the second-order Taylor approximation induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation." They note: "The second-order Taylor approximation leads to a more accurate representation of the sensor’s behavior." The paper argues: "The second-order Taylor approximation is more sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, which is a key factor in determining the accuracy of state estimation."---**Note:** This summary is based *solely* on the provided text.
