Real-World Robot Control by Deep Active Inference
with a Temporally Hierarchical World Model
Kentaro Fujii1 and Shingo Murata 1
Abstract— Robots in uncertain real-world environments must
perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However,
most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration
and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt
deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human
goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep
active infer...
