=== REVISE TO ===
PROFESSIONAL TONE: Begin directly with content - NO conversational openings like 'Okay, here's...'

1. Fix all issues above
2. Title: "Test Paper"
3. Include 10-15 quotes from paper text
   - Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
   - FIX SPACING ISSUES FROM PDF EXTRACTION:
     * PDF extraction may remove spaces between words (e.g., 'dynamicssimulationsand' → 'dynamics simulations and')
     * When extracting quotes, restore missing spaces between words if they appear concatenated
     * Look for patterns like 'word1word2word3' and add spaces: 'word1 word2 word3'
     * This is a common issue from PDF text extraction that needs correction
   - Use consistent quote formatting: 'The authors state: "quote"' or vary attribution phrases
   - Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition
   - CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
4. ELIMINATE ALL REPETITION - each sentence must be unique
   - Check before each sentence: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary attribution phrases - do NOT repeat 'The authors state' multiple times
5. Extract methodology, results with numbers, key quotes
6. 1000-1500 words, structured with ### headers
