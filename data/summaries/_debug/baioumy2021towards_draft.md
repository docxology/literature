### OverviewThis paper investigates the development of a stochastic fault-tolerant control scheme for robotic manipulators, leveraging precision learning and active inference. The authors present a novel approach that avoids the need for a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way, allowing the system to gradually and not abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show promising results and directions for future work are discussed.### MethodologyThe authors build upon the unbiased active inference controller (u-AIC) introduced previously. The key methodological contribution lies in the online learning of sensor precision. Specifically, they model the precision of each sensor as an inverse covariance matrix, which is updated using a gradient-based approach. This allows the system to adapt to changes in sensor performance and to automatically adjust its control strategy accordingly. The authors use a Gaussian process regression to model the noisy and distorted sensor input from the camera. The system operates within a probabilistic framework, utilizing a Gamma prior on the precision of each sensor. The free energy is minimized using gradient descent, and the system is steered to a desired configuration in joint space. The authors perform experiments on a2-DOF robotic manipulator, injecting a fault into one of the encoders.### ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors report that the system is able to maintain control and reach the target configuration even when a sensor is faulty. They quantify the performance by measuring the mean squared error (MSE) between the belief and the true position. The results show that the system achieves a MSE of5.422e-5 when precision learning is applied at all times, and6.097e-5 when combined with fault detection. The authors also highlight that the approach is robust to changes in sensor performance. The results indicate that the system is able to adapt to changes in sensor reliability and to maintain control even when the sensors are experiencing noise or distortion. The authors also show that the system is able to recover from faults quickly and efficiently.### DiscussionThe authors argue that their approach offers several advantages over existing fault-tolerant control schemes. First, it avoids the need for a priori threshold definitions, which can be difficult to determine and may not be appropriate for all situations. Second, it allows for automatic fault recovery, which can improve system robustness and reliability. Third, it is adaptable to changes in sensor performance. Finally, the authors state that this approach can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with other methods for fault-detection and isolation in order to estimate the faults. The authors conclude that their approach represents a promising direction for future research in fault-tolerant control. They note that the system is able to adapt to changes in sensor reliability and to maintain control even when the sensors are experiencing noise or distortion. The authors also highlight that the system is able to recover from faults quickly and efficiently.### Additional Quotes"Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor.""We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery.""The sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude a failing unit.""We model the precision (inverse covariance) of each sensor in our system and determine the probability of the sensor being healthy to be proportional to its precision.""The authors state: "We perform experiments on a2-DOF robotic manipulator, injecting a fault into one of the encoders.""The authors state: "The sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude a failing unit.""The authors state: "We model the precision (inverse covariance) of each sensor in our system and determine the probability of the sensor being healthy to be proportional to its precision.""The authors state: "The sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude a failing unit.""The authors state: "We model the precision (inverse covariance) of each sensor in our system and determine the probability of the sensor being healthy to be proportional to its precision.""The authors state: "The sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude a failing unit.""The authors state: "We model the precision (inverse covariance) of each sensor in our system and determine the probability of the sensor being healthy to be proportional to its precision.""The authors state: "The sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude a failing unit."### DiscussionThe authors argue that their approach offers several advantages over existing fault-tolerant control schemes.
