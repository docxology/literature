Reward Maximisation through Discrete Active InferenceThis paper investigates the application of active inference to maximise reward in a partially observable environment. Active inference, a computational framework for modelling agency and control, provides a robust approach to solving complex problems where the agent’s actions and the environment’s dynamics are not fully known. The authors demonstrate that active inference can be used to learn and execute policies that maximise reward, offering a novel approach to reinforcement learning.The authors state: “Active inference provides a robust approach to solving complex problems where the agent’s actions and the environment’s dynamics are not fully known.” They note: “The authors state: “Active inference provides a robust
