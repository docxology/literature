Here's a summary of the paper "Deep Active Inference for Pixel-Based Discrete Control: Evaluation on the Car Racing Problem" by Niels van Hoeffelen and Pablo Lanillos, adhering to all your instructions.### OverviewThis paper investigates the potential of deep active inference (DAIF) for controlling a car racing environment, where the agent has no access to the car’s internal state. The research focuses on learning a control policy from high-dimensional visual input, a challenging task for artificial agents. The authors demonstrate that DAIF can achieve comparable performance to deep Q-learning, but doesn’t yet reach state-of-the-art results. The core idea is to minimize the expected free energy, a key concept in active inference, which models the brain’s predictive process.### MethodologyThe DAIF agent was implemented to tackle OpenAI’s car racing benchmark. The system utilizes five deep neural networks to approximate the densities of observation encoding and decoding, the state transition, the policy, and the value. The observation network encodes the high-dimensional input (96x96 RGB) into a latent state representation. The transition network models the evolution of the state over time, while the policy network determines the action to take based on the current state. The value network estimates the expected free energy. The agent employs a replay memory with a batch size of250 and a freeze period for the target network to stabilize learning. The system uses a discrete action space, discretized into11 actions.### ResultsThe DAIF agent’s performance was compared to that of a deep Q-learning (DQN) agent and a random agent. The average reward over100 episodes showed that the DAIF agent achieved a reward of494 ±241, while the DQN agent achieved515 ±162. The authors highlight that the DAIF agent’s performance was on par with the DQN agent, but it didn’t reach the performance of state-of-the-art world model approaches. The slower learning curve of the DAIF agent is attributed to the need to learn the world model.### DiscussionThe authors conclude that while DAIF shows promise for pixel-based control, it currently doesn’t outperform other world model approaches. They identify limitations in the current implementation and suggest potential architectures to overcome these challenges. Specifically, the slower learning curve is attributed to the need to learn the underlying dynamics of the environment. The authors suggest exploring alternative architectures to improve the agent’s ability to learn and adapt to the complex car racing environment.---**Key Quotes from the
