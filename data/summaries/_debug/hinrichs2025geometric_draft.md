### Geometric Hyperscanning of Affect under Active InferenceThis paper investigates the dynamic interplay between affect and social cognition, modeling it as coupled active inference with affect emerging as recursive inference over identity-relevant surprise. Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks deviations from expected states, modulating this process through temporal aiming – the agent’s orientation across past and future affective states. We introduce geometric hyperscanning, a method for operationalizing these dynamics by tracking topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, utilizing the entropy of these reconfigurations as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.### Key Claims & Arguments1.“Social understanding is not computed about another agent, but emerges while in social interaction with another through recursive belief updating.” – This central claim establishes the core mechanism of the model: social cognition arises from the continuous, iterative process of updating beliefs within a dyadic system.2.“Affective valence reflects the agent’s appraisal of ongoing interaction, shaped by self-model coherence and predictive error.” – This statement defines the operationalization of affect within the model, linking it directly to the accuracy of the self-model in predicting and explaining the observed interaction.3.“The authors propose that FRc captures the degree of network connectivity and flow.” – This highlights the methodological core of the approach, framing FRc as a measurable indicator of the dynamic interplay between the agents.4.“The authors state: ‘The authors state: “X”. They further note: “Y”. The paper argues: “Z”. – This statement is a summary of the key arguments presented in the paper.### Results & Methodological ApproachThe core of the paper’s contribution lies in the development and application of geometric hyperscanning. This method utilizes the Forman-Ricci curvature (FRc) to quantify the topological changes in inter-brain networks during social interaction. Specifically, the FRc is calculated as the entropy of these network changes, providing a measure of the degree of phase transitions, such as rupture (disruption of synchrony), co-regulation (synchronized adjustment of network states), and re-attunement (return to a stable, aligned state). The model demonstrates that FRc values increase during periods of rupture and decrease during periods of co-regulation, providing a quantifiable measure of these dynamic processes.### Future Directions & ImplicationsThe proposed framework offers a scalable architecture for modeling recursive affective dynamics across psychotherapy, development, and naturalistic interaction. By integrating FRc as a key metric, the model provides a novel approach to understanding and quantifying the complex interplay between affect and social cognition. Further research could explore the application of this framework to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior and the development of social skills.
