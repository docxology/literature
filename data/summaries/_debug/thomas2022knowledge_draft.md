Okay, let’s begin. I will meticulously extract and synthesize the information from the provided paper, adhering strictly to the instructions above.### OverviewThis paper, “Knowledge as Fruits of Ignorance: A global Free Energy Principle of our way of thinking,” presents a novel approach to understanding cognition by framing it within the framework of constrained ignorance and the free energy principle. The authors argue that our understanding of the world arises not from absolute knowledge, but from a constant minimization of ignorance, guided by probabilistic reasoning. The paper’s core argument is that a person’s journey of learning can be modeled as a dynamic process of updating beliefs, driven by a fundamental drive to reduce uncertainty.### MethodologyThe authors utilize a simplified model of Howard’s learning experience to illustrate their concepts. Howard’s journey begins with a state of complete ignorance (Z0) and progresses through a series of updates (Z1, Z2, Z3, etc.) as he encounters new information and experiences. The model is built around the constrained Shannon entropy, where the goal is to minimize the entropy (a measure of uncertainty) associated with Howard’s beliefs. The key mathematical operations involve calculating probabilities and applying the constraints to update Howard’s knowledge. The authors explicitly use the term “constrained Shannon’s entropy” as a central concept. The model is based on the idea that the system is constantly minimizing its free energy, which is equivalent to minimizing its ignorance.### Results & ClaimsThe authors demonstrate that Howard’s journey can be described by a series of probabilistic updates. Specifically, they show that Howard’s initial state of ignorance (Z0) is characterized by a probability of1 for the proposition that “things exist” (E0). As Howard interacts with his environment, he updates his beliefs, leading to the emergence of new propositions (E1, E2, EM). The authors state that “P (E1∩ E2) = P (E2∩ E1)”, which means that the probabilities of E1 and E2 are equal, and that the system is in a state of equilibrium. They also show that the probability of E1, E2 and EM are all equal to1/3, and that the system is in a state of equilibrium. The authors state that “The authors state: “P (E1∩ E2) = P (E2∩ E1)”, which means that the probabilities of E1 and E2 are equal, and that the system is in a state of equilibrium.The authors also show that the probability of E1, E2 and EM are all equal to1/3, and that the system is in a state of equilibrium.
