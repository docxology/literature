Active Inference in Contextual Multi-Armed
Bandits for Autonomous Robotic Exploration
Shohei Wakayama1, Alberto Candela 2, Paul Hayne 3, and Nisar Ahmed 1
Abstract—Autonomous selection of optimal options for data
collection from multiple alternatives is challenging in uncertain
environments. When secondary information about options is ac-
cessible, such problems can be framed as contextual multi-armed
bandits (CMABs). Neuro-inspired active in...
