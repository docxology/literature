### OverviewThis paper investigates the processes of tool discovery and tool innovation using the framework of active inference. The authors articulate a distinction between these concepts, defining tool discovery as the incidental repetition of actions while tool innovation involves constructing novel tools independently, without relying on social demonstration. The research employs a probabilistic generative model to simulate agent behavior, exploring how agents can learn to solve tasks by inducing appropriate tool properties. The study highlights the importance of incorporating affordances into the agent’s model to facilitate one-shot generalization to novel situations.### MethodologyThe authors utilize a discrete-state space model based on partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to simulate agent behavior. The generative model incorporates two factors representing the hidden states: room state and tool state. The model is implemented using the Python package pymdp, which allows for efficient Bayesian inference. The agents are equipped with a uniform prior distribution over the transition likelihoods, representing an initial lack of knowledge about the environment. The experiment involves placing the reward in one of the possible reward locations and allowing the agent to interact with the environment for a fixed number of time steps. The key methodological innovation lies in the incorporation of tool affordances into the generative model, enabling the agent to learn the appropriate tool properties through induction.### ResultsThe experiments demonstrate that the agent can successfully solve the task of retrieving the reward by using the tools provided, regardless of the reward location. When the generative model is perfectly known, the agent solves the task optimally, highlighting the ability to leverage existing knowledge. The agent can discover the correct tools and learn to solve the task when it is not provided with this information in its model a priori.

They then ground this work with the construction of a simple model in order to take seriously this distinction and see what insight can be drawn. They provide the first evidence for the necessary properties associated with the process of tool innovation: namely that of offline induction of appropriate tool structure through composing relevant affordances.### ConclusionOverall, we have provided a minimal description of the distinction between tool discovery and tool innovation under the formalismofactive inference.Wehaveusedthistothenexplore asimplemodelof toolinnovationinan AIFagent byintroducinga factorisationofhiddenstates ofthegenerativemodelintoaffordances.Thisparticularstructuralchoiceaffordstheagentwiththeabilitytogeneralisewhatit haslearnedaboutstatetransitionsandconceptualiseasuitabletoolviaaprocessofinduction.Wehave discussedtheimplicationsandlimitationsofourresultsandoutlineddirectionsforfurtherresearch.
