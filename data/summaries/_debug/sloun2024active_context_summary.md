Active inference and deep generative modeling
for cognitive ultrasound
Ruud JG van Sloun Member, IEEE
Abstract— Ultrasound has the unique potential to offer ac-
cess to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices
have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the
stethoscope. Nevertheless, and despite many advances,
ultrasound image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still
highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-
image patients, i...
