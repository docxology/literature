## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Claim:** The paper introduces a novel framework for predicting the evolution of a system, combining elements of model order reduction and deep learning.
    **Hypothesis:**  This combined approach can accurately predict the evolution of a system, capturing both deterministic and stochastic aspects.

2.  **Claim:** The core of the framework relies on a variational approach to approximate the complex dynamics of the system.
    **Hypothesis:**  This approach can effectively capture the essential features of the system’s evolution, providing a reasonable approximation of the true dynamics.

3.  **Claim:** The framework leverages a deep neural network to learn the mapping between the system’s state variables and its evolution, capturing both deterministic and stochastic aspects.
    **Hypothesis:** The deep neural network can effectively learn the mapping between the system’s state variables and its evolution, capturing both deterministic and stochastic aspects.
