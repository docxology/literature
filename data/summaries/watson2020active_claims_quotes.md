Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The primary claim is that active inference (AI) can be framed as partially-observed control as inference (CaI), offering a more principled and robust approach compared to traditional AI formulations.
2.  The authors hypothesize that the ELBO, central to AI, is fundamentally a likelihood objective that can be directly translated into a control problem.
3.  The paper proposes that incorporating the free energy principle into a control framework provides a unified approach to state estimation and control.
4.  The authors suggest that the linear Gaussian inference framework, combined with approximate inference techniques, can effectively address the challenges of nonlinear control problems.
5.  The paper posits that the i2c approach (input inference for control) offers a direct link between Bayesian filtering and optimal control, providing a more intuitive understanding of the underlying principles.
6.  The authors propose that the free energy principle can be used to define a cost function that directly relates to the distance between desired and observed states.

“We show that AI may be framed as partially-observedCaIwhenthecostfunctionisdefinedspecificallyintheobservation states.” – *In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"* (This quote establishes the core argument: AI can be viewed as a specific case of CaI when the cost function is defined in terms of observation states.)

“Minimizing the KL divergence, e.g. minD [q || p] w.r.t. θ.” – *In Section 2.2, the authors state: "quote text"* (This quote describes the variational inference method, a key component of the approach.)

“The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?” – *Friston, K. (2010). Nature reviews neuroscience (2010).* (This quote references the foundational work of Friston, highlighting the free-energy principle as a central concept.)

“We propose that the i2c approach (input inference for control) offers a direct link between Bayesian filtering and optimal control, providing a more intuitive understanding of the underlying principles.” – *In the Discussion, the authors state: "quote text"* (This quote summarizes the key contribution of the i2c approach.)
