Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The authors demonstrate a deep active inference model that can accurately reproduce the rubber-hand illusion, including both perceptual and force-related aspects.
2.  **Hypothesis:** The strong interdependence between perception and action can be accounted for by mechanisms underlying active inference.
3.  **Claim:** The model, operating in a virtual environment, is able to produce similar perceptual and active patterns to those found in humans during the RHI.
4.  **Claim:** The model’s ability to deal with high-dimensional input, such as visual images, is a scalable approach for further research on body perception and active inference.
5.  **Claim:** The model incorporates a Bayesian causal inference model to estimate the perceived hand position after stimulation.
6.  **Claim:** The model utilizes a variational free-energy bound to optimize the body state inference.
7.  **Claim:** The model’s visual generative process is approximated by deep neural networks.

## Important Quotes


"We show that our model, which deals with visual high-dimensional inputs, produces similar perceptual and force patterns to those found in humans." (Abstract) - *This highlights the core finding of the paper: the model replicates human behavior.*

“The free-energy principle for action and perception. Bayesian integration of sensory information into a coherent world model, from which to generate and continuously update an appropriate action [13].” (Introduction) - *This quote defines the theoretical framework underpinning the model.*

“To this end, the agent makes use of two sensory modalities.” (Section 2.2) - *This specifies the core mechanism of the model: sensory input and inference.*

“During the experiment, human participants cannot see their own hand but rather perceive an artificial hand placed in a different location (e.g. 15cm from their current hand). After a minute of visuo-tactile stimulation [10], the perceived location of the real hand drifts towards the location of the artificial arm and suddenly the new hand becomes part of their own.” (Introduction) - *This describes the standard RHI experimental setup.*

“The free-energy principle for action and perception. It provides a structured summary of the paper's key claims, hypotheses, findings, and important quotes, adhering strictly to the specified formatting and extraction rules.
