## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference is a framework for understanding cognition and behavior as a process of generating and updating beliefs about the causes of sensory experience"
*   Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (rSLDS) (exact quote from paper) – “rSLDS discover meaningful discrete representations of complex continuous dynamics via piecewise linear decomposition”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is used to optimise the parameters of the neural networks”
*   Laplace Variational Expectation Maximisation (EM) (exact quote from paper) – “Laplace Variational Expectation Maximisation is used to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent states”
*   Discrete Markov Decision Process (MDP) (exact quote from paper) – “the discrete planning problem is formulated as a standard POMDP generative model”
*   Piecewise Affine (PWA) System (exact quote from paper) – “the system is approximated using a piecewise affine model”
