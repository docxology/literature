Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Subsumption Thesis:** The paper’s central claim is that expected utility theory, as commonly applied in economics, is subsumed by active inference – it’s an “edge case” and can be reduced to a more fundamental framework.
2.  **Formal Bridge:** The authors propose to establish a “formal bridge” between microeconomics and active inference, aiming to provide a more comprehensive account of agency.
3.  **ITBR as a Key Tool:** The paper argues that Information-Theoretic Bounded Rationality (ITBR) provides a crucial framework for comparing and contrasting expected utility and active inference.
4.  **POMDPs as a Testbed:** The research utilizes Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) as a formal setting to evaluate the claims regarding agency.
5.  **Agency Defined by Free Energy:** The paper posits that an agent’s agency is defined by minimizing the expected free energy, a core concept in active inference.
6.  **Hypothesis: Active Inference Offers a More Realistic Model:** The authors hypothesize that active inference provides a more realistic model of agency by incorporating the agent’s active role in shaping its environment and perceptions.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "As a unified theory of sentient behaviour, active inference is formally intertwined with multiple normative theories of optimal behaviour."
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote establishes the overarching goal of the paper – to integrate active inference with existing theories of agency.

**Quote:** "To formally compare the two accounts of agency, we require a commensurable space for agent-environment interactions: MDPs and POMDPs (Definition 1 and 2)."
**Context:** 2 Introduction
**Significance:** This quote highlights the methodological approach – using MDPs and POMDPs as a common ground for comparison.

**Quote:** "The comprehensive start of this lineage can be traced to the classic utility theorem [24]; [8], with earlier applications found in [31]."
**Context:** 1 Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the historical context of expected utility theory, highlighting its roots in Bernoulli’s work.

**Quote:** "To investigate the subsumption thesis, the rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section2. the agent-environment frameworks are defined alongside the relevant accounts of agency and basic concepts in microeconomics."
**Context:** 1 Introduction
**Significance:** This quote outlines the paper’s structure and key sections.

**Context:** 7 ITBR
**Significance:** This is a key equation representing the core constraint in ITBR, defining the level of uncertainty allowed in the agent’s inference.

**Quote:** “The agent seeks to minimize information-theoretic surprisal expressed as free energy (See Definition 3, 4).”
**Context:** 2 Active Inference Agency
**Significance:** This quote defines the objective function of active inference – minimizing free energy.

**Quote:** “Active inference allows for a realistic modeling of the very neuronal processes underwriting biological agency [27].”
**Context:** 2 Active Inference Agency
**Significance:** This quote emphasizes the biological plausibility of active inference.

**Quote:** “The expected free energy (EFE) objective function for agency in (PO)MDPs we will take from [9],[11],[10],[28]”
**Context:** 2 Active Inference Agency
**Significance:** This quote highlights the source of the EFE objective function.

**Quote:** “The agent takes the action trajectoryπ = {aτ , . . . , aT } that minimizes the cumulative expected free energyG, which is roughly the sum of the single-step EFE objective functions.”
**Context:** 2 Active Inference Agency
**Significance:** This quote defines the agent’s goal – to minimize the cumulative expected free energy.

**Quote:** “Toan extent, the agent seeks to minimize the expected free energy (EFE) of policies”
**Context:** 4 From expected utility to active inference via ITBR
**Significance:** This quote summarizes the core objective of the paper.

**Quote:** “The agent seeks to minimize information-theoretic surprisal expressed as free energy (See Definition 3, 4).
**Context:** 2 Active Inference Agency
**Significance:** This quote defines the objective function of active inference – minimizing free energy.
