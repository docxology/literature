## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle in brief… This is mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent on log model evidence or marginal likelihood.”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “Given that we are assuming nonequilibrium steady-state, the steady-state solution to the Fokker Planck system enables us to express the dynamics or flow of states in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition.”
*   Fokker-Planck Equation (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle… in terms of the Fokker Planck equation”
*   Helmholtz Decomposition (exact quote from paper) – “This decomposition divides flow into dissipative gradient flows on the self-information of any state (i.e., its negative log probability at steady-state) and a divergence free or solenoidal flow.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “This is mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent on log model evidence or marginal likelihood.”
*   Laplace Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle… in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “technically, the free energy principle… is mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent on log model evidence or marginal likelihood”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle… is mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent on log model evidence or marginal likelihood”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle… is mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent on log model evidence or marginal likelihood”
