## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference (AIF) is a computational user model that frames pointing as a continuous process of minimizing prediction error by continuously updating internal beliefs based on sensory input."
*   Bayesian Model (exact quote from paper) – "The agent’s belief about the states, dynamics and noise is represented by a Gaussian distribution.”
*   Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) (exact quote from paper) – “UKF is used to efficiently propagate Gaussian random variables through system dynamics.”
*   Second-Order Lag Model (exact quote from paper) – “The system state is described by a second-order lag model, which describes the cursor’s position and velocity.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The agent’s inference process relies on gradient descent to minimize the free energy.”
*   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (exact quote from paper) – “The agent’s belief about the system parameters is obtained via MLE.”
*   Gaussian Distribution (exact quote from paper) – “Beliefs about system states, dynamics and noise are represented by Gaussian distributions.”
*   Minimization (exact quote from paper) – “The agent’s inference process relies on minimization of the free energy.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks.”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “Matlab is used for numerical computation and simulation.”

## Datasets

*   Human Pointing Data (exact quote from paper) – “Data from six human users performing the pointing task.”
*   Target Positions (exact quote from paper) – “The targets are located at 675, 363, 50, 1125, 1438, and 1750 pixels.”
*   Target Widths (exact quote from paper) – “The target widths are 20, 60, and 100 pixels.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   End-Point Variance (exact quote from paper) – “The end-point variance measures the variability of the cursor’s final position.”
*   Standard Deviations (exact quote from paper) – “The standard deviations are used to quantify the uncertainty in the cursor’s position.”
*   Fitts’ Law (exact quote from paper) – “The performance is evaluated by comparing the results to the Fitts’ Law predictions.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual cursor positions.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “The simulations were performed using Google Colab.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “The simulations were performed on a local cluster.”
