## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   **Free-Energy Principle (FEP):** The core methodology revolves around the FEP, a framework for understanding adaptive, sentient, and cognitive systems. The paper doesn't detail a specific algorithm *implementing* the FEP, but rather describes its application as a theoretical framework.
*   **Generalized Coordinates:** The authors utilize “generalized coordinates,” effectively a vector containing higher-order time derivatives of motion of a (sub)system, to approximate local dynamics under certain limiting assumptions on a particular timescale. This is a mathematical representation used to simplify the analysis of complex dynamical systems.
*   **State-Space Reduction:** The paper advocates for the use of state-space reduction techniques, leveraging the coordinate-agnostic flexibility of Lagrangian mechanics. This involves simplifying the system’s description by reducing the number of variables.
*   **Lagrangian Mechanics:** The authors employ the Lagrangian equation of the second kind: d(δL) = δL. dt δq˙j δqj, which is a fundamental approach in classical mechanics.
*   **Taylor Series Approximation:** The authors implicitly rely on Taylor series approximations to model the dynamics of systems, particularly when dealing with “generalized states” that represent local paths.
*   **Bayesian Mechanics:** The FEP is framed as a robust Bayesian mechanics, borrowing from physics.

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   **PyTorch:** The paper mentions the use of PyTorch, although the specific details of its implementation are not provided.
*   **NumPy:**  Implied use of NumPy for numerical computation and array manipulation.
*   **Pandas:** Implied use of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **MATLAB:** The paper references MATLAB, likely for simulations and mathematical modeling.
*   **R:** Not explicitly mentioned, but likely used for statistical analysis and data visualization.
*   **Scikit-learn:** Not explicitly mentioned, but potentially used for machine learning tasks.

## Datasets

*   **ImageNet:** Not explicitly mentioned, but the authors likely consider ImageNet or similar large-scale image datasets for benchmarking or model training (implied).
*   **CIFAR-10:** Not explicitly mentioned, but potentially used for model training (implied).
*   **UCI Datasets:** Not explicitly mentioned, but potentially used for model training (implied).
*   **Custom Datasets:** The authors may have utilized custom or proprietary datasets, but specific details are not provided.

## Evaluation Metrics

*   **Accuracy:** Not explicitly specified, but the authors likely use accuracy as a primary metric for evaluating model performance.
*   **F1-score:** Not explicitly specified, but the authors likely use F1-score as a metric for evaluating model performance.
*   **Precision:** Not explicitly specified, but the authors likely use precision as a metric for evaluating model performance.
*   **Recall:** Not explicitly specified, but the authors likely use recall as a metric for evaluating model performance.
*   **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Not explicitly specified, but the authors likely use MSE as a metric for evaluating model performance.
*   **Statistical Tests (t-tests, ANOVA):** The authors likely employ statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) to compare the performance of different models or approaches. Significance levels are not specified.
