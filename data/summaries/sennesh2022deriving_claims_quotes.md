Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a formulation of active inference as minimization of path-entropy over an infinite time horizon, deriving it from optimal control principles.
2.  The core hypothesis is that active inference can be unified with decision active inference (dAI) and motor active inference (mAI) by explicitly prescribing behavior through a reference model.
3.  The paper aims to unify the computational principles behind motor active inference (the “equilibrium point” or “reference configuration” hypotheses) with broader studies of sensorimotor behavior as optimal feedback control.
4.  The authors suggest that active inference can be used to formulate a unified free energy functional for perception, motor action, and decision-making over time.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the recognition model should be updated to account for the time-varying nature of the generative model.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** “Active inference offers a principled account of behavior as minimizing average sensory surprise over time.”
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This statement encapsulates the fundamental premise of active inference – that the nervous system maintains its organization by minimizing surprise.

**Quote:** “The free energy principle, following the logic of active inference, says that organisms maintain their self-organization as a whole over time by embodying a generative model of their environment and minimizing its average surprise.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote clearly articulates the free energy principle and its connection to active inference.

**Quote:** “Early ‘non-equilibrium steady’ formulations of active inference provided probability densities over full trajectories of movement and interaction [19,20].”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote highlights the historical development of active inference and the initial focus on full trajectory modeling.

**Quote:** “In regulatory terms, this corresponds to covariation of bodily states under a ‘just enough, just in time’ mode of regulation that physiologists have labelled homeostasis [8].”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote connects active inference to established physiological concepts like homeostasis.

**Quote:** “The authors state: ‘We will explain this formulation of active inference as minimization of path-entropy over an infinite time horizon.’”
**Context:** Section 2 - Preliminaries and Notation
**Significance:** This quote explicitly states the central methodological claim of the paper.

**Quote:** “The recognition model q (with parameters φ) is conditioned on both the previous time-step t−1 and the next time-step t+1.”
**Context:** Section 2 - Preliminaries and Notation
**Significance:** This quote details the specific implementation of the recognition model, a key component of the active inference framework.

**Quote:** “The authors state: ‘We will unify motor active inference - the ‘equilibrium point’ or ‘reference configuration’ hypotheses - with the higher-level study of sensorimotor behavior as optimal feedback control.’”
**Context:** Section 6 - Discussion
**Significance:** This quote summarizes the overarching goal of the paper – to integrate active inference with established theories of motor control.
