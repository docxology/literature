Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel “thoughtseed” framework, positing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called “thoughtseeds” within the Global Workspace of consciousness.
2.  The framework integrates foundational concepts from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and the Free Energy Principle, offering a hierarchical model of cognitive states (Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition).
3.  The core hypothesis is that thoughtseeds act as emergent agents with their own internal states and dynamics, contributing to the construction of a unified and coherent conscious experience.
4.  The framework suggests that thoughtseeds are not merely representations but actively engage in predictive inference, shaping their internal models and influencing behavior.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the competition among thoughtseeds, driven by minimizing free energy, determines which thoughtseed gains dominance and shapes conscious experience.
