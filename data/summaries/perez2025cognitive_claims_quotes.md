Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The paper proposes a novel Active Inference (AIF) model combining a Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to simultaneously capture the influence of both habit violation and value discriminability on cognitive effort.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Integrating a DDM into an AIF framework will improve parameter recovery compared to pure AIF models.

3.  **Key Finding:** The AIF-DDM model successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage.

4.  **Theoretical Contribution:** The authors argue that the discrepancy in first-stage RTs stems from the experimental design, specifically the long inter-trial intervals, rather than a fundamental flaw in the model’s assumptions.

5.  **Proposed Solution:** The authors suggest several modifications to the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort.

## Important Quotes


2.  “In a decision-making task, cognitive effort may also arise from the competition between the subjective values of the available choices.” (The authors state: "In a decision-making task, cognitive effort may also arise from the competition between the subjective values of the available choices.") – *This quote defines a key component of the model.*

3.  “We test whether integrating a DDM into an AIF framework can simultaneously capture the influence of both habit violation and value discriminability on cognitive effort.” (The authors state: “We test whether integrating a DDM into an AIF framework can simultaneously capture the influence of both habit violation and value discriminability on cognitive effort.”) – *This quote describes the central research question.*

4.  “The model’s predictions did not capture the dynamics of the first stage.” (The authors state: “The model’s predictions did not capture the dynamics of the first stage.”) – *This quote summarizes a key finding of the study.*

5.  “We argue that the lack of effect on the first stage is likely due to the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model’s assumptions about cognitive effort.” (The authors state: “We argue that the lack of effect on the first stage is likely due to the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model’s assumptions about cognitive effort.”) – *This quote presents the authors’ interpretation of the results.*

6.  “In the Introduction, the authors state: ‘Cognitive effort arises from the conflict between a pre-existing belief about how to act (a habit) and an updated belief about the optimal policy.’” – *This quote provides context for the initial claim.*

7.  I have also included context where appropriate.
