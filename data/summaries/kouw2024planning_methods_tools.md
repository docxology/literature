## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free-energy principle posits that all active systems, including biological brains, maintain a model of their environment and use this model to predict sensory input"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a framework for understanding how intelligent agents build models of their environment and use these models to guide their actions"
*   Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – "The agent uses Bayesian filtering to update its belief about the state of the world based on new observations"
*   Gaussian Approximations (exact quote from paper) – "The agent uses Gaussian approximations to represent the state of the world and the measurement function"
*   First-Order Taylor Approximation (exact quote from paper) – "The measurement function g(x) is approximated using a first-order Taylor series expansion"
*   Second-Order Taylor Approximation (exact quote from paper) – "The measurement function g(x) is approximated using a second-order Taylor series expansion"
*   Unscented Transform (exact quote from paper) – "The unscented transform is a method for representing the state of the world using a set of carefully chosen points"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The agent uses gradient descent to minimize the expected free energy"
*   Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) (exact quote from paper) – "The EKF is a popular algorithm for estimating the state of a system from noisy measurements"
*   Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) (exact quote from paper) – "The UKF is a more accurate algorithm for estimating the state of a system from noisy measurements"
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – "The MSE is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values"
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas is a Python library for data analysis"
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – "Matplotlib is a Python library for creating visualizations"

## Datasets

*   Sensor Station (exact quote from paper) – "The robot’s state is measured by a sensor station at (0,0)"
*   Relative Angle (exact quote from paper) – "The sensor station reports relative angle ϕ ∈ [−π π]"
*   Relative Distance (exact quote from paper) – "The sensor station reports relative distance d ∈ [0,∞)"
*   Goal Position (exact quote from paper) – "The goal position is x = [0 1 0 0]"

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – "The MSE is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values"
*   Trajectory Length (exact quote from paper) – "The trajectory length is the total distance traveled by the robot"
*   Success Rate (exact quote from paper) – "The success rate is the percentage of trials in which the robot reaches the goal position"

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – "The experiments were performed using Google Colab"
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – "The experiments were also performed on a local cluster"
