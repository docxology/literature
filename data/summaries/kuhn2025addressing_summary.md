## Classification

- **Category**: Core Theory Math
- **Domain**: microeconomics
- **Confidence**: 0.95
- **Reasoning**: The paper's primary contribution is to establish a formal bridge between active inference (a neuroscientific theory) and expected utility theory in microeconomics. It focuses on a rigorous comparison of these two accounts of agency, utilizing information-theoretic bounds (ITBR) and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to achieve this. The paper's core contribution is therefore a theoretical framework rather than a practical application or tool.

As a unified theory of sentient behaviour, active inferenceis formally intertwined with multiple normative theories of optimal be-haviour. Specifically, we address what we call the subsumption thesis:The claim that expected utility from economics, as an account of agency,is subsumed by active inference. To investigate this claim, we presentmultiple examples that challenge the subsumption thesis. To formallycompare these two accounts of agency, we analyze the objective functionsfor MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing information-theoretic rationalitybounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent, we find that the resultantagency is equivalent to that of active inference in MDPs, but slightlydifferent in POMDPs. Rather than being strictly resolved, the subsump-tion thesis motivates the construction of a formal bridge between activeinference and expected utility. This highlights the necessary formal as-sumptions and frameworks to make these disparate accounts of agencycommensurable.Keywords: Active Inference· Expected Utility· Information-TheoreticBounded Rationality· Microeconomics1 IntroductionSince the middle of the previous century, expected utility has formed thebedrock of the agency underwriting microeconomics. With early imple-mentations dating back to Bernoulli in1713 [37], expected utility hasundergone many augmentations in order to reflect realistic deliberatedecision processes. The comprehensive start of this lineage can be tracedto the classic utility theorem [24]; [8], with earlier applications found in[31]. Subsequent accounts include Bayesian Decision Theory [34]; [6],Bounded Rationality [36]; [26], Prospect Theory [19], and many moreflavours. The algorithmic implementation of expected utility theory isfound in the Reinforcement Learning literature [3]. While seeminglydisparate, practically all expected utility accounts of agency depict anagent making decisions in a probabilistic setting to attain optimalreward – to pursue utility [5]. Coming from the completely differentbackground of neuroscience, Active Inference a comparatively newaccount of agency [12], positioning itself as “a unifying perspective onaction and perception [...] richer than the common optimization objec-tives used in other formal frameworks (e.g., economic theory arXiv:2503.05048v1 [econ.TH]6 Mar20252 Noé Kuhn and reinforcement learning)” [29, pg.1;4]. Here the agent seeks tominimize information-theoretic surprisal expressed as free energy (SeeDefinition3,4). Active inference allows for a realistic modeling of thevery neuronal processes underwriting biological agency [27].Given the breadth of successful applications [9] combined with its strongfundamental first principles [13], some proponents of active inferenceposited what we call the Subsumption thesis: Expected utility theory asseen in economics is subsumed by active inference – it is an edge case.A formulation in the same vein posits: “Active inference [...] englobesthe principles of expected utility theory [...] it is theoretically possibleto rewrite any RL algorithm [...] as an active inference algorithm” [11].So how does the subsumption thesis hold up in the given examples? Isit possible to formally delineate how expected utility and activeinference differ? This paper then establishes a firm connection betweenmicroeconomics and active inference, which has scarcely been exploredbefore [17].To formally compare the two accounts of agency, we require acommensurable space for agent-environment interactions: MDPs andPOMDPs (Definition1 and2). These agent-environment frameworks arethe bread and butter of expected utility applications [4], [3], [20]. Activeinference agency has more recently also been specified for the sameframeworks [28], [9], [10], [11]. As such (PO)MDPs provide atheoretical arena for the subsumption thesis to be evaluated.What exactly is at stake that motivates this inquiry into thesubsumption thesis? Firstly, expected utility and active inference restupon different first principles to substantiate their respective account ofagency [11]. Analysis of the formal relationship between these twoaccounts could provide insights into how the first principles of oneaccount might be a specification the other’s first principles. Secondly,this inquiry will shed light on how each account handles the explora-tion-exploitation dilemma [7]: How should an agent prioritise betweenexploring an environment versus exploiting what they already knowabout the environment for utility? Finally, if active inference trulysubsumed expected utility, then the ramifications for welfaristeconomics would be enormous: Currently, the formal mainstreamunderstanding of welfare which informs economic policy [30] is basedon aggregating individual agents acting according to expected utility[23, pg.45] [32]. The subsumption thesis challenges foundations of‘optimal’ economic policy if expected utility only captures a sliver of‘optimal’ behaviour.To investigate the subsumption thesis, the rest of the paper is structuredas follows. In section2. the agent-environment frameworks are definedalongside the relevant accounts of agency and basic concepts inmicroeconomics. In section3., some examples are investigated whichchallenge the subsumption thesis. In section4., the formal bridgebetween expected utility and active inference is established viaInformation Theoretic Bounded Rationality (ITBR) [26]. Finallysection5. provides some concluding and summarizing remarks.Addressing the Subsumption Thesis32 Preliminary Definitions and Microeconomics2.1 Agent-Environment FrameworksA finite Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical model thatspecifies the elements involved in agent-environment interaction anddevelopment [3]. This formalization of sequential decision makingtowards reward maximization originates in dynamic programming, andcurrently enjoys much popularity in model-based Reinforcement Learn-ing (RL). Although potentially reductive, employing MDPs and POMDPsallows for formal commensurability between different accounts of agency.Definition1(Finite Horizon MDP).An MDP is defined according to thefollowing given tuple:(S, A, P(s′|a, s), R(s′, a), γ=1, T)– S is a finite set of states.– A is a finite set of actions.– P(s′|a, s) is the transition probability of posterior states′ occurring uponthe agent’s selection of actiona in the prior states.– R(s′, a) ∈ R+ is the reward function taking as arguments the agent’saction and resulting state. For our purposes, the action taken will beirrelevant to the resulting reward:R(s′, a) =R(s′).– γ denotes the discount factor of future rewards. This is set to1 as thisparameter is not commonly used in the cited active inference literature.– T = {1,2, . . . , t, . . . , τ, . . . , T} is a finite set for discrete time periodswhereby t < τand the horizon isT.Note that time period subscripts e.g,sτ are sometimes omitted whenunnecessary.In a single-step decision problem, an expected reward-maximizing agentwould evaluate the optimal actiona∗ as follows:a∗t = arg maxa∈AEP(sτ |at,st)R(sτ ) (1)Further, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)generalizes an MDP by introducing observationso that contain incompleteinformation about the latent states of the environment [20,3]. The agentcan only infer latent states via observations. Thus, POMDPs are ideal formodeling action-perception cycles [13] with the cyclical causal graphicalmodela → s → o . . .Definition2(Finite Horizon POMDP).A finite horizon POMDP further addstwo elements to the previously given MDP tuple:(O, P(o|s))– O is a finite set of observations.– P(o|s) is the probability of observationo occurring to the agent given thestate s.4 Noé Kuhn2.2 Active Inference AgencyWith the environment-agent frameworks established, we can proceed to definehow an active inference agent approaches a (PO)MDP. Although funda-mental and interesting, the Variational Free Energy objective crucial toperception in active inference will not be examined here; Inference
