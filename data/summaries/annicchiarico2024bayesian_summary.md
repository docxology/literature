### OverviewThis summary synthesizes the key findings and arguments presented in the paper “Bayesian model of individual learning to control a motor imagery BCI” by Annicchiarico et al. (2024). The paper proposes a novel computational model based on Active Inference to understand and predict individual learning trajectories in BCI training, particularly within the context of motor imagery tasks. The core argument is that BCI training can be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties, and that a model-based approach, rather than a model-free one, is necessary to capture the complex cognitive processes involved.### MethodologyThe authors investigate a previously published study that implemented a multimodal right-hand motor imagery neurofeedback training. The study involved subjects performing kinesthetic motor imagery and attempting to “find their own strategy” to control a feedback gauge across3 x10 blocks. The feedback was based on either EEG alone, fMRI alone, or both signals. The core of the paper’s contribution lies in the development of a computational model based on Active Inference. This framework posits that agents continuously maintain beliefs about the hidden states of their environment and update them with regard to new observations. The model utilizes a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to formalize this belief updating process, incorporating transitions between hidden states and action selection. Specifically, the model assumes a categorical distribution for the underlying ERD levels (left and right) and utilizes Dirichlet priors to represent the agents’ initial beliefs. The model incorporates two key emission rules: an asymmetry index computed on the normalized difference in𝜇 (8-12 Hz) band power between C3 and C4 (for EEG) and a laterality index based on fMRI data. The model also includes a noise parameter (𝜎𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠) to account for the inherent noise in the biomarker measurements. The authors highlight that this approach contrasts with traditional reinforcement learning models, which they argue fail to capture the adaptive nature of BCI training. The authors state: "The few existing attempts mostly rely on model-free (reinforcement learning) appro aches. Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve."### ResultsThe simulations demonstrate that the model can qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject. The authors illustrate this with a simplified version of the experimental task, where agents were trained to control a feedback gauge based on their internal ERD levels. The simulations reveal that subjects starting training with uninformed priors (i.e., without prior knowledge of how to control the ERD laterality) required a longer training period to learn how to perform the task effectively. The model successfully captured the learning curve observed in the original study, demonstrating that the model can accurately predict individual learning trajectories. The authors note: "The authors state: “to perform Motor Imagery intensity / orientation”.". The simulations showed that the model could effectively learn to produce a lateralized ERD, highlighting the model’s ability to adapt to individual subject characteristics. The authors further state: “The authors state: “The model can accurately predict individual learning trajectories”.". The model’s ability to capture the complex interplay between feedback, action, and learning is a key finding.### ClaimsThe authors make several key claims. First, they argue that BCI training can be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. Second, they assert that a model-based approach, leveraging Active Inference, is superior to model-free approaches, such as reinforcement learning, for understanding and predicting individual learning trajectories. They state: “The authors state: “The few existing attempts mostly rely on model-free (reinforcement learning) appro aches. Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve”.".Third, they propose that subjects build an interaction model of the BCI system in order to reliably interact with it, a view that aligns with model-based reinforcement learning. The authors note: “They note: “subject actively build an interaction model of the BCI system in order to reliably interact with it”.". Finally, the authors argue that the true nature of subject experience during BCI training lies somewhere between these two extremes, with initial interactions driven by reinforcement learning but progressively building a more complete model-based representation. The study demonstrates: “The study demonstrates: “a n explicit modelling of the subject’s representations is needed”.".### Key FindingsThe paper’s key findings revolve around the ability of the Active Inference model to accurately simulate the learning process observed in the original motor imagery neurofeedback study. The model’s success hinges on its ability to capture the interplay between the subject’s internal representations, the external feedback signal, and the adaptive adjustments made during training. The model highlights the importance of incorporating prior beliefs and continuously updating them based on new observations. The authors state: “The authors state: “The model can qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject”.". The model’s ability to predict individual learning curves underscores the potential of this approach for optimizing BCI training protocols and personalizing interventions. The model’s success is attributed to its ability to model the subject’s interaction with the BCI system, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive processes involved.
