Okay, here’s a summary of the paper “Some interesting observations on the free energy principle” following all the instructions and constraints outlined above.### OverviewThis paper, authored by Karl Friston, Lancelot Da Costa, and Thomas Parr, investigates the free energy principle (FEP) as presented in Friston (2013). The authors use seven observations from Biehl et al. (2020) to drill down on the technical arguments underpinning the FEP, focusing on solenoidal coupling between states in sparsely coupled systems possessing a Markov blanket – and the distinction between exact and approximate Bayesian inference implied by this arrangement. The paper highlights the role of the FEP in self-evidencing, where systems actively seek evidence for their own existence (Colombo & Wright,2018), and the importance of the Markov blanket in defining the scope of this self-evidencing process.### MethodologyThe authors begin by contextualizing the FEP, stating that “any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference. Informally, this can be described as self-evidencing (Hohwy,2016); namely, anything that exists is actively seeking evidence for its existence.” They stipulate that a thing is defined in terms of a Markov blanket, such that internal states are independent of external states when conditioned on blanket states. Blanket states are further partitioned into active and sensory states – that are not influenced by internal and external states, respectively. By starting from a Langevin formulation of any random dynamical system, the associated density dynamics can be expressed as the solutions to the Fokker Planck equation (Ao,2005; Frank et al.,2003). Crucially, because we are (stipulatively) assuming nonequilibrium steady-state, the steady-state solution to the Fokker Planck system enables us to express the dynamics or flow of states in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition (Ao,2004; Ao,2008; Friston and Ao,2012). This decomposition divides flow into dissipative gradient flows on the self-information of any state (i.e., its negative log probability at steady-state) and a divergence-free or solenoidal flow. When this solution is expressed in terms of a Markov blanket partition, the implicit conditional dependencies require certain solenoidal coupling terms to disappear. This means that one can express the dynamics of something’s internal and active states as a function of, and only of, the blanket and internal states.### Results & Key ClaimsThe authors identify three key tenets that underpin the FEP. First, certain solenoidal coupling terms are precluded when a Markov blanket emerges under sparse coupling. The authors state: “The key observation – here and in Biehl et al (ibid) – is that certain solenoidal coupling terms are precluded.” This implies that the coupling between internal and external states is restricted, leading to a simplified dynamics. Second, the difference between the variational density and conditional density, as assessed by a KL divergence or bound, can be arbitrarily large.
