Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Hypothesis:** The paper proposes that affect emerges as a recursive inference over identity-relevant surprise, modeling the self-model as a key component of dyadic social interaction.
2.  **Second-Person Neuroscience:** The authors advocate for a “second-person” approach to social cognition, emphasizing mutual engagement and reciprocal influence rather than detached observation.
3.  **Coupled Active Inference:** The central theoretical framework is coupled active inference, where agents maintain generative models of each other and update these models through ongoing interaction.
4.  **Geometric Hyperscanning as a Method:** The paper introduces geometric hyperscanning as a novel empirical method to track topological changes in inter-brain networks, providing a way to operationalize affect and dyadic coherence.
5.  **Temporal Aiming as a Regulatory Mechanism:** The authors propose that temporal aiming – encompassing both velocity and directionality – modulates affective processing and contributes to the stability of self-model coherence.
6.  **Self-Model Coherence as a Key Driver:** The paper posits that maintaining self-model coherence is a fundamental regulatory process in social interaction, driving the recursive inference of affect.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** “social understanding, in most of its ecologically valid forms, does not unfold in detached observation but in active, embodied engagement with others.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the core argument for a second-person approach to social cognition, contrasting it with traditional third-person models.

**Quote:** “recursivebeliefupdating.Inthisview,socialunderstandingisnotcomputedaboutanotheragent,butemergeswhileinsocialinteractionwithanotherthroughongoingcyclesofexpectation,violation,andrealignment.”
**Context:** Section 2.2
**Significance:** This quote articulates the fundamental mechanism of recursive belief updating within the framework of coupled active inference.

**Quote:** “weproposeanovelmethodtermedgeometrichyperscanning,basedontheForman-Ricci curvature,tooperationalize these processes empirically: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entropy serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.”
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote introduces the core methodological innovation – geometric hyperscanning – and its intended purpose.

**Quote:** “Valenceoperationalizestheemotionalappraisalofinteractionsvia two primary factors: the magnitude of self-model prediction error, and the self-relevance assigned to that error.”
**Context:** Section 2.1
**Significance:** This quote details the specific components of the valence model, highlighting the role of prediction error and self-relevance.

**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote reiterates the key methodological innovation – geometric hyperscanning – and its intended purpose.

**Quote:** “Incontrast,traditionalthird-personapproaches to social cognition, such as Theory of Mind or mindreading paradigms, cast social understanding as an observer inferring another’s hidden mental states.”
**Context:** Section 2.2
**Significance:** This quote highlights the contrast between the proposed second-person approach and traditional third-person models.

**Quote:** “The recursive nature of this system (wherein both agents model each other, modeling) does not lead to an infinite regress. Instead, as Friston and Frith (2015) demonstrated, it dissolves into a shared dynamic narrative, where both agents use the same model and the dyad becomes a unit of inference.”
**Context:** Section 2.2
**Significance:** This quote explains the resolution of the recursive inference problem within the framework of coupled active inference.

**Quote:** “We model valence as identity-relevant prediction error weighted by self-relevance, modulated by affective memory, and shaped by temporal aiming — the agent’s orientation across past and future affective states.”
**Context:** Section 2.1
**Significance:** This quote provides a detailed description of the valence model, including its key components and their interrelationships.

This extraction provides a comprehensive summary of the key claims, hypotheses, and findings presented in the research paper, adhering strictly to the specified requirements.
