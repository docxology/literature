Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Second-Person Neuroscience as a Foundation:** The authors propose that social understanding is constituted through real-time mutual engagement, rather than detached observation, and that this view necessitates a shift from third-person to second-person neuroscience.

2.  **Recursive Affective Inference:** The central hypothesis is that affect emerges as a dynamic regulatory process guiding cognition and behavior within coupled generative systems, driven by recursive inference over self-model coherence.

3.  **Valence as Prediction Error:**  The authors model emotional valence as an inference over two types of prediction error: mismatch between predicted and observed outcomes, and those relevant to identity.

4.  **Self-Relevance as a Key Weight:**  The authors propose that self-relevance is a critical factor in shaping affective responses, modulating the magnitude of prediction error.

5.  **Temporal Aiming as a Novel Component:** The authors introduce “temporal aiming” – a mechanism that captures the agent’s orientation across past and future affective states – as a crucial element in shaping affective dynamics.

6.  **Geometric Hyperscanning as an Empirical Method:** The authors introduce geometric hyperscanning as a novel method to operationalize latent affective dynamics, using Forman-Ricci curvature to track topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks.

## Important Quotes

1.  “However, traditional models of social cognition often approach this question through the lens of mental state attribution: one agent models another’s beliefs, intentions, and emotions.” (Introduction) – *Significance:* This quote establishes the problem the authors are addressing – the limitations of traditional third-person approaches.

2.  “As Schilbach et al. [36] argue, social interaction is not simply the backdrop against which inference occurs; instead, it is the medium through which meaning is constituted.” (Introduction) – *Significance:* This quote highlights the core argument for a second-person approach – that interaction is generative of meaning.

3.  “Recent formalizations of this framework through the lens of active inference [28] have provided the missing computational scaffolding: they model interacting agents as mutually coupled generative systems that co-regulate meaning via recursive belief updating.” (Introduction) – *Significance:* This quote introduces the theoretical framework – active inference – as the solution to the problem.

4.  “We extend second-person active inference to the domain of affect, modeling it as recursive inference over two types of prediction error: mismatch between predictions and outcomes relevant to the world, and those relevant to identity.” (Abstract) – *Significance:* This quote explicitly states the central claim – that affect is modeled as recursive inference over prediction errors.

5.  “Drawing on Jiang and Luo’s [25,24] model, valence reflects an inference over the integrity of the self-model, embedded in the dyadic generative manifold.” (Abstract) – *Significance:* This quote details the specific mechanism – valence as an inference over self-model coherence.

6.  “Because both agents maintain self-models while recursively modeling each other, affective dynamics become entangled, shaping belief updating and action selection.” (Abstract) – *Significance:* This quote explains the recursive coupling – how self-modeling creates entanglement.

7.  “We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to track topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entropy serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.” (Abstract) – *Significance:* This quote introduces the empirical method – geometric hyperscanning – and its key metric – FRc entropy.

8. “HFRc entropy—reflecting the degree of network integration—serves as a proxy for affective phase transitions.” (Abstract) – *Significance:* This quote explains the role of FRc entropy as a marker of dynamic changes in interbrain networks.
