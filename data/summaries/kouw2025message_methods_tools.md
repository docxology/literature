## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The proposed agent is built on an autoregressive model, making continuous-valued observations and bounded continuous-valued actions"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a comprehensive framework that unifies perception, planning, and learning under the free energy principle, offering a promising approach to designing autonomous agents"
*   Autoregressive Model (exact quote from paper) – "The proposed agent implemented as a message passing procedure on a Forney-style factor graph"
*   Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – "We use Bayesian filtering to update parameter beliefs given y,u"
*   Mean-Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle, in its simplest form, relies on a mean-field approximation"
*   Marginal Distribution Updates (exact quote from paper) – "The agent is built on an autoregressive model, making continuous-valued observations and bounded continuous-valued actions"
*   Expectation-Value Minimization (exact quote from paper) – "We derive expected free energy minimization in a multivariate autoregressive model with continuous-valued observations and bounded continuous-valued actions"
*   Laplace Approximation (exact quote from paper) – "We perform a Laplace approximation to the posterior distribution"
*   Marginalization (exact quote from paper) – "The agent only receives noisy outputs y from a system and sends control inputs u back. It must drive the system to output y without knowledge of the system’s dynamics."
*   Mutual Information (exact quote from paper) – "E (cid:2) lnp(y |u ,D ) (cid:3) – "E (cid:2) lnp(y |u ,D ) (cid:3)"
*   Cross-Entropy (exact quote from paper) – "E (cid:2) −lnp(y |y ) (cid:3) – "E (cid:2) −lnp(y |y ) (cid:3)"
*   T-Distribution (exact quote from paper) – "p(y |µ,Σ) = T(y |µ,Σ)"
*   Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – "We use Bayesian filtering to update parameter beliefs given y,u"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn"
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – "MATLAB"
