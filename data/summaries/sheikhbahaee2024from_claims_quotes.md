## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper argues that the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) offers a more nuanced framework for understanding adaptive, sentient, and cognitive systems than previous iterations, particularly by incorporating spatio-temporal complexity and cross-scale causality.
2.  **Hypothesis:** The authors aim to improve the clarity, rigor, and applicability of the FEP by addressing idiosyncratic definitions and potential confusion arising from the mixing of physics terminology.
3.  **Finding:** The paper identifies a common issue where the FEP utilizes “generalized coordinates” – a vector containing higher-order time derivatives – which can cause confusion due to differing interpretations within the physics community.
4.  **Claim:** The authors propose that a more explicit choice of labels or a clearer explanation of differences from standard physics terminology would enhance the FEP’s accessibility and reduce potential misunderstandings.
5.  **Hypothesis:** By carefully selecting “generalized coordinates,” researchers can simplify derivations of physically meaningful constraints on a system’s dynamics.
6.  **Finding:** The paper highlights a specific example – shifting to angular coordinates to model a pendulum – as illustrating the contextual nature of this choice.
7.  **Claim:** The FEP’s claims often contain tacit assumptions, leaving the reader to reverse engineer the authors’ intended details, leading to difficulty in evaluating individual claims.
8.  **Hypothesis:** Addressing these implicit assumptions and providing more precise semantics is crucial for the FEP’s broader applicability.
9.  **Finding:** The authors point out that the FEP’s use of “strange particles” and the associated circular causation in beliefs about self-generated actions, may be premature and require further investigation.
10. **Claim:** The paper suggests that connecting the behaviour of “strange particles” with “sentience” might be premature, depending on the semantic scope of this concept.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** “Certain idiosyncratic definitions and derivative statements in this paper and prior works have tended to confuse scientists who attempt to assess the validity of such formulations in depth.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote directly states the primary motivation for the paper – to address confusion surrounding the FEP’s terminology and approach.

**Quote:** “When grappling with complex dynamical systems, manyhours of work can be saved by applying a state-spacereduction and exploiting the coordinate-agnostic flexibility of Lagrangian mechanics, where ‘generalized coordinates’ and ‘generalized velocities’ refer to q and q˙, respectively, in the Lagrange equation of the second kind: d(δL) = δL. dt δq˙j δqj”
**Context:** Discussion of “generalized coordinates”
**Significance:** This quote explains the authors’ proposed solution – leveraging Lagrangian mechanics – to avoid potential confusion with physics terminology.

**Quote:** “This quote would make most physicists frown because the action is commonly defined as the path integral of the Lagrangian – as acknowledged by the authors (see also [11]).”
**Context:** Discussion of the FEP’s use of “generalised states”
**Significance:** This quote illustrates the core point of contention – the FEP’s unconventional use of the term “action.”

**Quote:** “We make no assumptions about the solutions of this equation, other than the flow operator does not change over some relevant time interval.” (p.38)
**Context:** Discussion of implicit assumptions
**Significance:** This quote highlights a critical weakness in the FEP’s formulation – the lack of clearly defined boundary conditions, making it difficult to evaluate claims.

**Quote:** “In this setting, the Lagrangian plays the role of an action, where paths of least action minimize the Lagrangian of generalized states.” (p.36)
**Context:** Discussion of the FEP’s use of “generalised states”
**Significance:** This quote directly contrasts the FEP’s interpretation of the Lagrangian with the standard physics definition of the action.

**Quote:** “The authors invoke notions of ”strange particles” and the circular causation involved in their beliefs about their self-generated actions.” [16]
**Context:** Discussion of “strange particles”
**Significance:** This quote identifies a potentially problematic aspect of the FEP’s approach – the use of “strange particles” and the associated philosophical implications.

**Quote:** “It is required that we both deeply engage with models of consciousness for systems for which we know there are subjective experiences, as well as precisely characterize the phenomenology (in the sense used by physicists) of systems that may realize such qualitative aspects by other means.”
**Context:** Discussion of “sentience”
**Significance:** This quote emphasizes the need for a rigorous, physics-based approach to studying consciousness, grounded in empirical data.

**Quote:** “To associate the functionalities (and perhaps phenomenality) of ‘sentience’ with particles may generate further confusion by both implying the kinds of panpsychism the authors explicitly renounce, as well as potentially suggesting a kind of illegitimate eliminative reductionism concerning the values of agents with conscious experience (e.g. the ‘as if’ language used throughout the paper for the ontological status of particles with goals).”
**Context:** Discussion of “sentience”
**Significance:** This quote articulates a key concern – the potential for the FEP to inadvertently lead to panpsychist interpretations.

**Quote:** “Integrated world modeling” [20, 21].
**Context:** Discussion of “sentience”
**Significance:** This quote highlights a key functional requirement for systems to be considered sentient.

**Quote:** “The authors also allude to the concept of consciousness (using quotes from Heisenberg and David Bohm), but never clarify how it relates to their definition of ‘sentience’.”
**Context:** Discussion of “sentience”
**Significance:** This quote points out a critical omission – the lack of a clear connection between the FEP’s definition of sentience and the broader concept of consciousness.
