Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Constrained Ignorance and Surprise (exact quote from paper) – “A kind of global free energy principle of our way of thinking” – This is the core methodology.
*   Bayes Formula (exact quote from paper) – “Bayes formula” – The paper uses Bayes’ formula as a key component of its approach.
*   Maximum Entropy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “maximizing/minimizing it” – The paper leverages the maximum entropy principle.
*   Tree of Possibilities (exact quote from paper) – “we will follow the footsteps of an Ignorant person called Howard, and study the stages of his learning” – This represents the core framework for the model.
*   Updating Knowledge (exact quote from paper) – “updating his knowledge” – The process of updating the model’s state based on new information.
*   Constraints (exact quote from paper) – “constraints” – The use of constraints to define the model’s state space.
*   The model of Howard (exact quote from paper) – “Howard” – The model is built around the scenario of a person named Howard.
