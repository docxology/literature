## Classification

- **Category**: Core Theory Math
- **Domain**: Robotics
- **Confidence**: 0.95
- **Reasoning**: The paper’s core contribution lies in its application of active inference, a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian probability and information theory. It details the mathematical formulation of the generative model, the Dempster-Shafer theory for evidence fusion, and the variational free energy principle. The paper focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of the control method rather than a specific implementation or application. The paper’s emphasis on the mathematical details of the model and its application to a control problem strongly indicates a core/theory/math classification.
