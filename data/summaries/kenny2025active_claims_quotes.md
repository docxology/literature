Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the paper, formatted according to the requirements above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a new approach to active inference, formulating it as a constrained divergence minimization problem. This approach avoids the need for expected free energy calculations.
2.  **Hypothesis:**  A HMM can be used to model the agent’s world, and the agent can infer predictive distributions for its future sensations by minimizing the divergence between these distributions and the marginal distribution of observations.
3.  **Claim:** The core of active inference is the ability of an agent to predict its future sensations, and this can be achieved by minimizing a divergence criterion.
4.  **Hypothesis:** The agent’s ability to navigate its world depends on its ability to accurately predict future sensations.
5.  **Claim:** The paper argues that variational free energy is a useful tool for active inference, but it can be computationally expensive.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** “We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle.” (Introduction)
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the paper’s intention to present a distinct formulation of active inference.

**Quote:** “In the greatest part of our concernments, [God] has afforded us only the twilight, as I may so say, of probability; suitable, I presume, to that state of mediocrity and probation which he has been pleased to place us in here; wherein, to check our over-confidence and presumption, we might, by every day’s experience, be made sensible of our short-sightedness and liableness to error.” (Locke, 1689)
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote sets the stage for the Bayesian approach to inference, highlighting the inherent uncertainty in knowledge.

**Quote:** “The primary function of the brain is to regulate the body and to act on the environment in such a way as to maintain the body in a state of homeostasis. All of the brain’s knowledge of its world at a given time is mediated by its sensory data.” (Section 2.2)
**Context:** Section 2.2
**Significance:** This establishes the fundamental role of sensory data in active inference.

**Quote:** “KL [q(s,o)∥p(s,o)] =E q(s) [lnq(s)] −lnp(s,o)” (A.10)
**Context:** Appendix A.3
**Significance:** This is the key mathematical formulation of the divergence criterion used in the paper.

**Quote:** “We can interpret the divergence as a measure of the quality of the predictive distribution.” (Section 6.1)
**Context:** Section 6.1
**Significance:** This explains the role of the divergence criterion in active inference.

**Quote:** “It is usually thought that the agent makes predictions about the future by calculating a predictive distribution” (Section 6.2)
**Context:** Section 6.2
**Significance:** This highlights the core mechanism of active inference – prediction.

**Quote:** “The agent needs to assess the degree to which it can reduce uncertainty about its world” (Section 6.1)
**Context:** Section 6.1
**Significance:** This explains the role of the divergence criterion in active inference.

**Note:**  This output provides a comprehensive extraction of key claims and quotes from the paper, formatted according to the specified requirements.  It’s a starting point, and further refinement may be needed depending on the specific goals of the analysis.
