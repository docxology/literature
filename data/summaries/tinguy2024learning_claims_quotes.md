Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The core claim** is that a novel dynamic cognitive map can be constructed autonomously within an active inference framework, enabling navigation and mapping in complex, aliased environments. The authors hypothesize that this approach can replicate the navigational abilities of biological organisms.

2.  **The authors propose a generative model** that integrates visual observations and proprioception to create a cognitive map. They aim to demonstrate that this model can learn environmental structures and predict future states, even in the absence of prior knowledge.

3.  **The authors’ central hypothesis** is that a dynamic cognitive map, built through active inference, can efficiently explore and exploit environments, adapting to new observations and anticipating future states.

4.  **A key claim** is that the proposed model outperforms the Clone-Structured Cognitive Graph (CSCG) model in terms of learning environmental structures and decision-making efficiency.

5.  **The authors claim** that the model’s ability to dynamically expand its internal map, adapting to novel observations and anticipated future states, is a key differentiator.
