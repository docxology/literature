Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitutes a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy.
2.  Under this principle, biological agents develop a variety of skills, such as perception, action, planning, and learning, that agents continuously adapt along their lives.
3.  Active inference and the free energy principle have been employed to explain and simulate several complex processes across different disciplines.
4.  The variational free energy functional minimizes two forms: variational free energy, with respect to past experience, and expected free energy, for selecting future behaviors.
5.  The core of active inference is to learn a generative model of the world, allowing predicting what will happen in the future in order to avoid surprising states.
6.  The model learning process is driven by minimizing free energy, which can be achieved by maximizing the accuracy of the model.
7.  8.  ## Important Quotes

1.  "Under this principle, biological agents develop a variety of skills, such as perception, action, planning, and learning, that agents continuously adapt along their lives.” (Introduction) - *This highlights the broad scope of the theory and its implications for understanding biological systems.*
3.  "In active inference, the agent minimizes a variational free energy objective with respect to past experience that causes it to learn a generative model of the world, which allows predicting what will happen in the future in order to avoid surprising states.” (Section 2.1) - *This precisely defines the core mathematical formulation of active inference.*
4.  "The generative world model is then used in the future to plan actions that will maintain the agent in a homeostatic state that satisﬁes the agent’s preferences.” (Section 2.1) - *This clarifies the role of the model in guiding action selection.*
5.  "The agent operates an (amortized) Bayesian selection of actions that will have the least surprise with respect to its preferred state.” (Section 2.1) - *This describes the Bayesian approach to action selection.*
6.  "In theory, the agent minimizes free energy by learning a generative model of the world, which allows predicting what will happen in the future in order to avoid surprising states.” (Section 2.1) - *This reiterates the fundamental goal of active inference.*
7.  “The key to active inference is to learn a generative model of the world, allowing predicting what will happen in the future in order to avoid surprising states.” (Section 2.1) - *This reiterates the fundamental goal of active inference.*
8.  “The agent operates an (amortized) Bayesian selection of actions that will have the least surprise with respect to its preferred state.” (Section 2.1) - *This reiterates the Bayesian approach to action selection.*
