Okay, let's begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a method of inference that uses probability distributions to represent the uncertainty in our knowledge about the world”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents perceive and act in the world”
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean field approximation is a method for simplifying complex systems by replacing the interactions between individual elements with an average effect”
*   Kullback-Leibler Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL divergence is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function”
*   Discrete State Spaces (exact quote from paper) – “The agent models its world as a discrete state space”
*   Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (exact quote from paper) – “HMMs are a statistical model that describes systems that can be modeled as having internal states that are not directly observable”
*   Variational Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “Variational free energy is a measure of the energy of a system”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   Python (exact quote from paper) – “The code was implemented using Python”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a library for numerical computing”
*   SciPy (exact quote from paper) – “SciPy is a library for scientific computing”
*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is a deep learning framework”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning”

## Datasets

*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images in ten classes”
*   MNIST (exact quote from paper) – “The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified images”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “The code was executed on Google Colab”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “The code was executed on a local cluster of computers”
