Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes a novel active inference agent architecture utilizing successor representations, offering significant advantages over standard active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost.
2.  The core hypothesis is that successor representations provide a more efficient and flexible way to represent value functions within active inference, particularly by enabling dynamic adaptation to changing reward functions.
3.  The paper claims that successor representations can be directly integrated with standard active inference methods, resulting in a new agent architecture (SR-AIF).
4.  The authors state that the successor representation can be treated as a probabilistic interpretation of the standard active inference model, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
5.  The paper hypothesizes that the successor representation can be used to dynamically trade-off exploration and exploitation at runtime, offering a more sophisticated approach to reinforcement learning.

## Important Quotes

"Recent work Millidge, Tschantz, Seth and Buckley (2020) has uncovered close links between active inference and the framework of control as inference, which shows how many classical reinforcement learning algorithms can be understood as performing Bayesian inference to infer optimal actions Attias (2003); Levine (2018); Rawlik (2013); Toussaint(2009)." – *In the Introduction, the authors state: "This highlights the close relationship between active inference and classical reinforcement learning algorithms."* – *Significance:* Establishes the context of the paper’s contribution – the connection between active inference and reinforcement learning.
