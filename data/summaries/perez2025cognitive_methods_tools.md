## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference combines Bayesian inference with a generative model of the environment, allowing agents to actively shape their perceptions and actions" – mentioned in [2]
*   Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) (exact quote from paper) – “The DDM is a computational model of decision-making that assumes that choices are made by accumulating evidence until a decision threshold is reached” – mentioned in [4]
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference provides a framework for updating beliefs based on observed data” – mentioned in [2]
*   Generative Model (exact quote from paper) – “A generative model is a statistical model that can generate new data points similar to the observed data” – mentioned in [2]
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “The Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) measures the difference between two probability distributions” – mentioned in [2]
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function” – mentioned in [4]
*   First-Passage Time Distribution (exact quote from paper) – “The first-passage time distribution describes the probability of a decision being made after a certain amount of time” – mentioned in [4]
*   Second-Stage Reaction Time (exact quote from paper) – “The second-stage reaction time is the time taken to make a decision after the evidence has accumulated” – mentioned in [4]
*   Prediction Error (exact quote from paper) – “Prediction error is the difference between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome” – mentioned in [2]

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   Python (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments were conducted using Python” – mentioned in [4]
*   Scipy (exact quote from paper) – “Scipy is a Python library for scientific computing” – mentioned in [19]
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing” – mentioned in [19]
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a Python library for data analysis” – mentioned in [19]
*   Hddm (exact quote from paper) – “Hddm is a Python package for implementing the drift-diffusion model” – mentioned in [22]
*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0” – mentioned in [4]

## Datasets

*   Two-Step Task Dataset (exact quote from paper) – “The two-stage task involves participants planning two steps ahead” – mentioned in [2]

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Reaction Time (RT) (exact quote from paper) – “The RT is the time taken to make a decision” – mentioned in [4]
*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correct choices” – mentioned in [4]
*   Significant (exact quote from paper) – “Significant” – mentioned in [2]
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels” – mentioned in [2]
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels” – mentioned in [2]
