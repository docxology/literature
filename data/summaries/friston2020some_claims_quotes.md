Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper argues that the free energy principle (FEP) – as initially formulated – contains technical issues that require clarification and refinement. Specifically, it challenges the assumptions underlying the original formulation.

2.  **Hypothesis 1:** The authors hypothesize that the conditional independence assumptions inherent in the FEP are not always met in real biological systems, particularly when considering the coupling between states.

3.  **Hypothesis 2:** The authors propose that the assumption of exact Bayesian inference is often an oversimplification, and that approximate Bayesian inference is more appropriate for many biological systems.

4.  **Claim 3:** The paper asserts that the gradient flows associated with the FEP are not always straightforward and can be influenced by factors such as the Markov blanket structure.

5.  **Claim 4:** The authors argue that the FEP’s reliance on a variational free energy – which is an upper bound on the surprisal – is a key technical issue.

6.  **Claim 5:** The authors state that the FEP can be interpreted as a mechanism for self-evidencing, where a system actively seeks evidence for its own existence.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "Biehl et al (2020) present some interesting observations on an early formulation of the free energy principle in (Friston, 2013)."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the paper's purpose: to respond to and critically examine an earlier formulation of the FEP.

**Quote:** "No one likes to be told that they have made mistakes."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This is a rhetorical device used to frame the paper's critical assessment as a constructive response, not a purely negative critique.

**Quote:** "In what follows, we use the observations of Biehl et al (ibid) to drill down on the interesting points they raise – and their implications in the setting of the FEP."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:**  This highlights the paper's intention to use Biehl et al.’s observations as a starting point for a deeper analysis.

**Quote:** "Technically, the free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference."
**Context:** Technical Definition
**Significance:** This presents the core claim of the FEP – that any system in a steady state is performing Bayesian inference.

**Quote:** "In short, life is its own existence proof (Colombo and Wright, 2018)."
**Context:** Technical Definition
**Significance:** This emphasizes the self-evidencing interpretation of the FEP, where the system’s very existence is a form of evidence.

**Context:** Technical Definition
**Significance:** This explains the mechanism by which the FEP is realized – through gradient flows driven by surprisal.

**Quote:** "Crucially, because we are (stipulatively) assuming nonequilibrium steady-state, the steady-state solution to the Fokker Planck system enables us to express the dynamics or flow of states in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition3."
**Context:** Technical Definition
**Significance:** This highlights the key assumption of the FEP – nonequilibrium steady-state – and its implications for the mathematical description of system dynamics.

**Context:** Technical Definition
**Significance:** This describes the two components of the flow in the Fokker-Planck equation – dissipative and solenoidal.

**Quote:** "The question now is which solenoidal coupling terms are consistent with the conditional independencies implied by a Markov blanket ? More generally, we want to know the form of the steady-state flow that engenders the conditional independencies of a Markov blanket."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This identifies the core challenge: how to ensure that the flow of states satisfies the conditional independence assumptions of the Markov blanket.

**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This reiterates the key challenge: the need for sparse coupling to generate a Markov blanket.

**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This acknowledges that the flow of states is not always simple and can be affected by the structure of the Markov blanket.

**Quote:** "The question now is which solenoidal terms and conditional independencies admit a Markov blanket. We are interested in Markov blankets that emerge from sparse coupling among states6."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This emphasizes the importance of sparse coupling in generating a Markov blanket.

**Quote:** "The Helmholtz decomposition is not limited to linear systems. For a concise derivation of (1.1), under simplifying assumptions, please see Lemma D.1 in Friston, K., 2012. Free energy, value, and attractors. Comput Math Methods Med 2012, 937860."
**Context:** Technical Definition
**Significance:** This provides a reference to a related work for the Helmholtz decomposition.

There are four special cases of (1.6) that obtain when suppressing solenoidal coupling between sensory and external states, between active and internal states or both."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the key challenge: the need for sparse coupling to generate a Markov blanket.
