Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The paper demonstrates that active inference can be scaled to continuous control tasks, achieving sample efficiency significantly greater than strong model-free RL baselines.
2.  **Hypothesis:** Implementing a unified normative scheme based on Bayesian evidence maximization (i.e., minimizing free energy) will enable efficient exploration and learning in complex environments.
3.  **Claim:** The proposed model integrates key components: a generative model, a recognition distribution, and an active exploration strategy, to achieve robust performance.
4.  **Hypothesis:** Scaling active inference requires amortizing the inference process using function approximators, allowing for efficient learning in high-dimensional spaces.
5.  **Claim:** The model’s ability to quantify and resolve uncertainty is a critical factor in its success, enabling it to effectively explore and exploit the environment.
