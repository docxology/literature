  abstract={In this second article, we show a simple use of the Ignorance as defined in "Jaynes & Shannon's Constrained Ignorance and Surprise". By giving an example about the journey of a person, we believe to show some simple, obvious but mathematically encoded philosophical implications about how we could think, learn and memorize. In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality. In fact, as we have seen after achieving this work, applying Ignorance on the system constituting a person finally turns out to be the global approach of its local counterpart on systems like neurons, cells and other complex probabilistic systems, described using the free energy principle, a much more complex and detailed approach. The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula. We show that, using only ignorance as a single quantity, and its minimization as the main process, we can take into account his understandings, assertions, doubts and assumptions about how he perceives the world, by describing them mathematically.},

  abstract={Biehl et al (2020) present some interesting observations on an early formulation of the free energy principle in (Friston, 2013). We use these observations to scaffold a discussion of the technical arguments that underwrite the free energy principle. This discussion focuses on solenoidal coupling between various (subsets of) states in sparsely coupled systems that possess a Markov blanket - and the distinction between exact and approximate Bayesian inference, implied by the ensuing Bayesian mechanics.},

  title={A Technical Critique of Some Parts of the Free Energy Principle},
  author={Martin Biehl and Felix A. Pollock and Ryota Kanai},
  year={2020},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408v3},
  abstract={We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle, and highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences to newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the "Markov blanket" proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexample that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parameterised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.},
